We should keep on pushing with scholarships. There's still a lot lot more to go if you have the capacity for it. Like depending on how free you are this week. I can send you just like a bunch of stuff that you can apply to if you have 18 00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.600 Jenny Duan: additional time 19 00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.859 Jenny Duan: at any point. 20 00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:43.990 Jenny Duan: I think. 21 00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:50.509 huda: After I get like my personal statement done, I think I'll be a little more like. 22 00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.199 huda: I guess, free to do those things. 23 00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, totally. 24 00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.510 Jenny Duan: give me a second. 25 00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.580 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm on your doc. Now. 26 00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:09.919 Jenny Duan: let's start with just maybe going through going through line by line for the 1st essay. 27 00:17:10.399 --> 00:17:15.429 Jenny Duan: I like these like little chips that you put like the drafted brainstormed, finalized 28 00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.540 Jenny Duan: need to sign in. 29 00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.079 Jenny Duan: Okay. 30 00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:31.080 Jenny Duan: I like this. I collect data the way some people collect souvenirs. 31 00:17:32.473 --> 00:17:35.139 Jenny Duan: Every data set, every statistic. 32 00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:43.979 huda: I've decided I didn't want to do the ancestral data one, because it's a bit difficult to like focus a lot on the data aspect. And then. 33 00:17:44.342 --> 00:17:48.280 huda: I don't know. I just did not really like the idea. After thinking about it. 34 00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.930 Jenny Duan: Okay. What changed your mind? 35 00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.459 huda: I tried writing it, and then like every draft, I feel like 36 00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:05.100 huda: it was redundant. I think I don't know if it was just like like I couldn't think of like a way to frame it. So that, like the data was 37 00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.750 huda: like data, aspect was like main. The main topic. 38 00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.299 Jenny Duan: I like this. 39 00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.670 Jenny Duan: wait. How does 40 00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.670 Jenny Duan: open source DNA data relate to human migration? 41 00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.109 huda: wait which line. 42 00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.629 Jenny Duan: The year. Another is tracking human migration through open source. DNA data. 43 00:18:33.186 --> 00:18:38.739 huda: Because, like, if you see, like the open source, DNA data, it tells you about like 44 00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:56.330 huda: for example, people in like North India might have, like closer genetics to people of like European descent in comparison to people from South India who might have, like less of that genetics. And then I think 45 00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.930 huda: that just shows like how humans migrated over the years. I think that's really interesting. 46 00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.109 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. 47 00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.130 Jenny Duan: this is really, okay. This is a really good essay. 48 00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.580 huda: Thank you. 49 00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.130 Jenny Duan: Yeah, well. 50 00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:33.489 Jenny Duan: can you? Would it be possible for you to share access with my personal email address? Let me just show you what's going on. So like, okay, every time I try to go 51 00:19:34.595 --> 00:19:36.410 Jenny Duan: in, it says 52 00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:45.749 Jenny Duan: I've been signed out, and then, if I sign it, it gives me back to my personal, and then, if I try to change to my ivy, level, it just like keeps on prompting me to sign in. 53 00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.000 huda: Okay. 54 00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:48.910 huda: wait. Can you request? 55 00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.929 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can give me a second. 56 00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.390 Jenny Duan: Okay? Who just requested. 57 00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.029 huda: Okay, I just updated it. 58 00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.440 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 59 00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.420 huda: Alright! 60 00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.880 Jenny Duan: What is this? 61 00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.639 Jenny Duan: Did you do? 23, Andme. Or what is this referencing? You swabbed your cheek. 62 00:20:12.626 --> 00:20:14.369 huda: Yeah. ancestry.com. 63 00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.570 Jenny Duan: Okay. 64 00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.450 Jenny Duan: okay. 65 00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.010 Jenny Duan: is that obscure? 66 00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.540 Jenny Duan: I love this. How you connected to storytelling. I feel like that really relates to the rest of your essay 67 00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.330 Jenny Duan: this one or the rest of your profile. 68 00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.059 Jenny Duan: Do you know if this is grammatically correct, this, like colon semicolon format. 69 00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:08.920 huda: I think I'm pretty sure semicolons can act as like commas when you use like commas within, like the different like 70 00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.799 huda: statements? I guess so. 71 00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.330 Jenny Duan: Let me verify that 72 00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:36.200 Jenny Duan: it's 73 00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.160 Jenny Duan: we're just gonna change it to this. 74 00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.250 Jenny Duan: Without the I feel like the semicolon wouldn't be as effective as just a carpet. Here. 75 00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.400 huda: Okay. Yeah. 76 00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.280 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 77 00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.109 Jenny Duan: How old were you when you did this ancestry.com testing. 78 00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.330 huda: Okay. Yeah. 79 00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:34.945 huda: Oh, 80 00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.129 huda: How old was I? I think I was like 13. 81 00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.750 Jenny Duan: Continually 82 00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.189 Jenny Duan: hang out might not be the best. I'm like a little caught on this sentence right now. 83 00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.430 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need the comma here. 84 00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.740 huda: Oh! 85 00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:36.910 huda: But. 86 00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.350 Jenny Duan: Learning? 87 00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:42.930 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 88 00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.760 Jenny Duan: it's 89 00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.830 Jenny Duan: okay, how does 90 00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:31.000 Jenny Duan: what have you worked on with in relation to data like, are these connected to your code of policy projects? 91 00:24:31.903 --> 00:24:34.809 huda: No, my code with glossy project was about. 92 00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.580 huda: wait! 93 00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.739 huda: I think it was about screen time. Let let me double check. I don't 94 00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.859 huda: let me. 95 00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:53.609 huda: Oh, it was about like, computer access and 96 00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.169 huda: and like, it's correlation with 97 00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:05.449 huda: computer access. And then correlation with like, financial disparities. 98 00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.929 huda: so yeah, it's not related. It's just like 99 00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.229 huda: parts of like data science that I think are really interesting. 100 00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:27.720 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think maybe it would be powerful to insert at least one thing that you've done into this anecdote. So maybe changing. Can you change one of these to like what you've written about in in code of classy. 101 00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.400 huda: Yeah, I think 102 00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.300 huda: I think this one like matches. So I can just reward it. 103 00:26:15.616 --> 00:26:17.080 huda: Does this sound fine? 104 00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:19.630 Jenny Duan: Everyone 105 00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.400 Jenny Duan: hello 106 00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.620 Jenny Duan: to visualizing 107 00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.360 Jenny Duan: a relationship. 108 00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:45.840 Jenny Duan: This is good because it also relates to you, like your like. If you have any essays about like the small town background like an outside person. 109 00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.789 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this essay is perfect. 110 00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.610 Jenny Duan: I think, approved for final submission. 111 00:27:29.348 --> 00:27:33.411 Jenny Duan: It's 2 words, too.

But I think I I like how it turned out. So I think. 119 00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.410 huda: yeah. 120 00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:55.970 Jenny Duan: And 121 00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.349 Jenny Duan: it's great. I think it's perfect. 122 00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.510 Jenny Duan: Next, essive. 123 00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.090 huda: I don't think I changed anything since the last time. 124 00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.920 huda: Yeah. 125 00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.170 Jenny Duan: Maybe I wouldn't use the word ungodly in case it might be like a bit sensitive. 126 00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.840 huda: Oh, okay, I mean, I just, I feel like a lot of people refer to like. 127 00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.339 huda: really late night, as like ungodly hours. But I can change it. 128 00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.890 huda: Maybe like outrageous. 129 00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.150 Jenny Duan: No. 130 00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.260 Jenny Duan: maybe something like 131 00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.940 Jenny Duan: you could make it like a you could make it like 132 00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:29.000 Jenny Duan: you might catch me at what I consider peak rabbit holding hours, or like what I consider peak 133 00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.880 Jenny Duan: productivity, or just something that's like, adds a little bit more information about you if you have the room. 134 00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.050 Jenny Duan: But I think outrageous is also fine. 135 00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:43.131 huda: I? Yeah, I think I have a couple of words extra, anyway. So I could just say, like, 136 00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.420 huda: consider. 137 00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.079 huda: And then do I like just saving the time. 138 00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.360 Jenny Duan: I feel like the most productive doesn't seem like it doesn't. It's not. 139 00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.229 Jenny Duan: It doesn't seem funny enough. 140 00:30:01.237 --> 00:30:03.179 huda: I could just do like the rabbit 141 00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.110 huda: calling hours. 142 00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:13.899 Jenny Duan: The key here is to emphasize how like late nights are not a bad thing, but it's just like an opportunity for you to exercise your creativity. 143 00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.639 Jenny Duan: I feel like these examples. 144 00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.130 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to save the time here. 145 00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.930 huda: Well, would it 146 00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.470 huda: would like. 147 00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.810 huda: do you understand that? It's like late at night or. 148 00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.929 Jenny Duan: I think so, because you say you're a night owl. 149 00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.749 huda: Oh, okay, I see. Yeah. 150 00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.820 Jenny Duan: I feel like these games don't connect to building news applications. 151 00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.419 Jenny Duan: So if there is there another game that you can, I mean another class. You can reference here. 152 00:30:54.472 --> 00:30:55.680 huda: Let me search. 153 00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.740 huda: Hmm. 154 00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.399 huda: I mean, I could be. It's something basic. But introduction to game design and development. 155 00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.150 Jenny Duan: That seems good. 156 00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.320 huda: Actually, I don't know if it's still being taught, so I don't know if it'll 157 00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.480 huda: or if I could just say that. 158 00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.869 Jenny Duan: Could probably just say it to be honest. 159 00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.530 huda: Okay. 160 00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.550 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 161 00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:23.540 Jenny Duan: okay, I think for this essay. Most people have some type of analogy or framework, and 162 00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:31.229 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if I see that here like, I think this is a good essay, but I don't think it's a great essay yet 163 00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:36.780 Jenny Duan: if that makes sense like, I think it has all the component parts, but I don't think it's 164 00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.990 Jenny Duan: interesting enough yet. 165 00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.449 huda: Is there any like implement that into this existing essay or. 166 00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.810 Jenny Duan: I think. Like. 167 00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:51.089 Jenny Duan: if you like, if you like this like night owl analogy, maybe you can say like 168 00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:57.530 Jenny Duan: like you might catch or like. I'm a night owl, one of my favorite things to do 169 00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:04.530 Jenny Duan: or like you could talk you could write about like your rabbit holding routine, or like you could write about like your 170 00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:12.411 Jenny Duan: while the world is asleep like. Here's what I consider the perfect night, and then you can talk about like from 11 to 12. I 171 00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.759 Jenny Duan: like I'm playing world connections or sudoku. Then then I'm like a huge reader. 172 00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:26.860 Jenny Duan: and then maybe once I'm too tired. All I do is like zone out and stare at the picture of the Victorian woman on our wall like, who is this person? And then 173 00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.860 Jenny Duan: then you can say like, I don't know 174 00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:37.090 Jenny Duan: something like that if you want. But I I that doesn't have to be the the way that you write it. But I do think you need, like 175 00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:42.739 Jenny Duan: some type of analogy or some type of framework, to make it a little bit more interesting. 176 00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:52.428 Jenny Duan: because I don't see any like connection between, like the beginning of the essay to the end of the essay. I'm not quite sure how it like I can't predict how it's gonna 177 00:34:55.537 --> 00:34:58.320 Jenny Duan: how it's going to progress over time. 178 00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.660 huda: Okay, then then I'll 179 00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:08.889 huda: I guess I'll do the owl analogy the night Owl. Analogy. 180 00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.320 huda: It's cool. 181 00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.600 huda: but. 182 00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.600 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like, what do you like? Do you like that analogy? Do you feel like you want to try something different? 183 00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:26.150 huda: I like that analogy. I just feel like some things I don't know if I'd be able to like 184 00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:31.820 huda: fit in like. For example, this 1st part. I don't know how I'd be able to like kind of 185 00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:36.559 huda: put in that like, I'm a middle child like I'm used to like these chaotic 186 00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.799 huda: like. I mean, there's possible possibly a way like, for example, 187 00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.030 huda: like 188 00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:57.086 huda: like I don't know, like I just don't know how to implement like all aspects of it. And actually, I think, like it might help if I had like a like, maybe like a framework, or like 189 00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:05.650 huda: like an outline. Maybe I can follow. And then I can just like put these different like paragraphs into those into the analogy. 190 00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:40.659 Jenny Duan: Alright. I honestly think you could probably keep the 1st paragraph, for now and then start the rabbit hole like analogy here, like 191 00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.520 Jenny Duan: from here onwards. 192 00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.340 huda: Okay. 193 00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.580 Jenny Duan: That's me! 194 00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.897 huda: And then like to continue. I could be like 195 00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.929 huda: later throughout the night. 196 00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.540 huda: Come. 197 00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.070 huda: you'll probably catch me reading my favorite book under the tamarin tree. 198 00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:21.760 huda: and then also there was a bit that I had before was the the coho part. 199 00:39:22.114 --> 00:39:24.120 huda: I was wondering if I should 200 00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.280 huda: add that into this, as well. 201 00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.519 Jenny Duan: Why do you say this. 202 00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.230 huda: Okay. 203 00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.229 Jenny Duan: Let me just put it here. 204 00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:44.480 huda: Yeah. 205 00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.859 Jenny Duan: I don't think this part makes sense. It's almost on par. 206 00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.200 huda: yeah, I was trying to say, like. 207 00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:10.539 huda: cause I listen to jazz like while I'm doing like these like, it was originally like cramming for tests, but like we changed it. So. 208 00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:12.890 huda: yeah. 209 00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.709 huda: so what would I put here after the coho thing? 210 00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.024 Jenny Duan: If you can just say 211 00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.300 Jenny Duan: hmm. 212 00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:24.610 Jenny Duan: 10 x my productivity. 213 00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.409 Jenny Duan: or I don't know something like that. 214 00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:33.700 huda: Yeah. 215 00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.520 Jenny Duan: Carrying you through. 216 00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.900 Jenny Duan: - 217 00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:41.960 Jenny Duan: more 218 00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.619 Jenny Duan: Cs 1 0, 6 Bp sets. Then, I'll admit. 219 00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:48.859 Jenny Duan: emulate that. 220 00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.769 huda: And here do I talk about stuff I correct. 221 00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.019 huda: like what I would write about when I go there. 222 00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah. 223 00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.310 huda: So what I write about when I go there. 224 00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.220 Jenny Duan: Right about. Can you repeat that one more time. 225 00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:20.900 huda: Like the sentence. I write about everything. And I notice it says folklift. But should I like mention stuff that I'm like going to be writing about at Stanford, or stuff writing. 226 00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:21.940 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like 227 00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.739 Jenny Duan: read about everything. 228 00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.979 Jenny Duan: Then my newest 229 00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.126 Jenny Duan: daily piece. 230 00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.890 Jenny Duan: a college one. On one assignment 231 00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.450 Jenny Duan: I met local news back home 232 00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:45.879 Jenny Duan: really like that. 233 00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:47.920 huda: That's good. 234 00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.889 huda: and then should I end end it by saying like something like good night? 235 00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.549 Jenny Duan: Let me think. 236 00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.459 Jenny Duan: Let me check your word, count. 237 00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.679 Jenny Duan: You're a little over word, so. 238 00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.530 huda: Oh, I like that. 239 00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.679 Jenny Duan: Very Stanford. 240 00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:33.210 huda: Yeah. 241 00:43:49.169 --> 00:43:52.609 huda: like. Let me see how much there's over, and then I can try and cut. 242 00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.450 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let me see if you could just cut this this part. 243 00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:57.450 huda: Okay. 244 00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:04.489 Jenny Duan: Like this.

So I can. Just 249 00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.690 huda: I think this whole part. 250 00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.210 huda: That's exactly 2 50 words. 251 00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.520 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 252 00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.159 Jenny Duan: just fixing the commas here. 253 00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:28.840 Jenny Duan: No. 254 00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.519 huda: Should I get rid of on a separate note. 255 00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:12.720 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 256 00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:14.340 Jenny Duan: okay. 257 00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.570 Jenny Duan: okay, how do you feel about this essay? 258 00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:20.769 huda: I definitely think you fixed it. It's a lot more. Stanford. Now. 259 00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.460 huda: Okay. 260 00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.759 Jenny Duan: You love it?

It feels very Stanford, like everything about it. 268 00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.499 huda: Feel like I wouldn't have said like the 269 00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.459 huda: Cs 1 0, 6 Bp sets, but I think that's that might impress them. 270 00:47:53.140 --> 00:48:00.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, that's just like the Intro Cs class. So maybe you could talk to Cfs explain, maybe. 271 00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:08.310 Jenny Duan: But you'd probably be in B. But I'll just say A, because that's like the 1st Cs plus, but like you'll probably skip it. But whatever 272 00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:10.540 Jenny Duan: but 273 00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:15.530 Jenny Duan: oh, I love this opening line. 274 00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.879 huda: And then I don't think the transition is good here. But yeah. 275 00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, I think this is, I love these 2 sentences. 276 00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.940 Jenny Duan: This is confusing to me. Let me just read over everything first.st 277 00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:14.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is really good. This is also really good. It could use some shaping. But 278 00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.840 Jenny Duan: it is good, like. 279 00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.430 Jenny Duan: yeah, your writing is really strong today, like. 280 00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.109 Jenny Duan: it's really good. 281 00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.140 Jenny Duan: much better than what it than how this essay was before like this is much improved. 282 00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:36.870 huda: Thank you. Yeah, I think this one was also a bit. I feel like I was struggling for these last 2 essays, and like 283 00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.529 huda: and then I just really focused on like my rural town part. And then I came up with like 284 00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:56.870 huda: an idea of like I should talk about like the almond trees here, and cause that's also because, like Stanford's known, for, like the trees, because they're the trees, and then, like my town, is known, for like a different kind of trees, and then I I guess I kind of started off with that. 285 00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.909 Jenny Duan: This transition needs to be improved. 286 00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.259 Jenny Duan: contriving is definitely not the right word here. 287 00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:39.339 Jenny Duan: What did you say? Well, I'm talking. No, no worries. 288 00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.140 Jenny Duan: buys a 289 00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.740 Jenny Duan: maybe like self sustaining. I feel like 290 00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.920 Jenny Duan: something similar to like self-sustaining or innovative. 291 00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:53.650 huda: Yeah, I think self-sustaining is a good way to describe it. 292 00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:23.489 Jenny Duan: Where is like this mountain house on the way to San Jose, or is it like on the way to San Francisco, or like what. 293 00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:27.930 huda: Yeah, I think. Wait. Let me. 294 00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:31.209 huda: Yeah.

Limited food access, like, what does this refer to? 299 00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:43.950 huda: Like housewives who ran like like food, small businesses. Because we didn't have that many like restaurants. Look. So we didn't have access like food and like grocery stores unless we had to drive like like 40 min away. 300 00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.360 Jenny Duan: How's that? 301 00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.120 huda: That looks great. Yeah, I think 302 00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:03.060 huda: could. Community is it? Should it be community or development? 303 00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.570 huda: Or I don't know if that just says the same thing twice. 304 00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:09.039 Jenny Duan: Community, or what I missed it. 305 00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.790 huda: Or development. 306 00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.830 Jenny Duan: Community development is different 307 00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.930 Jenny Duan: of growth. 308 00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:22.380 Jenny Duan: maybe a prosperity of innovation. 309 00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.149 Jenny Duan: cornerstone of 310 00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.450 Jenny Duan: -oh. 311 00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:34.030 Jenny Duan: row. 312 00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:35.330 Jenny Duan: Hear me. 313 00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.539 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that's the right word, either. 314 00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:45.499 huda: I think community sounds a little better. 315 00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:49.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah. What other words are you considering? 316 00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.379 Jenny Duan: And do you feel like community is off? And in what ways do you feel like it's off. 317 00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.512 huda: Yeah, I just 318 00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:14.370 huda: I don't like, I think I was trying to apply it to like a broader sense about how like, I'm an innovator and I don't like. I think it kind of makes sense, though, because, like, I innovate for a community. So I think it makes sense. So 319 00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.130 huda: I was just wondering if that 320 00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:19.700 huda: like gets a point across that I'm an innovator. 321 00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.530 Jenny Duan: Community growth maybe. 322 00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:25.170 huda: Yeah. 323 00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:26.560 huda: Good. 324 00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.460 Jenny Duan: Looks like 325 00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:42.429 Jenny Duan: crimes, maybe, is not the right word. 326 00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:49.860 huda: I'd like. 327 00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:06.750 huda: I mean, like I could just use this like replacement wording for if it was like over the words.

Okay. 352 01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.709 Jenny Duan: I'm taking out community here because it's right here. 353 01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.420 huda: I can just take this word out right. 354 01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.040 Jenny Duan: No, I 355 01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.309 Jenny Duan: I think you should keep it. 356 01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:29.730 huda: Okay. 357 01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.489 huda: even if that's through keyboards. 358 01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.360 huda: Yeah. 359 01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.710 huda: this could, this would be one word, right? 360 01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:40.800 huda: Yeah. 361 01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.559 Jenny Duan: But I think 2 words. 362 01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.850 huda: I think the dash makes it one word. 363 01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.130 Jenny Duan: Is it one? Is it does it? Is it usually written with a dash or no? 364 01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:53.190 huda: I see 365 01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:58.880 huda: no. 366 01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.010 Jenny Duan: Then I wouldn't write it with a dash. 367 01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.140 huda: 9 words. 368 01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:33.449 huda: I think you could just remove one of these items like maybe garlic 369 01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:51.390 huda: so forwards. 370 01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.910 Jenny Duan: 2 words. 371 01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:03.320 huda: Okay. 372 01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:12.500 huda: could women in computer science just be women in Cs. 373 01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.310 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 374 01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.449 huda: Even when expressed through keyboards. 375 01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.400 huda: not megaphones. 376 01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.040 Jenny Duan: Okay. 377 01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:33.750 Jenny Duan: that's say, looks great. How do you feel? 378 01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.660 huda: I think that cutting is a bit painful. But yeah, I think it's good now. 379 01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:41.700 Jenny Duan: Oh! 380 01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.150 huda: Yeah. 381 01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.030 Jenny Duan: Great 382 01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.910 Jenny Duan: are these all? The long answer responses. 383 01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.690 huda: Yeah. 384 01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.640 Jenny Duan: Oh, you're done! 385 01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:53.500 Jenny Duan: How's it feel? 386 01:05:53.810 --> 01:06:01.789 huda: It feels it feels good. And I'm kind of surprised. Yeah. But I'm really happy with how the essays turned out. So yeah. 387 01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:08.510 Jenny Duan: I feel like they're really, they're really strong. They're really Stanford, and they're also really representative of you. I feel like 388 01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:14.019 Jenny Duan: we crammed. We're able to cram a lot of details into not a lot of text which is great. 389 01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:15.870 huda: Thank you. 390 01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so proud of you, it's awesome. 391 01:06:20.542 --> 01:06:23.109 Jenny Duan: Okay, most significant challenge. 392 01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.350 Jenny Duan: What do you think about this one? 393 01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.267 huda: This is really hard. 394 01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:37.139 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is, I mean, they're literally asking you like, what the most significant world challenges like. That's a really hard question to be asking like a high school kid, right? 395 01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:49.609 huda: I mean, I think there's a lot of things. But also I think we had, like a bank of America essay about this exact question, but I don't like that, so I don't think we should reuse that. But. 396 01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:50.400 Jenny Duan: Okay. 397 01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:52.650 huda: Inc. 398 01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:58.780 huda: I wanna do something like more serious rather than like 399 01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.680 huda: broad. So 400 01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:10.739 huda: I think, like a big problem with society is digital footprint, because 401 01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:26.859 huda: well, like, people don't really think like what they do online like, how it impacts people. Like, for example, like cyber bullying and like it'll affect their future. So like looking back, maybe their employers will look at it or like 402 01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.899 huda: like, it just impacts like people online. 403 01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:46.690 huda: And I guess another like perspective of that also is like how like people online don't see faces. And that's and they don't like show their own faces. So that's why I feel so impersonal and easy to like attack people. So that's like one great issue. 404 01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.999 huda: In society. 405 01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:58.140 huda: actually like, is there a way I should like approach this, because, like, I'm not sure, like the the level at which, like the problem, is supposed to be like talking about. 406 01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.340 Jenny Duan: How does that connect with your profile or other things that you're trying to share. 407 01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:28.770 huda: I think well for one like, I do content creation. So I kind of have, like firsthand experience and like, like, interacting with people online. And then like, also, like a big part of that is data. And like, that's also part of like your digital footprint. And so there's like multiple aspects to digital footprint that. 408 01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:32.159 Jenny Duan: But why is digital footprint like the biggest problem. 409 01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.019 huda: Because there's just so much bad you can do from it, like 410 01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:46.759 huda: like public opinion is now entirely dependent on the Internet, I think, and because once one person has an opinion, for example, like On, like, someone makes Tiktok about 411 01:08:46.840 --> 01:09:02.270 huda: a specific like presidential candidate, and then that like influences so many people, especially with how, like Internet's, so accessible to young people like even even young children as young as, like 8 or 7, 412 01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:07.549 huda: they have access to like all this information so quickly, and it could be a bad thing. 413 01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:09.675 Jenny Duan: Okay? 414 01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:20.659 Jenny Duan: so that sounds like like the spread of information is the issue, not digital footprint, like, I'm con curious, like, why digital footprint in in of itself is an issue. 415 01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.170 Jenny Duan: At all. 416 01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:39.549 huda: Well, I think there's just like, like, there's also the the question of like security, because digital footprint and you have like so much data about you stored with companies and everything. And, for example, like 417 01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:44.540 huda: I wear an apple watch, so like although it's secure with apple, there's like 418 01:09:44.891 --> 01:09:52.049 huda: some way that they they have like access to like what? How? What? My heart rate was at 11 o'clock, and so like. 419 01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:58.059 huda: It's kind of scary because like, your data is being sold places 420 01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.359 huda: and like people don't really realize, like the impact of like 421 01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:04.929 huda: your data being like handled by someone. 422 01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.959 Jenny Duan: Is there another way? We could describe it besides digital footprint, because I'm not sure if that's like 423 01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.460 Jenny Duan: the right wording, necessarily, but curious, like what your thoughts are. 424 01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.810 huda: Yeah, I mean, like, actually. 425 01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:35.029 huda: I could do like a different problem, because I feel like this, one relates more to cyber security. And I. I don't really think that I have much on that, like, I do have like the data science thing. But I I don't think it really relates too much. So 426 01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.439 huda: yeah, it could be something else. 427 01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.829 huda: do you actually have any examples for this one? I'm I'm kind of stumped. 428 01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:49.249 Jenny Duan: Most people write about either apathy. 429 01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.109 Jenny Duan: lack of empathy, communication, or climate change 430 01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:56.260 Jenny Duan: those are. That's pretty much what everyone writes about. 431 01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.439 huda: I remember the Bank of America, one I did one on like lack of empathy. 432 01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:05.970 Jenny Duan: I wrote, too, for my super sentimentals. 433 01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:09.610 Jenny Duan: Let me see if I can find some examples 434 01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.699 Jenny Duan: like it's basically all like 435 01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:35.439 Jenny Duan: either something like this or climate change. 436 01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.329 Jenny Duan: This is someone I know who got accepted. 437 01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.029 huda: Oh, I like the writing style. 438 01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:58.979 huda: Yeah, I like that one. 439 01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.110 Jenny Duan: Let me see if I can find another one. 440 01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.680 huda: Is it really to the Major. 441 01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:12.379 Jenny Duan: She was applying for sociology and like political science. So yeah. 442 01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.969 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think it would be kind of bad if you identified something as like the most important issue. And then it didn't relate to your major. 443 01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.540 huda: Yeah. 444 01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:28.349 Jenny Duan: Because otherwise, like, what are you doing? If that doesn't work, you're not solving what you think is the world's biggest problem. 445 01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.630 Jenny Duan: Here's another one. 446 01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.300 Jenny Duan: Yeah, see? It's like climate crisis, or like apathy. 447 01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.860 Jenny Duan: or both. That's what I'm doing right. 448 01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:49.900 huda: Like it. 449 01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:53.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, do you like it? 450 01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.530 huda: Yeah. 451 01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:56.640 huda: Wow, hmm. 452 01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:09.280 Jenny Duan: and 453 01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.120 Jenny Duan: let me see if I can find another one. 454 01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:27.177 huda: I mean, I think this relates to like a couple of my activities. But like 455 01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:32.939 huda: like the fact that like learning isn't prioritized to. It's like 456 01:13:34.112 --> 01:13:35.860 huda: users. Oh, wait. 457 01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:41.000 Jenny Duan: This one's like kind of relevant to you. 458 01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:55.199 huda: Oh, I like how it's ended in a question. 459 01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:15.579 huda: Yeah. So I was. So since I'm applying for Sts. And then hoping to concentrate in communication. And media. I noticed, that's basically just data journalism. And so I can again, kind of circle back about like, how 460 01:14:16.283 --> 01:14:17.629 huda: how like 461 01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.889 huda: education isn't or not education, but like. 462 01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:26.679 Jenny Duan: Oh, I have another idea. Wait, continue what you're saying. Sorry. 463 01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:37.230 huda: That's okay. So I was just like saying how like education might not be catered to everyone. And like data, journalism like makes it so that people can actually visualize things. 464 01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.720 huda: But yeah, I don't. I don't really like that idea. 465 01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:42.390 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say, like. 466 01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:52.830 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't. You're gonna have to think of a better way to word this. But let me just stump the idea. It's like most of our claims, a lot. So many of our claims lack evidence like we lack evidence to prove that like 467 01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.710 Jenny Duan: systems actually work. 468 01:14:55.270 --> 01:15:04.920 Jenny Duan: Think I'm thinking about like so many issues have been fixed because we've had, like the proper data to validate that either something works or doesn't work. For example, within the criminal justice system like 469 01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:07.450 Jenny Duan: recidifiz. I'll write this down. 470 01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:10.420 Jenny Duan: Davis is. 471 01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:37.770 Jenny Duan: It's like a really important organization that uses data to like, get people out of prisons who are like and who are eligible for parole and stuff, and like so many organizations like drug trials and stuff, rely on having sufficient data to like validate that they work, and a lot of the times like we see politicians like they make claims without any substantiation. For example, like when Donald Trump was like Haitian. People are eating cats and dogs like. He said that out of nowhere, and, like someone had to fact, check him, but like 472 01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:48.020 Jenny Duan: so much of our life is like, rely on all of these claims that we think are true. But, like we might not actually have evidence to validate or like, we're missing data and instances where having data would actually like 473 01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:55.939 Jenny Duan: change the way that we approach. I don't know daily life or like, think about the way that data changed Covid, or like access to information change 474 01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:59.679 Jenny Duan: like medical drug trials or so many other things. And so 475 01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:05.530 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Maybe you could do something with that. But I'm not sure exactly what that would look like as a problem or an essay 476 01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:07.490 Jenny Duan: just seems important. 477 01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:09.315 huda: Yeah, I like that idea. So 478 01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.650 huda: I don't know if it would be too polarizing if I 479 01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:24.199 huda: straight said like what Donald Trump said during the presidential debate like that would be a pretty interesting hook. 480 01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:25.510 huda: But 481 01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.269 huda: But like someone like they're like. 482 01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:40.509 Jenny Duan: Or like.

Maybe you can just start here. 526 01:19:58.980 --> 01:19:59.650 huda: Okay. 527 01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:14.120 huda: promising 528 01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.540 huda: individuals. 529 01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:19.640 huda: hmm! 530 01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:24.979 huda: Lies.

So I'm saying, society makes claims often lacking accurate data. Misinformation has caused an uproar. Promising individuals lies instead of fact. 540 01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:29.414 huda: political propaganda business marketing. 541 01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.710 Jenny Duan: Social, media. 542 01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:37.360 huda: I think these have to be lowercase. 543 01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.140 Jenny Duan: Hashtag, wars. 544 01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:43.469 huda: Yeah. 545 01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.449 huda: okay, so, double. 546 01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:56.159 Jenny Duan: What is truth? In the midst of 547 01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:59.819 Jenny Duan: all this noise? I don't know what, like something like that. 548 01:22:01.758 --> 01:22:06.359 huda: how can we? Or maybe another question like, how can we? 549 01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.320 huda: they or, we could just do like 550 01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:23.435 huda: actually, I don't know if the prompt doesn't ask anything about a solution, but like data like a like a knight in shining armor. 551 01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:25.860 huda: like? 552 01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:27.309 huda: Yes. 553 01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:32.860 huda: oh, no, I guess, like I didn't really address the part about like how data can be like 554 01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.660 huda: skewed or like 555 01:22:36.995 --> 01:22:37.880 huda: altered 556 01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.320 huda: print. 557 01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.869 huda: Does this last sentence sound good? 558 01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.180 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 559 01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:13.680 Jenny Duan: is manipulated. 560 01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:17.959 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 561 01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:40.139 Jenny Duan: you have some room to make it a little longer. 562 01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:41.130 huda: Yeah. 563 01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:51.310 huda: should I add one more example? Maybe. 564 01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:17.140 Jenny Duan: I don't. I don't love the 1st sentence and change that. But 565 01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:39.170 Jenny Duan: society loves bold claims often overlooking their substantiations, political propaganda, business, marketing, social media, hashtag wars, misinformation has caused an uproar. Promising individuals lies instead of fact, in a world where critical data is manipulated or missing altogether. What is truth. Amid all this noise. 566 01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.110 huda: Yeah, I like that. 567 01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:48.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this could. I want to take one more look at this next time we meet. 568 01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:54.100 Jenny Duan: But I think next time our goal should be to finish all the rest of these essays. Review these, and then go back to your common app. 569 01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:56.810 Jenny Duan: So 570 01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.269 Jenny Duan: that, yeah. But I feel like the your long answers look good to me, for now. 571 01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.115 huda: Thank you and 572 01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:13.050 huda: And then for Unc, actually, I'm gonna be using reusing the Stanford like 573 01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.551 huda: curiosity essay for one of the topics because the prompt is really similar. 574 01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.669 huda: this is a prompt for the Unc. One that I'm gonna use 575 01:25:23.385 --> 01:25:26.119 huda: and then for the other one 576 01:25:26.601 --> 01:25:28.359 huda: this is the other prompt. 577 01:25:29.935 --> 01:25:33.540 huda: And I'm gonna use the dumbledore essay. 578 01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:34.940 Jenny Duan: Okay. 579 01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:44.669 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, sounds good. We can talk. Can we talk more about this next time? I'm not 580 01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:49.220 Jenny Duan: a hundred percent sold on your double door. So yeah, I might need to go back and review that. 581 01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.900 Jenny Duan: Alright. I'm like Super nitpicky, but I think 582 01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.520 Jenny Duan: like it'll be helpful to have a critical look at it again. 583 01:25:58.170 --> 01:26:03.229 huda: Okay, then, like the idea as a whole, or like, just like some changes. 584 01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:07.720 Jenny Duan: I don't know how I feel about just this Dumbledore anecdote as a whole. 585 01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:12.200 Jenny Duan: but I love like the content. I just don't know about the wrapper of it. 586 01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:19.299 Jenny Duan: so I just think we can take another look. I don't know if we it like might be good. I just wanna take another look at it 587 01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:21.059 Jenny Duan: and see how it feels. After that. 588 01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.480 huda: I can draft like another version, and like. 589 01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:28.400 huda: maybe do like a different analogy, or like not. No analogy at all. 590 01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.759 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe like no fictional characters. 591 01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.410 Jenny Duan: But I would say the fictional characters 592 01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.319 Jenny Duan: like, I feel like it's probably fine, because I wrote one of my stupid essays about 593 01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:44.980 Jenny Duan: like an Aladdin analogy. So honestly, the double door is probably fine, too. 594 01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:55.389 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'd say, just keep it for now, and we can come back to it. Work on, finish the rest of these short answer responses. Sometimes the short answers are harder to write than the long answers. 595 01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.590 Jenny Duan: just because you have such limited words. 596 01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.620 huda: Yeah, I agree. And when are we meeting next? By the way. 597 01:27:04.042 --> 01:27:06.757 Jenny Duan: I believe that we've scheduled for 598 01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:16.880 Jenny Duan: We don't have a meeting tomorrow, but we have a meeting Wednesday at 6, but if you're free.

I'm not sure how much progress I'll have by then. 603 01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.909 Jenny Duan: Yeah, no, it's like no pressure. If you, I'm saying, if you want to meet. 604 01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:44.539 Jenny Duan: I could also meet around like 3, 30, or 4, 3, 45 ish, but like just. But we have a meeting Wednesday. So if you want to meet, just meet Wednesday, we could also just meet Wednesday like 605 01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:49.020 Jenny Duan: it's just depending on what you feel like you need, or how I can support you. 606 01:27:49.450 --> 01:28:00.710 huda: I guess we can meet tomorrow at 3 or 3 30. I think you said whatever time works best for you, because I think I have like a lot to get checked like my 607 01:28:00.810 --> 01:28:06.609 huda: personal statement. And then cause like the Unc. Is also due like really soon, like next year. 608 01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:10.329 huda: So I want to get that super finalized before then. 609 01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:13.720 Jenny Duan: Great. Let me set maybe house 610 01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:18.599 Jenny Duan: tentatively, like 3 45 to 4 45. Is that okay with you? 611 01:28:18.810 --> 01:28:19.939 huda: Yeah, that sounds great. 612 01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:20.910 Jenny Duan: Okay. 613 01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.839 Jenny Duan: So yeah, let's just do that tomorrow, then 614 01:28:25.415 --> 01:28:29.319 Jenny Duan: and then we still have our meeting on Wednesday.

But he should take a look because he's also read so many essays 623 01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:20.270 Jenny Duan: that if he has any feedback we can like. Look at it again, you know. 624 01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.259 Jenny Duan: Sorry.

And then. 33 00:17:44.342 --> 00:17:48.280 huda: I don't know. I just did not really like the idea. After thinking about it. 34 00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.930 Jenny Duan: Okay. What changed your mind? 35 00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.459 huda: I tried writing it, and then like every draft, I feel like 36 00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:05.100 huda: it was redundant. I think I don't know if it was just like like I couldn't think of like a way to frame it. So that, like the data was 37 00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.750 huda: like data, aspect was like main.

Another is tracking human migration through open source. DNA data. 43 00:18:33.186 --> 00:18:38.739 huda: Because, like, if you see, like the open source, DNA data, it tells you about like 44 00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:56.330 huda: for example, people in like North India might have, like closer genetics to people of like European descent in comparison to people from South India who might have, like less of that genetics. And then I think 45 00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.930 huda: that just shows like how humans migrated over the years.

I'm a night owl, one of my favorite things to do 169 00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:04.530 Jenny Duan: or like you could talk you could write about like your rabbit holding routine, or like you could write about like your 170 00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:12.411 Jenny Duan: while the world is asleep like. Here's what I consider the perfect night, and then you can talk about like from 11 to 12. I 171 00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.759 Jenny Duan: like I'm playing world connections or sudoku. Then then I'm like a huge reader. 172 00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:26.860 Jenny Duan: and then maybe once I'm too tired. All I do is like zone out and stare at the picture of the Victorian woman on our wall like, who is this person? And then 173 00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.86",

But I do think you need, like 175 00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:42.739 Jenny Duan: some type of analogy or some type of framework, to make it a little bit more interesting. 176 00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:52.428 Jenny Duan: because I don't see any like connection between, like the beginning of the essay to the end of the essay. I'm not quite sure how it like I can't predict how it's gonna 177 00:34:55.537 --> 00:34:58.320 Jenny Duan: how it's going to progress over time. 178 00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.660 huda: Okay, then then I'll 179 00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:08.889 huda: I guess I'll do the owl analogy the night Owl. Analogy. 180 00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.320 huda: It's cool. 181 00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.600 huda: but. 182 00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.600 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like, what do you like? Do you like that analogy? Do you feel like you want to try something different? 183 00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:26.150 huda: I like that analogy. I just feel like some things I don't know if I'd be able to like 184 00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:31.820 huda: fit in like. For example, this 1st part. I don't know how I'd be able to like kind of 185 00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:36.559 huda: put in that like, I'm a middle child like I'm used to like these chaotic 186 00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.799 huda: like. I mean, there's possible possibly a way like, for example, 187 00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.030 huda: like 188 00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:57.086 huda: like I don't know, like I just don't know how to implement like all aspects of it. And actually, I think, like it might help if I had like a like, maybe like a framework, or like 189 00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:05.650 huda: like an outline. Maybe I can follow. And then I can just like put these different like paragraphs into those into the analogy. 190 00:36:33.230 --> 00:36",
    ":40.659 Jenny Duan: Alright. I honestly think you could probably keep the 1st paragraph, for now and then start the rabbit hole like analogy here, like 191 00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.520 Jenny Duan: from here onwards. 192 00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.340 huda: Okay. 193 00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.580 Jenny Duan: That's me! 194 00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.897 huda: And then like to continue. I could be like 195 00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.929 huda: later throughout the night. 196 00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.540 huda: Come. 197 00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.070 huda: you'll probably catch me reading my favorite book under the tamarin tree. 198 00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:21.760 huda: and then also there was a bit that I had before was the the coho part. 199 00:39:22.114 --> 00:39:24.120 huda: I was wondering if I should 200 00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.280 huda: add that into this, as well. 201 00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.519 Jenny Duan: Why do you say this. 202 00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.230 huda: Okay. 203 00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.229 Jenny Duan: Let me just put it here. 204 00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:44.480 huda: Yeah. 205 00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.859 Jenny Duan: I don't think this part makes sense. It's almost on par. 206 00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.200 huda: yeah, I was trying to say, like. 207 00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:10.539 huda: cause I listen to jazz like while I'm doing like these like, it was originally like cramming for tests, but like we changed it. So. 208 00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:12.890 huda: yeah. 209 00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.709 huda: so what would I put here after the coho thing? 210 00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.024 Jenny Duan: If you can just say 211 00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.300 Jenny Duan: hmm. 212 00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:24.610 Jenny Duan: 10 x my productivity. 213 00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.409 Jenny Duan: or I don't know something like that. 214 00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:33.700 huda: Yeah. 215 00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.520 Jenny Duan: Carrying you through. 216 00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:3",

Can you repeat that one more time. 225 00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:20.900 huda: Like the sentence. I write about everything. And I notice it says folklift. But should I like mention stuff that I'm like going to be writing about at Stanford, or stuff writing. 226 00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:21.940 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like 227 00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.739 Jenny Duan: read about everything. 228 00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.979 Jenny Duan: Then my newest 229 00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.126 Jenny Duan: daily piece. 230 00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.890 Jenny Duan: a college one.

    "00.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, that's just like the Intro Cs class. So maybe you could talk to Cfs explain, maybe. 271 00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:08.310 Jenny Duan: But you'd probably be in B. But I'll just say A, because that's like the 1st Cs plus, but like you'll probably skip it. But whatever 272 00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:10.540 Jenny Duan: but 273 00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:15.530 Jenny Duan: oh, I love this opening line. 274 00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.879 huda: And then I don't think the transition is good here. But yeah. 275 00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, I think this is, I love these 2 sentences. 276 00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.940 Jenny Duan: This is confusing to me.

I feel like I was struggling for these last 2 essays, and like 283 00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.529 huda: and then I just really focused on like my rural town part. And then I came up with like 284 00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:56.870 huda: an idea of like I should talk about like the almond trees here, and cause that's also because, like Stanford's known, for, like the trees, because they're the trees, and then, like my town, is known, for like a different kind of trees, and then I I guess I kind of started off with that. 285 00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.909 Jenny Duan: This transition needs to be improved. 286 00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.259 Jenny Duan: contriving is definitely not the right w",

Should it be community or development? 303 00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.570 huda: Or I don't know if that just says the same thing twice. 304 00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:09.039 Jenny Duan: Community, or what I missed it. 305 00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.790 huda: Or development. 306 00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.830 Jenny Duan: Community development is different 307 00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.930 Jenny Duan: of growth. 308 00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:22.3",

So 319 00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.130 huda: I was just wondering if that 320 00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:19.700 huda: like gets a point across that I'm an innovator. 321 00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.530 Jenny Duan: Community growth maybe. 322 00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:25.170 huda: Yeah. 323 00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:26.560 huda: Good. 324 00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.460 Jenny Duan: Looks like 325 00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:42.429 Jenny Duan: crimes, maybe, is not the right word. 326 00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:49.860 huda: I'd like. 327 00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:06.750 huda: I mean, like I could just use this like replacement wording for if it was like over the words.

Okay. 352 01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.709 Jenny Duan: I'm taking out community here because it's right here. 353 01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.420 huda: I can just take this word out right. 354 01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.040 Jenny Duan: No, I 355 01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.309 Jenny Duan",
    ": I think you should keep it. 356 01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:29.730 huda: Okay. 357 01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.489 huda: even if that's through keyboards. 358 01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.360 huda: Yeah. 359 01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.710 huda: this could, this would be one word, right? 360 01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:40.800 huda: Yeah. 361 01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.559 Jenny Duan: But I think 2 words. 362 01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.850 huda: I think the dash makes it one word. 363 01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.130 Jenny Duan: Is it one? Is it does it? Is it usually written with a dash or no? 364 01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:53.190 huda: I see 365 01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:58.880 huda: no. 366 01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.010 Jenny Duan: Then I wouldn't write it with a dash. 367 01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.140 huda: 9 words. 368 01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:33.449 huda: I think you could just remove one of these items like maybe garlic 369 01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:51.390 huda: so forwards. 370 01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.910 Jenny Duan: 2 words. 371 01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:03.320 huda: Okay. 372 01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:12.500 huda: could women in computer science just be women in Cs. 373 01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.310 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 374 01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.449 huda: Even when expressed through keyboards. 375 01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.400 huda: not megaphones. 376 01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.040 Jenny Duan: Okay. 377 01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:33.750 Jenny Duan: that's say, looks great. How do you feel? 378 01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.660 huda: I think that cutting is a bit painful. But yeah, I think it's good now. 379 01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:41.700 Jenny Duan: Oh! 380 01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.150 huda: Yeah. 381 01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.030 Jenny Duan: Great 382 01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.910 Jenny Duan: are these all? The long answer responses. 383 01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.690 huda: Yeah. 384 01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.640 Jenny Duan: Oh, you're done! 385 01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:53.500 Jenny Duan: How's it fee",
    "l? 386 01:05:53.810 --> 01:06:01.789 huda: It feels it feels good. And I'm kind of surprised. Yeah. But I'm really happy with how the essays turned out. So yeah. 387 01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:08.510 Jenny Duan: I feel like they're really, they're really strong. They're really Stanford, and they're also really representative of you. I feel like 388 01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:14.019 Jenny Duan: we crammed. We're able to cram a lot of details into not a lot of text which is great. 389 01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:15.870 huda: Thank you. 390 01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so proud of you, it's awesome. 391 01:06:20.542 --> 01:06:23.109 Jenny Duan: Okay, most significant challenge. 392 01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.350 Jenny Duan: What do you think about this one? 393 01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.267 huda: This is really hard. 394 01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:37.139 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is, I mean, they're literally asking you like, what the most significant world challenges like. That's a really hard question to be asking like a high school kid, right? 395 01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:49.609 huda: I mean, I think there's a lot of things. But also I think we had, like a bank of America essay about this exact question, but I don't like that, so I don't think we should reuse that. But. 396 01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:50.400 Jenny Duan: Okay. 397 01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:52.650 huda: Inc. 398 01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:58.780 huda: I wanna do something like more serious rather than like 399 01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.680 huda: broad. So 400 01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:10.739 huda: I think, like a big problem with society is digital footprint, because 401 01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:26.859 huda: well, like, people don't really think like what they do online like, how it impacts people. Like, for example, like cyber bullying and like it'll affect their future. So like looking back, maybe their employers will look at it or like 402 01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.899 huda: like, it just impacts like people online. 40",
    "3 01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:46.690 huda: And I guess another like perspective of that also is like how like people online don't see faces. And that's and they don't like show their own faces. So that's why I feel so impersonal and easy to like attack people. So that's like one great issue. 404 01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.999 huda: In society. 405 01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:58.140 huda: actually like, is there a way I should like approach this, because, like, I'm not sure, like the the level at which, like the problem, is supposed to be like talking about. 406 01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.340 Jenny Duan: How does that connect with your profile or other things that you're trying to share. 407 01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:28.770 huda: I think well for one like, I do content creation. So I kind of have, like firsthand experience and like, like, interacting with people online. And then like, also, like a big part of that is data. And like, that's also part of like your digital footprint. And so there's like multiple aspects to digital footprint that. 408 01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:32.159 Jenny Duan: But why is digital footprint like the biggest problem. 409 01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.019 huda: Because there's just so much bad you can do from it, like 410 01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:46.759 huda: like public opinion is now entirely dependent on the Internet, I think, and because once one person has an opinion, for example, like On, like, someone makes Tiktok about 411 01:08:46.840 --> 01:09:02.270 huda: a specific like presidential candidate, and then that like influences so many people, especially with how, like Internet's, so accessible to young people like even even young children as young as, like 8 or 7, 412 01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:07.549 huda: they have access to like all this information so quickly, and it could be a bad thing. 413 01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:09.675 Jenny Duan: Okay? 414 01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:20.659 Jenny Duan: so that sounds like like the spread of information is the issue, not di",
    "gital footprint, like, I'm con curious, like, why digital footprint in in of itself is an issue. 415 01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.170 Jenny Duan: At all. 416 01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:39.549 huda: Well, I think there's just like, like, there's also the the question of like security, because digital footprint and you have like so much data about you stored with companies and everything. And, for example, like 417 01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:44.540 huda: I wear an apple watch, so like although it's secure with apple, there's like 418 01:09:44.891 --> 01:09:52.049 huda: some way that they they have like access to like what? How? What? My heart rate was at 11 o'clock, and so like. 419 01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:58.059 huda: It's kind of scary because like, your data is being sold places 420 01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.359 huda: and like people don't really realize, like the impact of like 421 01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:04.929 huda: your data being like handled by someone. 422 01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.959 Jenny Duan: Is there another way? We could describe it besides digital footprint, because I'm not sure if that's like 423 01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.460 Jenny Duan: the right wording, necessarily, but curious, like what your thoughts are. 424 01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.810 huda: Yeah, I mean, like, actually. 425 01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:35.029 huda: I could do like a different problem, because I feel like this, one relates more to cyber security. And I. I don't really think that I have much on that, like, I do have like the data science thing. But I I don't think it really relates too much. So 426 01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.439 huda: yeah, it could be something else. 427 01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.829 huda: do you actually have any examples for this one? I'm I'm kind of stumped. 428 01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:49.249 Jenny Duan: Most people write about either apathy. 429 01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.109 Jenny Duan: lack of empathy, communication, or climate change 430 01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:56.260 Jenny",
    " Duan: those are. That's pretty much what everyone writes about. 431 01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.439 huda: I remember the Bank of America, one I did one on like lack of empathy. 432 01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:05.970 Jenny Duan: I wrote, too, for my super sentimentals. 433 01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:09.610 Jenny Duan: Let me see if I can find some examples 434 01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.699 Jenny Duan: like it's basically all like 435 01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:35.439 Jenny Duan: either something like this or climate change. 436 01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.329 Jenny Duan: This is someone I know who got accepted. 437 01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.029 huda: Oh, I like the writing style. 438 01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:58.979 huda: Yeah, I like that one. 439 01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.110 Jenny Duan: Let me see if I can find another one. 440 01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.680 huda: Is it really to the Major. 441 01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:12.379 Jenny Duan: She was applying for sociology and like political science. So yeah. 442 01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.969 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think it would be kind of bad if you identified something as like the most important issue. And then it didn't relate to your major. 443 01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.540 huda: Yeah. 444 01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:28.349 Jenny Duan: Because otherwise, like, what are you doing? If that doesn't work, you're not solving what you think is the world's biggest problem. 445 01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.630 Jenny Duan: Here's another one. 446 01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.300 Jenny Duan: Yeah, see? It's like climate crisis, or like apathy. 447 01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.860 Jenny Duan: or both. That's what I'm doing right. 448 01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:49.900 huda: Like it. 449 01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:53.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, do you like it? 450 01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.530 huda: Yeah. 451 01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:56.640 huda: Wow, hmm. 452 01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:09.280 Jenny Duan: and 453 01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.120 Jenny Duan: let me see if I can find ano",
    "ther one. 454 01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:27.177 huda: I mean, I think this relates to like a couple of my activities. But like 455 01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:32.939 huda: like the fact that like learning isn't prioritized to. It's like 456 01:13:34.112 --> 01:13:35.860 huda: users. Oh, wait. 457 01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:41.000 Jenny Duan: This one's like kind of relevant to you. 458 01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:55.199 huda: Oh, I like how it's ended in a question. 459 01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:15.579 huda: Yeah. So I was. So since I'm applying for Sts. And then hoping to concentrate in communication. And media. I noticed, that's basically just data journalism. And so I can again, kind of circle back about like, how 460 01:14:16.283 --> 01:14:17.629 huda: how like 461 01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.889 huda: education isn't or not education, but like. 462 01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:26.679 Jenny Duan: Oh, I have another idea. Wait, continue what you're saying. Sorry. 463 01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:37.230 huda: That's okay. So I was just like saying how like education might not be catered to everyone. And like data, journalism like makes it so that people can actually visualize things. 464 01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.720 huda: But yeah, I don't. I don't really like that idea. 465 01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:42.390 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say, like. 466 01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:52.830 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't. You're gonna have to think of a better way to word this. But let me just stump the idea. It's like most of our claims, a lot. So many of our claims lack evidence like we lack evidence to prove that like 467 01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.710 Jenny Duan: systems actually work. 468 01:14:55.270 --> 01:15:04.920 Jenny Duan: Think I'm thinking about like so many issues have been fixed because we've had, like the proper data to validate that either something works or doesn't work. For example, within the criminal justice system like 469 01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:07.450 Jenny Duan: recidifiz. I'll write this down. ",
    "470 01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:10.420 Jenny Duan: Davis is. 471 01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:37.770 Jenny Duan: It's like a really important organization that uses data to like, get people out of prisons who are like and who are eligible for parole and stuff, and like so many organizations like drug trials and stuff, rely on having sufficient data to like validate that they work, and a lot of the times like we see politicians like they make claims without any substantiation. For example, like when Donald Trump was like Haitian. People are eating cats and dogs like. He said that out of nowhere, and, like someone had to fact, check him, but like 472 01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:48.020 Jenny Duan: so much of our life is like, rely on all of these claims that we think are true. But, like we might not actually have evidence to validate or like, we're missing data and instances where having data would actually like 473 01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:55.939 Jenny Duan: change the way that we approach. I don't know daily life or like, think about the way that data changed Covid, or like access to information change 474 01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:59.679 Jenny Duan: like medical drug trials or so many other things. And so 475 01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:05.530 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Maybe you could do something with that. But I'm not sure exactly what that would look like as a problem or an essay 476 01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:07.490 Jenny Duan: just seems important. 477 01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:09.315 huda: Yeah, I like that idea. So 478 01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.650 huda: I don't know if it would be too polarizing if I 479 01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:24.199 huda: straight said like what Donald Trump said during the presidential debate like that would be a pretty interesting hook. 480 01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:25.510 huda: But 481 01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.269 huda: But like someone like they're like. 482 01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:40.509 Jenny Duan: Or like. There's so many like health claims, like people on the Internet",
    " saying like, Oh, eat this and like, you'll like like there's so many fads and trends that like just aren't so data substantiated. 483 01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.020 huda: Yeah, I think that would be a little more 484 01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.389 huda: or a little less polarizing. 485 01:17:10.941 --> 01:17:13.820 huda: I don't know if like evidence is like the right way to like 486 01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:15.440 huda: approach my reasoning. 487 01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:22.050 huda: So aside, 488 01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.120 huda: claims 489 01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.260 huda: made in society 490 01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:32.240 huda: often lack 491 01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:34.720 huda: data 492 01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.200 huda: to back. Then. 493 01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:41.070 huda: What's the organization that you mentioned. 494 01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.330 Jenny Duan: Recidivus. 495 01:17:44.395 --> 01:17:45.520 huda: How do I spell that. 496 01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.631 Jenny Duan: I wrote it in the chat, but RECI, DIVI C. 497 01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:51.860 huda: Okay. 498 01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:55.310 Jenny Duan: Not sure if that's helpful. 499 01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.790 huda: I don't know. I I don't think I should like go into explaining what they are right, because. 500 01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:07.289 Jenny Duan: I don't think you have the word, Count, for that. 501 01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:08.470 huda: Yeah. 502 01:18:14.988 --> 01:18:17.540 huda: actually, I don't know how to explain this. 503 01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.090 Jenny Duan: This might not be the right idea either.

Maybe you can just start here. 526 01:19:58.980 --> 01:19:59.650 huda: Okay. 527 01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:14.120 huda: promising 528 01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.540 huda: individuals. 529 01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:19.640 huda: hmm! 530 01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:24.979 huda: Lies. Instead of her 531 01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:37.529 huda: political propaganda. 532 01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:53.770 Jenny Duan: I love this second, the historical moment, I say, I love B. 533 01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:57.350 Jenny Duan: This is really good.

Promising individuals lies instead of fact. 540 01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:29.414 huda: political propaganda business marketing. 541 01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.710 Jenny Duan: Social, media. 542 01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:37.360 huda: I think these have to be lowercase. 543 01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.140 Jenny Duan: Hashtag, wars. 544 01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:43.469 huda: Yeah. 545 01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.449 huda: okay, so, double. 546 01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:56.159 Jenny Duan: What is truth? In the midst of 547 01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:59.819 Jenny Duan: all this noise? I don't know what, like something like that. 548 01:22:01.758 --> 01:22:06.359 huda: how can we? Or maybe another question like, how can we? 549 01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.320 huda: they or, we could just do like 550 01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:23.435 huda: actually, I don't know if the prompt doesn't ask anything about a solution, but like data like a like a knight in shining armor. 551 01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:25.860 huda: like? 552 01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:27.309 huda: Yes. 553 01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:32.860 huda: oh, no, I guess, like I didn't really address the part about like how data can be like 554 01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.660 huda: skewed or like 555 01:22:36.995 --> 01:22:37.880 huda: altered 556 01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.320 huda: print. 557 01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.869 huda: Does this last sentence sound good? 558 01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.180 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 559 01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:13.680 Jenny Duan: is manipulated. 560 01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:17.959 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 561 01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:40.139 Jenny Duan: you have some room to make it a little longer. 562 01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:41.130 huda: Yeah. 563 01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:51.310 huda: should I add one more example? Maybe. 564 01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:17.140",
    " Jenny Duan: I don't. I don't love the 1st sentence and change that. But 565 01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:39.170 Jenny Duan: society loves bold claims often overlooking their substantiations, political propaganda, business, marketing, social media, hashtag wars, misinformation has caused an uproar. Promising individuals lies instead of fact, in a world where critical data is manipulated or missing altogether. What is truth. Amid all this noise. 566 01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.110 huda: Yeah, I like that. 567 01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:48.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this could. I want to take one more look at this next time we meet. 568 01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:54.100 Jenny Duan: But I think next time our goal should be to finish all the rest of these essays. Review these, and then go back to your common app. 569 01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:56.810 Jenny Duan: So 570 01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.269 Jenny Duan: that, yeah. But I feel like the your long answers look good to me, for now. 571 01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.115 huda: Thank you and 572 01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:13.050 huda: And then for Unc, actually, I'm gonna be using reusing the Stanford like 573 01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.551 huda: curiosity essay for one of the topics because the prompt is really similar. 574 01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.669 huda: this is a prompt for the Unc. One that I'm gonna use 575 01:25:23.385 --> 01:25:26.119 huda: and then for the other one 576 01:25:26.601 --> 01:25:28.359 huda: this is the other prompt. 577 01:25:29.935 --> 01:25:33.540 huda: And I'm gonna use the dumbledore essay. 578 01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:34.940 Jenny Duan: Okay. 579 01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:44.669 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, sounds good. We can talk. Can we talk more about this next time? I'm not 580 01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:49.220 Jenny Duan: a hundred percent sold on your double door. So yeah, I might need to go back and review that. 581 01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.900 Jenny Duan: Alright. I'm like Super nitpicky, but I think 582 01:25:54.080 ",
    "--> 01:25:57.520 Jenny Duan: like it'll be helpful to have a critical look at it again. 583 01:25:58.170 --> 01:26:03.229 huda: Okay, then, like the idea as a whole, or like, just like some changes. 584 01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:07.720 Jenny Duan: I don't know how I feel about just this Dumbledore anecdote as a whole. 585 01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:12.200 Jenny Duan: but I love like the content. I just don't know about the wrapper of it. 586 01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:19.299 Jenny Duan: so I just think we can take another look. I don't know if we it like might be good. I just wanna take another look at it 587 01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:21.059 Jenny Duan: and see how it feels. After that. 588 01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.480 huda: I can draft like another version, and like. 589 01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:28.400 huda: maybe do like a different analogy, or like not. No analogy at all. 590 01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.759 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe like no fictional characters. 591 01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.410 Jenny Duan: But I would say the fictional characters 592 01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.319 Jenny Duan: like, I feel like it's probably fine, because I wrote one of my stupid essays about 593 01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:44.980 Jenny Duan: like an Aladdin analogy. So honestly, the double door is probably fine, too. 594 01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:55.389 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'd say, just keep it for now, and we can come back to it. Work on, finish the rest of these short answer responses. Sometimes the short answers are harder to write than the long answers. 595 01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.590 Jenny Duan: just because you have such limited words. 596 01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.620 huda: Yeah, I agree. And when are we meeting next? By the way. 597 01:27:04.042 --> 01:27:06.757 Jenny Duan: I believe that we've scheduled for 598 01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:16.880 Jenny Duan: We don't have a meeting tomorrow, but we have a meeting Wednesday at 6, but if you're free. I'm free tomorrow morning, if you want to meet in the m",

Or 8, 30. 602 01:27:24.995 --> 01:27:29.240 huda: I can do that, but I'm just I. I'm not sure how much progress I'll have by then. 603 01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.909 Jenny Duan: Yeah, no, it's like no pressure. If you, I'm saying, if you want to meet. 604 01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:44.539 Jenny Duan: I could also meet around like 3, 30, or 4, 3, 45 ish, but like just. But we have a meeting Wednesday. So if you want to meet, just meet Wednesday, we could also just meet Wednesday like 605 01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:49.020 Jenny Duan: it's just depending on what you feel like you need, or how I can support you. 606 01:27:49.450 --> 01:28:00.710 huda: I guess we can meet tomorrow at 3 or 3 30. I think you said whatever time works best for you, because I think I have like a lot to get checked like my 607 01:28:00.810 --> 01:28:06.609 huda: personal statement. And then cause like the Unc. Is also due like really soon, like next year. 608 01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:10.329 huda: So I want to get that super finalized before then. 609 01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:13.720 Jenny Duan: Great. Let me set maybe house 610 01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:18.599 Jenny Duan: tentatively, like 3 45 to 4 45. Is that okay with you? 611 01:28:18.810 --> 01:28:19.939 huda: Yeah, that sounds great. 612 01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:20.910 Jenny Duan: Okay. 613 01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.839 Jenny Duan: So yeah, let's just do that tomorrow, then 614 01:28:25.415 --> 01:28:29.319 Jenny Duan: and then we still have our meeting on Wednesday.

But he should take a look because he's also read so many essays 623 01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:20.270 Jenny Duan: that if he has any feedback we can like. Look at it again, you know. 624 01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.259 Jenny Duan: Sorry.
