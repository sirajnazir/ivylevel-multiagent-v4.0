Well, how are you? 2 00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:34.290 Jenny Duan: I'm doing pretty good, too. I thought it would be good today to like for. Spend some time talking about like this issue with your counselor and your teachers, and then like what we can do to solve all this, all these things, because, like, it's gonna continue to be something like, you're always gonna need to ask for more recommendations like this is something that's gonna come up again and again. So did your teacher ever respond by the way, like any updates? 3 00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:48.200 huda: No, I've sent like, like, at least 5 like reminders by email like that, because it's kind of stressing. But yeah, I send like 5 emails. And like, he didn't reply. But 4 00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.269 huda: yeah, yeah, it's kind of frustrating. But 5 00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:04.570 huda: no, that's super super frustrating, did you? yeah. So he didn't end up submitting it in the portal. Yeah, I did email. And I haven't gotten an email back, either. So 6 00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.150 huda: II think I might try to like maybe forward my email to like another cause. I emailed it to 7 00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:24.639 huda: so there's like, if you have any questions based on admission email, this person but I think I could also like email, like the support team cause. There's like the head of admission, and there's also like the support team. 8 00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.399 huda: So II didn't like the head of omissions, but I think 9 00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.479 huda: I can forward it to them as well. 10 00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.620 Okay, that seems like a good idea to do 11 00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.710 Jenny Duan: And okay, so have you had issues with this teacher in the past? Or is this the first time that you've asked them? 12 00:02:42.960 --> 00:03:06.829 huda: So? Yeah, I asked him for for the Bank of America still leaders one and that one, too. He was kinda like I had to like. I've been reminding him like for the past month for that one and he said he would, and then he just like kinda put it off to like the last week. But yeah, I did get like I eventually, that's the one that I got the Pdf for. But yeah. 13 00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.689 huda: good enough for this one. 14 00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:25.009 huda: Yeah. Like the Pdf that you submitted to. Jason. Oh, okay, I see. I just told him, like he could literally just like copy over like the one that he wrote for the other one cause I understand, like he's kind of busy because he's like. 15 00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:51.800 huda: well, okay, to be honest, he doesn't really have like that. Demanding overall cause. He's just like the media arts teacher. Which, like it's kind of like more like, a job kind of like. Course, we just have to produce like episodes each week. So it's not really like a teaching type, of course. But yeah, it's like, it's kind of frustrating. But yeah, like, I just told them like, Oh, you can just copy and paste for the other one, and that should be fine, but 16 00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.970 huda: I don't know 17 00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.770 Jenny Duan: how's your relationship with him otherwise. 18 00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:11.609 huda: I think I mean, I think that's pretty good, because I've been like working with him for like 2 2 years and he also saw me in like video production, and like, he said, like my documentary, is really good. And 19 00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:26.450 huda: yes, like also he's at the Hackathon advisor and we'd like once, like a few like field trips and stuff and user as well. So like, I've I'd feel like we have a pretty good relationship. But 20 00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.900 huda: I think he's just lazy. 21 00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:54.789 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but that's not a good thing. When your students like actually need you like, I feel like as a teacher, that's your responsibility to be there for your students like when they ask, or if, like, the thing is, if you, I feel like, if you agree to something you need to follow through on it like if he said, No, I can't do this, then that's fine, like you just find another teacher. But if he agreed to it, and if you reminded of him for the past week. That's so unreasonable, in my opinion. 22 00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:13.099 huda: Yeah, I know, like my other teachers like I told them like a few weeks ago, and like. I've been reminding them as well, but they like at least like diligently like they just kind of submit on time. I think it might be just this teacher that like is kind of having this kind of issue. But with the other ones are, they're also kind of 23 00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:27.770 huda: They're they're kind of slacking with it, because I would ask them like at least 2 to 3 times for each one. So yeah, it's kind of they're kind of like finding it a bit annoying and inconvenient, I guess. But I mean, I just ask, anyway. 24 00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.640 Jenny Duan: Okay, well. 25 00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.090 Jenny Duan: I think, okay. 26 00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.060 Jenny Duan: let's see, do a lot of students ask them for letters of recommendation. Do you know, like, if this is a common thing that they've done in the past? 27 00:05:40.330 --> 00:06:02.519 huda: I think for my history teacher. She definitely like gets asked a lot, because, like I've had like a few like peers like asking class and everything. So I know, like she's kind of like she knows have the processes, and she kind of more diligent with that. But I'm not sure for him. I know he is like he used to be a Cs teacher. So like 28 00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.910 huda: I guess he doesn't. He only writes them for like one year actually applying to college, I think. 29 00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000 huda: But yeah, like, I don't think I've heard of anyone asking him for like some programs and everything. 30 00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's think through. Okay, let's get on your document. Let me open that up really quickly. 31 00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.289 Jenny Duan: and what I want us to do is let's make a list of all the teachers that you have. And let's like, like. 32 00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.410 Jenny Duan: kind of map out, like what you can ask them in the future and like pride about your relationship with them. Okay? 33 00:06:37.870 --> 00:07:03.679 Jenny Duan: So, starting from fresh of the year. 34 00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.090 Jenny Duan: do you have any good relationships with your teachers from freshman year? Still. 35 00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.679 huda: if not, that's okay, too. 36 00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.380 Okay 37 00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.319 Jenny Duan: was freshening during the pandemic, were you or were you in person? 38 00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:35.999 huda: I was in person? But that's like kind of when I first moved. So II didn't. Okay, there's only weird. But I don't. I don't really talk to anyone. But yeah. 39 00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.870 Jenny Duan: oh, yeah, that's not weird. That's fine. Okay, what about sophomore year. 40 00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:50.179 huda: Yeah. So I think I have a good relationship with. So my Cs teacher, she's still my Cs teacher, but her 41 00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.889 huda: and then I have like, I guess I have my English teacher, but I haven't talked to her in a while. 42 00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.020 huda: Like. 43 00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.539 Jenny Duan: hey? What's up? 44 00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:45.240 huda: Sorry. 45 00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.130 huda: No, I haven't. Okay, this is a good candidate. English teachers are usually good at writing letters of recommendation because they're good at writing. 46 00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.460 huda: So 47 00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.830 Jenny Duan: so let's keep her as a candidate. 48 00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.039 Jenny Duan: This teacher this year has supported you for the Nc. Whit. Right? 49 00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:14.960 huda: What else have you asked your for? So yeah, I've asked her for for cmu And she also got me the cte a word. It was like her recommendation. 50 00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:20.070 huda: and I think that's all. 51 00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.210 Jenny Duan: Okay. Can you write her up 52 00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.749 Jenny Duan: handwritten. Thank you. Card and breakers of flowers on Monday. 53 00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:42.259 Jenny Duan: Monday. Okay like this. Know? To do this Androgen card. Get her like flowers. Get one with a base, so she doesn't have to find a place to put it. So it's like either like a potted plant or like a flower with a base something like that. 54 00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.120 Jenny Duan: Thanks for supporting me or something, you know. 55 00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:56.270 huda: Yeah. Sophomore year. I also had my the same history teacher and the district teacher. You've asked her for what 56 00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:02.970 huda: I've asked her for. Noah Jane and Princeton. 57 00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.229 Jenny Duan: Okay, same thing on Monday. Get the flowers and the handwritten card. 58 00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.879 huda: if it's too much to carry to school on Monday, just face it like throughout the week, you know. 59 00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:20.089 Jenny Duan: like, go and get her some like flowers, a potted plan and write her handwritten card. 60 00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.899 Jenny Duan: okay, what? What other teachers did you have? 61 00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:34.959 huda: And I'm trying to think I did have. 62 00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.920 huda: I mean, I haven't talked to my chemistry teacher in a really long time. 63 00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:46.379 huda: I haven't seen him in a while as well, but we did have a pretty good relationship. I think. 64 00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:53.400 huda: he's like one time in Filmmakers Club. We had to like film in a classroom, and then he let us use his classroom. But 65 00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.629 huda: Other than that, I don't think we've interacted since then. 66 00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.169 huda: He's also a good candidate. I let let's say, like. 67 00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.950 Jenny Duan: let's give your Cs teacher and your history teacher a break. And let's 68 00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:11.239 Jenny Duan: start using these new teachers. Okay, what other teachers do you have 69 00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.680 Jenny Duan: from sophomore year? 70 00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.690 huda: And 71 00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.180 huda: I'm trying to think like I have my Spanish teacher, and she's 72 00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:40.559 huda: Next year she's gonna be teaching like ap Spanish. So she's pretty nice. Again. I haven't really talked to her a lot. But yeah, she's like, really nice and think she's like really nice to all her students. But II think she'd be. 73 00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.169 huda: She could possibly write 74 00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.640 Jenny Duan: alright, that's good to know. And then any other teachers 75 00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:56.039 huda: like my, I have a math teacher, but like she's kind of not really like personal or 76 00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.879 huda: students. So she like, wouldn't really interact with them. 77 00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.510 huda: and 78 00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:10.730 Jenny Duan: I think that's all right. That's all my courses. Okay. And then this year. Remind me of all your teachers again. 79 00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.120 huda: So I have my calculus teacher. 80 00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.039 huda: hmm! Have they written you any, Rex? 81 00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:31.059 huda: No, but like my! I don't know if this applies to everyone. My friend asked her she could write a recommendation, and she said she only writes it, for, like the actual college application. 82 00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.970 Jenny Duan: Are you asking her for college? 83 00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:45.870 huda: No, I don't think she knows me that well, like I don't think she'd write a good letter recommendation, could, you? Doesn't really know? Like my skills and everything. 84 00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.789 Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. What other teachers 85 00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.720 huda: I have? 86 00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:57.730 huda: So I have, like my media arts teacher, who I've asked for Bank of America, and I'm using 87 00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.099 Jenny Duan: there's no more. 88 00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.090 Jenny Duan: I'm so like, I'm so sorry that happened like that is really frustrating. They still haven't. 89 00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.440 huda: Yeah. 90 00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:16.280 huda: yeah, and I have. I have that same history teacher from before 91 00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:21.680 huda: and then I have the same Cs teachers before 92 00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:29.329 huda: and then I have, yeah, I have, like an English teacher like an Ap line teacher. College, right? 93 00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.600 huda: Oh, yeah. She only runs for college. Yeah. 94 00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:40.240 huda: really selective about it. She's like, she said. She only writes 10 recommendations per year. But yeah. 95 00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:53.559 huda: okay, hopefully, you can get one. Did you raise your hand and talk in English fast. Yeah, sometimes I just go to like her. Like flex session to just like talk to her. So okay, seems like you're building up a good relationship. Then. 96 00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.429 huda: yeah. okay. And then I have. 97 00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:16.100 huda: So, well, my yoga teacher doesn't really know me. And then, yeah, cause we have to take like 2 years of PE and then in sophomore year, I wanted to take like media and computer science and Spanish. So I didn't have space for PE then. So yeah. 98 00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.000 huda: And then 99 00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.970 huda: I have my physics teacher. 100 00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.090 huda: So again, he's kind of like 101 00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.220 huda: he's kind of not really personal, but 102 00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.480 huda: I mean, I think if I talk to him he could possibly write one. 103 00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.459 huda: Yeah, like, I don't like. I don't think I've ever like talked to him, or like, raise my hand in class. But 104 00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.770 Jenny Duan: Ok, you need to start raising your hand in class, and then maybe in like one month we can ask him for letters of recommendation. 105 00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.839 huda: yeah, that's all yeah. 106 00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:13.209 Jenny Duan: okay, so the teachers that we have as new candidates are the English user the cam teacher and the Spanish teacher from last year. So, okay, that's that's good to know and then your counselor, how's your Rec. How's your relationship with your counselors any better. I know you said your counselor got annoyed. But 107 00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:31.790 huda: it's bad like. I don't think we have a good relationship at all. She's like like when I walked in. She's like, Oh, your hooter right? And I was like, yeah, so it's kinda like she she like knew who I was. I felt like I think it was a negative connotation. 108 00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:52.190 Jenny Duan: Okay, go bring her some flowers in a card on Monday. This one is the first priority be like Hi, like just whenever you when you see her next time you in person, tell her, like, you know, that you've been asking for a lot. And like, you know how hard it is, and like, just like, really empathize with her and be like, Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. And like. 109 00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.079 Jenny Duan: because she's going to write, she's going to have to write some stuff for your college application 110 00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:06.520 Jenny Duan: like about you. Yeah. I did not know that they asked for a school report? And their counsel fills that out 111 00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:15.370 huda: it's not like that personal stuff, it's like more like, what Ca, Hu, what classes are you taking like stuff like that? 112 00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.799 huda: Okay. yeah, I'll try to like get her like a physical card, and maybe like a gift. 113 00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:43.010 huda: And like also like like last time. Also, when I came to our office, I was like, I was like, I'm really sorry, like, I know, this is kind of last minute and like, I'm really sorry, cause II know this is like really sudden but yeah, I really need this right now. But it's totally okay if you can't do it. But yeah, thank you. And she's still kind of mad. But 114 00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:54.299 Jenny Duan: okay, I think you need some practice like really being like super empathetic, and like trying to give her like a positive impression of you. Because I feel like 115 00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.169 Jenny Duan: you. You just need to like. 116 00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:02.120 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like like, act it. If you can't promote it like you need to act it like, really be like. 117 00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:16.399 Jenny Duan: find out what type of students do you know what type of student she likes? What's her character? Because I like definitely, teachers have like, sometimes they have like types of personalities that they like better or like they get along with better like, what do you think her personalities like? 118 00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:41.700 huda: Well, I think she just okay. So well, my friend, she has the same counselor and like her brother also is the same counselor, and so, like my friend will ask like academic questions, and she won't really be interested or reply, but, like her brother, kind of talks about more personal things and like. So she's like more interested in that. So I think maybe like if I open up to personally, maybe she'd be more interested. But 119 00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:42.890 huda: I'm not sure. 120 00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you can do that like 121 00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:55.579 Jenny Duan: you can talk to her and be like, Thank you so much like you can like, open up about her like, be personal with like your life. You can be like, yeah, like, I don't really like. 122 00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:03.049 Jenny Duan: like, I'm finding out about opportunities last minute, like, I don't know that much about this college application process. It's like, really difficult, like 123 00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:13.659 Jenny Duan: being in this really stressful environment, can say, like, my parents like are both like got laid off. So I don't have these resources like, I am feeling like a lot of stress with my peers like you, just just like 124 00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:24.700 Jenny Duan: be like, open yourself up so that she feels like I don't know like more like pitting you, or is able to help you in that way, too. It's like a good strategy. But I think, like. 125 00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:35.820 Jenny Duan: I think you, yeah, you should try to improve your relationship with your counsellor, but I think, are you scared of her at all like, I guess, is there? How are other people's relationships with her, too. 126 00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:57.799 huda: To be honest, like anyone who like comes here for, like academic, like like changes to their transcript or like other academic help. I feel like they don't really have a great relationship with her, because everyone just kinda knows her as like the counselor that does nothing but like there's like other counselors which actually do things but 127 00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:09.150 huda: like like she just doesn't. But and then I'll also try like email the other counselors, because, like they, they're also available. And they just like kind of forward it to her. And she gets annoyed. And like. 128 00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:17.470 huda: yeah, so it's just kind of unfortunate. But if II did have a last name it would be better. But yeah, 129 00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.340 huda: yeah, I think, like 130 00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:29.069 huda: other people, they don't really have like a positive relationship with it, either. But I think that was like trying to like empathize with her as well would be more helpful. 131 00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.199 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think something I want you to do is 132 00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.709 Jenny Duan: Oh, actually, before I ask you about this, have you? Did you get an update from Nicholas at all. 133 00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.989 huda: He just kinda like ever since I sent the message. He just kinda like like 134 00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.270 huda: didn't read it. 135 00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.810 Jenny Duan: Oh, has. How long has it been. 136 00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.740 huda: It's been like 2, 3 days. 137 00:19:53.210 --> 00:20:02.559 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's fine. He's probably just like doing the terms and not checking it. Wait like a week. And then, if he doesn't respond, follow up. But what I wanted to do is, I want this week. I want you to 138 00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.479 Jenny Duan: cold message 10 people on Linkedin 139 00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:16.719 Jenny Duan: that you admire for whatever reason, and ask them to coffee. Chat with you. Ask them to set up a Zoom Meeting, and I want you to go and practice talking to people from all different backgrounds. This is your homework. 140 00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.199 Jenny Duan: Find 10 people, and like 141 00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:28.820 Jenny Duan: set up chats with them. They could be college students, they could be professionals. They could be other high school students. It doesn't matter. Just reach out to 10 strangers on Linkedin, because I think. 142 00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:41.639 Jenny Duan: like learning how to talk to adults and like, tell your story and explaining like who you are. What you're interested in is really really good practice. For, like learning, how different people react to situations and like knowing how to present yourself. 143 00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:42.710 Jenny Duan: So 144 00:20:43.030 --> 00:21:03.579 Jenny Duan: that's like one thing. Just reach out and confirm 10 calls. You don't necessarily need to call all the 10 people in one week, cause that's like a lot of calls, just 30 min conversations. But like, go find 10 people, reach out to them and like set up 10 calls within the next, like one to 3 weeks. I think that'll be really good practice for you. And then how's your relationship with your principal. 145 00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:16.719 huda: So I think. I think it's pretty good. So since that like situation with Notre Dame. Like my dad kind of like escalated a bit. But 146 00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:37.740 huda: like he did mention like my award and everything and so like, yeah, I think also, since I would soon use. We like interviewed him a few times, and like like he's like open up kind of person. He's like, oh, I used to go to this other school, and I see the principal there. So like, I think, relationships fine. I don't think like 147 00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.909 huda: we know, like I don't really know him that well and like I don't think he knows me that well. 148 00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:48.590 huda: So I wouldn't necessarily think that he'd be able to give a recommendation. 149 00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:56.420 Jenny Duan: Alright. Is there any way you could set up like office hours with your principal, or like, go and talk chat with him for like 30 min. Get to know him more. 150 00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:14.009 huda: I could. But okay, so the thing is like the the faculty at our school. I feel like they only like they only want like meetings, which I kind of have a purpose, you know. So like like when when you just like, go in to like talk about like 151 00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:21.250 huda: like casual things like like your life, or something like they wouldn't really be interested. So like 152 00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.620 huda: I don't know. Maybe I could like talk to him about and see wit, or something like that. 153 00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:36.549 Jenny Duan: Does your school have any like my school? My high school has, like social Justice Week. Does your school do any like assemblies, or anything focussed on like justice or advocacy? 154 00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:42.600 huda: well, we like one time we had like. 155 00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:50.239 huda: We just haven't kind of speakers come in but like, I don't really think we have anything about social justice. 156 00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:57.080 huda: Okay? Cause I was wondering, okay, do you guys have like assemblies or anything cause 157 00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.740 Jenny Duan: could you talk like. 158 00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.439 huda: do you guys have a student council at your school? Yeah. 159 00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:13.819 Jenny Duan: that is different from like, if, like, different person government like something that's a council that talks with like administration. And like, maybe parent teacher association. And like other schools. 160 00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:20.980 huda: I think it's just as B, yeah. 161 00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.460 Jenny Duan: maybe like 162 00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:37.600 Jenny Duan: you could talk to your, did your school have an AI use policy like AI usage? Chat? Gbt in class type of policy? I don't think it's explicitly set in like the rules or anything. 163 00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:46.250 Jenny Duan: Okay, maybe you can go talk to your principal about setting up in each attribute used policy, the highly used policy in school. 164 00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.879 huda: Oh, would that make you an OP. I think that would make me an OP. 165 00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.019 Jenny Duan: Okay. Okay? Cause I was thinking like. 166 00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:00.719 Jenny Duan: what is one way you can like like, what's. 167 00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.440 huda: oh, is it better or so? Yeah. 168 00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:10.320 Jenny Duan: maybe you could like, I think you should try to find opportunities to like talk to him about like 169 00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:18.960 Jenny Duan: like what other things, that teachers would really care, like student, mental health. but like 170 00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.659 Jenny Duan: what your school can do to better accommodate student mental health 171 00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:38.830 Jenny Duan: like, does your school have any like mental health policy, plan anything, work with your counselors? You can like talk set up a meeting with the counselors, develop like student mental health, like plans, policy stuff like that. And you could also work with your principal to do that. 172 00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:55.489 huda: Yeah. I guess we have, like we have this thing called a wellness center, where, like you could just go in and like play like fidget toys and stuff. And and then there's like mental health events that they hold there. It's just like a little like area in the office. But yeah. 173 00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.919 Jenny Duan: can you lead a mental health event? 174 00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.489 huda: I think it's run by administration. 175 00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.820 Jenny Duan: Okay with the counselors. How many counselors are there? And is there like 176 00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.400 Jenny Duan: someone working like at front desk at the counselor's office. 177 00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:24.720 huda: Yeah. So I believe there's like 4 or 5 councillors. And yeah, there is someone at the Counselors office in the front desk. Okay. How close are you with this front desk? Person? 178 00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:30.459 huda: Not at all. I'd like to talk to them once bear to know this front desk person really? Well. 179 00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:51.699 Jenny Duan: be, have them be like, feel like buddies with the front desk person. This is like a good strategy, because, like they will, they will help you a lot, too, if, like, they can help you. If you're friends with this front desk person, they can help you like, get time on the counselors, calendars they can help you like with a lot of stuff. So does the front desk person help schedule meetings, or like, what is their what is their job? 180 00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:57.970 huda: Their job is just like kind of filing papers. If you wanna schedule a meeting like 181 00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:05.990 huda: there's like an online form that you have to fill out. And then they like, pull you out of class and like, talk to you about it. But yeah. 182 00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.810 Jenny Duan: but does the front desperate? Do not schedule the meetings? 183 00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.920 huda: Oh, no. 184 00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:32.050 huda: okay. It's okay. I think if your friend 185 00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:54.079 huda: so yeah, I think like they kind of like help with the paperwork for the counselors, because the counselors like have a lot of people work with transcripts and stuff like that. But I don't think they're in charge. There's like another person in charge of like the Wellness center, like mental health events. And like, yeah, she's pretty nice. But yeah, I go in there a few times. 186 00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.930 Do you know her? Well, because I think it'd be good to get to know her a lot. 187 00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:05.519 huda: Not exactly like, I think, like I've been like, recently, I've been going into the wellness center quite a bit. But yeah. 188 00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.520 Jenny Duan: okay, let's see 189 00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:14.679 Jenny Duan: sounds like. So all of these people who like you, might not directly interface with 190 00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:28.229 Jenny Duan: 1 s, they are really important for you to get to know and try to establish good relationships with them, too, because they have the power to like, connect you with, like your counselor, your principal, and also like 191 00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:37.349 Jenny Duan: kind of give you more resources, too. So I think I would try to develop a good relationship with them as well. And just the principle have like 192 00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:42.850 Jenny Duan: that associate, or like secretary, or someone who like schedules their meetings for them. 193 00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:51.980 huda: I think there's like there's advice principles. I'm not sure if that's what they're chart in charge of. 194 00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.360 huda: But 195 00:27:54.590 --> 00:28:00.689 huda: yeah, I mean, like, I could probably like like talk to him like personally, just to like book a meeting, maybe. 196 00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:05.040 huda: But yeah, it's probably more like like personally asking. 197 00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.390 Jenny Duan: What are your vice principals in charge of? 198 00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:27.070 huda: I'm not totally clear cause I know some of them like there's like 3 vice principals, and so like one like facilitated like the cte award. And then, like they kind of make sure like campuses fine and like they just like kind of like, walk around during lunch. 199 00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.840 huda: And 200 00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.440 huda: I guess they're also like help with the security. 201 00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.289 huda: I don't exactly know like what their job is like behind, like like 202 00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:49.049 huda: like what their job is like for the school outside of, you know. Just like checking to make sure, like, the kids aren't skipping class and stuff. But yeah, this kind of 203 00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.489 huda: what I see them doing most of the time. 204 00:28:52.240 --> 00:29:14.629 Jenny Duan: I think if you can get into a close relationship with your vice principals as well, that could also be really good, because I think, like they might be slightly less busy than a principal, but still have, like a lot of power as school administrators, and they would be able to write you letters of a recommendation, too, and like support you in different ways. So I think, try to get into a good relationship with them as well if you can. 205 00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:37.359 huda: Yeah, I think so. I'm sorry. One of my vice principals. She's like also like a South Asian woman, and she also like she's one of the people that handed me the award for the cte thing like. So I think that's pretty cool, and then also like my past experience with her is like she see me like applying to like 206 00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:55.279 huda: last year before I kind of like before, kind of knew about my summer programs. Like, actually, I was like appliance like a Berkeley summer program and she saw me, and she's like, Oh, you know, I used to go to Berkeley. That's really cool that you're applying. So I think she'd be like supportable, like writing recommendations and stuff. 207 00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:08.580 huda: Oh, if if she from California, if she went to Berkeley. Then she definitely understands like grind, you know. So I could like start being more like. 208 00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:22.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, it's really, I think if you can go in with a mission. It's good like you should set up a time with her. But don't try to waste your time like. Don't just feel like, oh, I just want to chat about life. You can. You can still chat about life. But it's good to have like 209 00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:31.639 Jenny Duan: a topic like, Go in and say, like, okay, I wanna talk about how our school can better improve our mental health plan and how our school can 210 00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.540 Jenny Duan: increased school spirit, how our school can like 211 00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:39.040 Jenny Duan: raise more money for like a football team like I don't know whatever you 212 00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:48.170 Jenny Duan: think it. Do you have any ideas like, I think if you schedule some time with her and talk about like some specific issue that you would like to talk about. I think she'd be receptive to that. 213 00:30:49.810 --> 00:31:05.199 huda: I could probably talk about okay, well, I can't really think of anything right now. Maybe 214 00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:26.009 Jenny Duan: if you like, developing like a responsible technology use plan is like, kind of cool, but I don't know like that might make you an OP. But it like no, I think I don't know cause at Stanford, like a lot of professors allow students to use AI like at their disposal. 215 00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:39.680 huda: But I think it's like chat, like other AI. Tools are blocked from our Wi-fi. Well, like there's nothing like explicitly saying analogies wi-fi, but like, it's like blocked from every device. 216 00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.370 huda: So action. 217 00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.950 huda: Maybe 218 00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.100 Jenny Duan: if you could improve one thing about your high school, what would it be? 219 00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.739 huda: Music? A lot 220 00:31:53.090 --> 00:32:02.179 huda: like. Say, cause there's like people like doing drugs in class at my school and 221 00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:19.500 huda: like, I think, school spirit in general, like in our schools, like really bad, like, no one really likes your school and like, it's the thing the thing is like we've been trying to like, improve that with like student use. But like no one watches student use either. So 222 00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:46.140 huda: oh, okay, wait. I have an idea. So in advisory. We have, like our like advisory classes. Every Thursday we have this thing called like so to grow, and with like talk about our feelings, or whatever and like no one really does it. But like, maybe if we could find if I could think of like a better solution to some to grow and like, ask her if we could implement that. And maybe that could be a good idea. 223 00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.179 Yeah, I mean, improving school sphere is a really 224 00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:54.830 Jenny Duan: important thing, and so is like. how do we ensure that? Students like. 225 00:32:54.950 --> 00:33:03.859 Jenny Duan: how do we decrease absenteeism and like decrease drug usage in schools like that's also something you can think about like how to how to tackle 226 00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.830 huda: do you have any ideas about like 227 00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.999 Jenny Duan: how you would approach these things. 228 00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:31.970 huda: Oh, yeah, sorry. I forgot to mention before like this. Some to grow thing was kind of like a like a mental health check in so like they're supposed to talk about like, oh, how's your week today? How? How would you overcome this struggle? And stuff like that? But it's still kind of like, really sap. Consider sappy and like, people don't really do it. So maybe, like. 229 00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:41.760 huda: I could probably research into like another website that we can integrate into our school or like another convenient way, like an app or something. But 230 00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.150 huda: yeah. 231 00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.260 Jenny Duan: do you guys have a mental health awareness club, or like a mental health club. 232 00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:56.749 huda: We probably do like we have a one called Melodies for Anxiety, where, like it shows like how like 233 00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:05.039 huda: anxiety could be reduced with like music and stuff. But yeah, I don't think there's one for just mental health. 234 00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.550 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 235 00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:15.229 Jenny Duan: okay. When I was in high school. I started a Mental Health Awareness Club, and that was like something that I was really passionate about and did like a lot of work in. 236 00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:26.609 Jenny Duan: But like. Maybe if you could bring that up with, you know your or something like to do something. That's also how I kind of got close to like my counselor, and like my principal, too, is because, like 237 00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:36.179 Jenny Duan: mental health is something that, like, you know, counselors care about like principles, care about stuff like that. So I think that's like a pretty interesting way to get into that or like. 238 00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.110 Jenny Duan: if you could like. 239 00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.650 Jenny Duan: how specifically would you change the so to grow program. 240 00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:58.880 huda: I'm probably so like a lot of like the main reason why people don't use this because they have to pull out their chromebooks, and then they have to go into the like kind of wait for it to connect to the Wi-fi and everything. So I think, finding like an alternative app which is like, kind of. 241 00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:22.420 huda: okay, this is kind of like bias, but like more gamified, I guess. Like a more interesting way rather than just like writing down your feelings and like like, it just takes a really long time. So there, it'll probably be something like more simple. And I'm sure there's like there's definitely like apps out there that like are that are quicker and like more fun for the kids. But 242 00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:31.379 huda: yeah, that's how I would improve it. But I think I think I'll look into like specific apps that we can use. 243 00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.550 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 244 00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.050 Jenny Duan: Wonder 245 00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.730 Jenny Duan: is. 246 00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:58.290 Jenny Duan: I don't know if your school could host like Another thing that my high school did was like we had a like a social justice like Day, where, like a bunch of speakers and people came in to like talk about experience with like different social justice issues like that's another. 247 00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.949 Jenny Duan: I think. Interesting opportunity that maybe you could start 248 00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:06.849 Jenny Duan: at your school, too. But like any type of like big. 249 00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.199 Jenny Duan: I guess types of 250 00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.680 Jenny Duan: projects that you can 251 00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:18.410 Jenny Duan: start. Your school could be like good ways to connect with your counselors and teachers. 252 00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:36.150 Jenny Duan: So like a mental health awareness, something like this. So to grow or starting like a social justice awareness, like Speaker series day, like some type of things to show your leadership at your school, I think, could be really really powerful or like, if you could give your advice on how to restructure. Maybe, like 253 00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:45.849 Jenny Duan: I don't know some part of the the health curriculum, or something like that, too, like drug in terms of like drug mitigation, or I don't know something like that. 254 00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.919 Jenny Duan: because I think the drug issue is also like something that 255 00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.470 Jenny Duan: you know is tied along with mental health. And like also the school spirit. 256 00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.610 huda: Yeah, why do you feel like school spirit at your school is an issue? 257 00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:08.269 huda: Sorry. My, I think it's I think my Internet's kind of bad. 258 00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:13.669 Jenny Duan: I said, why do you feel like spirit at your school? Is an issue like, what do you think is the root cause of that. 259 00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:37.119 huda: I guess, like. The only way to explain is that everyone kind of thinks it's like cringe. So like like leadership students, they kind of have to like deck all out for, like the spare weeks and stuff like that. And then, like their student use. And we have, like all these ways to improve improve student culture. 260 00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:47.199 huda: but like a lot of there's like the whole thing where everyone's like, oh, that's so embarrassing. And like it's kind of irritating because everyone's just trying to have fun. But 261 00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.060 huda: I think. like another part of it is because it's 262 00:37:53.830 --> 00:38:06.340 huda: kind of not cater to everyone, cause like, it's like the humor that we use in zoom using stuff. It. It might just not be like people will understand it. I'm just like building a specific culture. 263 00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:12.940 huda: It's kind of tough. And there's like, not a lot of reason behind it. It's just that it's cringe. So 264 00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:13.930 huda: yeah. 265 00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:23.319 Jenny Duan: how do we make cringe into cool? That's like, that's a hard yeah, that's a hard issue. And I think it's like a lot of people are 266 00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:29.160 Jenny Duan: scared, or maybe don't feel comfortable, but like. I guess. 267 00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:44.109 Jenny Duan: how do you tackle that? Do I think something that my student use account did is made a Tiktok account, and they would like interview our teachers and like, make funny videos with like our administration like, think that actually got a lot of attention. And people really like that. 268 00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:51.249 Jenny Duan: So that's not good. That's a good idea. I think, for school morale. 269 00:38:52.830 --> 00:39:05.969 Jenny Duan: So some things that some other things at my school that like system we're out. These are not necessarily things that you'd need to in implement, just like some ideas we have, like a student teacher like basketball tournament. We're like the teachers, so like 270 00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.090 Jenny Duan: for one assembly, and they were like 271 00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:13.799 Jenny Duan: like our gym. That's the huge thing. For some reason, like 272 00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.679 Jenny Duan: What else do we do. 273 00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:32.639 huda: I think deal with the tech talks is really good cause. That way, like, maybe like, I could build my relationships with certain teachers as well like, and the counselor and vice principals and everything cause. Maybe we could like. 274 00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:50.650 huda: like, you know how. So we go on around like interviewing the students and almost student needs to show like every Thursday. But like, I think, if we have like on Instagram, like, we try to upload like interviews with like faculty. That'd be good. So like I could probably like 275 00:39:50.660 --> 00:40:08.370 huda: like interview like after everything's kind of cool down and like settle them account, so I could try to interview her and like the vice principal, maybe, like our principal, and like other faculty members, I think that's a really good idea actually, and then does your school have, like any type of 276 00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.509 Jenny Duan: random acts of kindness? Club? 277 00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:21.360 huda: I think sometimes they have random acts of kindness. as like a spirit like activity, spirit, day activity. 278 00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.690 Jenny Duan: I wonder if your school could start like, 279 00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.230 Jenny Duan: maybe like a 280 00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.760 Jenny Duan: hmm. 281 00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.310 Jenny Duan: like, okay. 282 00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:52.219 Jenny Duan: I think if you wanted to do something for mental health awareness month at your school. There's a lot you can do for mental health awareness. Month like mental health awareness. Month is in May, so it's not too late to like plan and do something in May. It's not too late to like coordinate like a pretty widespread campaign for your school like. I think it'd be a very powerful thing if 283 00:40:52.220 --> 00:41:07.409 Jenny Duan: if you could figure out how to do like some sort of mental health awareness month like celebration, like day of awareness. Something like that, like something that I did at my school that was like really simple, was just ordered a bunch of green ribbons, which is a symbol of like mental health awareness, and just like 284 00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.309 Jenny Duan: literally, how people wear them for like one day 285 00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:15.470 Jenny Duan: and office. And that's like a pretty powerful thing. I think you can do to like. 286 00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:16.940 Jenny Duan: you know. 287 00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:39.420 Jenny Duan: or like have, like an anonymous message for that, like how people share their experiences with like different mental health issues. To show people that they're not alone like or like writing kind letters. To like strangers is is one thing like, I think if you search of like mental health awareness month, like school activities, you can probably come up with like a lot of different things, you know. So I feel like, if you did like. 288 00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.440 Jenny Duan: or even if you did, did your school have like a daily announcements, or Daily News, or something like that 289 00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:49.079 Jenny Duan: if you could do like one mental health strategy in the Daily Newsletter every single day 290 00:41:49.170 --> 00:42:05.350 Jenny Duan: during the month of May like that, could also, like small things like that have really big impacts and like it will show your leadership, and it will help you to build your relationship with your principal and your counselor to. If you want to do something like that, I think that could be a good idea. 291 00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.790 huda: Yeah. yeah, I think 292 00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:20.449 huda: so there's like 2 people from leadership that do like the daily announcements. So I could. So there are like forms where you can get something announced, and then maybe like 293 00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:26.270 huda: cause, I know, for like black black 294 00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.589 huda: history month. History month. Yeah. 295 00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:45.729 huda: They did like every single day. They're like talking about one like important like black historical figure. And I think that's really cool. And like, I actually did learn a lot from that. So maybe we could do something similar with mental health awareness. Month. 296 00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:50.960 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I definitely think so. And I think instead of submitting the form, you should go and 297 00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.430 Jenny Duan: talk to them one on one like, Are you friends with these people? 298 00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:03.180 huda: No, but II do like I have like talked to them in the past. I could probably like talk to them again. 299 00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.379 Jenny Duan: Hmm, okay. I think you should go and do that 300 00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.829 Jenny Duan: like. Go 301 00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:22.809 Jenny Duan: talk to them, be friends with them, and like, mention it in person and like frame that as like a collaboration with them, does that make sense be like, Oh, we wanna like collaborate or like, launch this together 302 00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:26.530 huda: and then do that. Okay, yeah. 303 00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.570 Jenny Duan: And then also, like. 304 00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.570 Jenny Duan: are they are, are these people like popular kids? Or are they like normal? 305 00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.190 Oh, that makes sense. 306 00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:46.340 huda: Okay. So one of them are popular. Kit is a popular kid, and then the other one's just kinda like, I think, like my friends are friends with them. So oh, yeah. 307 00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.619 Jenny Duan: okay, I think you should try to start like 308 00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:59.279 Jenny Duan: being friends with popular people like like, Don't, okay, don't be mean, but I think it's good to like as a student, to be someone who's generally like. 309 00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:27.759 Jenny Duan: well liked or well regarded like you don't have to be like in the popular group. But like, try to branch outside your like circle and try to like talk to people from different groups, more and more, because I think, like teachers will recognize that to you and like, if students speak positively about you, and everyone's like, Oh, who does like really cool like? Who does super nice like that also reflects well on you, because it'll allow you like more collaboration opportunities with other students from different organizations and things like that the people who will support you if you start a club or 310 00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.420 huda: and something else, you know. 311 00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.520 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 312 00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:41.049 Jenny Duan: yeah. Do you have any other questions about like 313 00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:56.949 huda: how to improve your relationship with your teachers and you. And we could spend more time on this, too, next week, too. Yeah. So you know how those teachers I haven't really talked to this year, but like they were nice, and we had a great relationship last year. How do I kind of go about like 314 00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:08.400 huda: kind of talking to them again, and then like slowly working my way up to like, ask them, asking them for recommendation. So I don't want them to think that I'm only talking to them because of the recommendation. But like. 315 00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:28.080 Jenny Duan: yeah, stop from their office like for their classroom like during your flex or during that period. And then also after school, just to Hi, just want to see how your like years going wanted to see, we can catch up and then talk to them. They have office hours. Just go to the office hours, talk to them, and you can mention like, oh, like, you know, this has been, it's been really busy, like 316 00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:43.400 Jenny Duan: I've been trying to like, explore my interests in like computer science. I've been trying to get deeper in this. But like, so I'm applying to a ton of programs. But it's been challenging, just mentioned that you're like, plant the seed in their brain that you're applying programs. And then, like, the next time you see them. And like. 317 00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.310 Jenny Duan: I'm rather weak. 318 00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:59.700 Jenny Duan: gauge their reaction. If they're supportive, they're like, Oh, that's great. If they're if they don't say much, then it's like, Okay, whatever. But if they're like oh, like great, then you know, the next time you can be like, Oh, Hi, I was wondering if you could write me a recommendation for this. 319 00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:14.569 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, I think like, teachers are quite understood like, that's their job, you know, to be supportive of students, right recommendations. And like, if they say No, it's it's not personal, just like it's fine. Chances are, they will say, yes, you know. 320 00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:26.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, that makes sense. Okay, cool. Number one thing. Make sure you go and bring them the cards on Monday and like flowers, is good, like, everyone likes 321 00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:34.739 huda: some type of small thing. Yeah, okay, Texan, if you have any questions, and we will talk soon. 322 00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.149 huda: Alright. Yeah, bye, bye.",

Well, how are you? 2 00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:34.290 Jenny Duan: I'm doing pretty good, too. I thought it would be good today to like for. Spend some time talking about like this issue with your counselor and your teachers, and then like what we can do to solve all this, all these things, because, like, it's gonna continue to be something like, you're always gonna need to ask for more recommendations like this is something that's gonna come up again and again. So did your teacher ever respond by the way, like any updates? 3 00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:48.200 huda: No, I've sent like, like, at least 5 like reminders by email like that, because it's kind of stressing. But yeah, I send like 5 emails. And like, he didn't reply. But 4 00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.269 huda: yeah, yeah, it's kind of frustrating. But 5 00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:04.570 huda: no, that's super super frustrating, did you? yeah. So he didn't end up submitting it in the portal. Yeah, I did email. And I haven't gotten an email back, either. So 6 00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.150 huda: II think I might try to like maybe forward my email to like another cause. I emailed it to 7 00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:24.639 huda: so there's like, if you have any questions based on admission email, this person but I think I could also like email, like the support team cause. There's like the head of admission, and there's also like the support team. 8 00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.399 huda: So II didn't like the head of omissions, but I think 9 00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.479 huda: I can forward it to them as well. 10 00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.620 Okay, that seems like a good idea to do 11 00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.710 Jenny Duan: And okay, so have you had issues with this teacher in the past? Or is this the first time that you've asked them? 12 00:02:42.960 --> 00:03:06.829 hud",
    "a: So? Yeah, I asked him for for the Bank of America still leaders one and that one, too. He was kinda like I had to like. I've been reminding him like for the past month for that one and he said he would, and then he just like kinda put it off to like the last week. But yeah, I did get like I eventually, that's the one that I got the Pdf for. But yeah. 13 00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.689 huda: good enough for this one. 14 00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:25.009 huda: Yeah. Like the Pdf that you submitted to. Jason. Oh, okay, I see. I just told him, like he could literally just like copy over like the one that he wrote for the other one cause I understand, like he's kind of busy because he's like. 15 00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:51.800 huda: well, okay, to be honest, he doesn't really have like that. Demanding overall cause. He's just like the media arts teacher. Which, like it's kind of like more like, a job kind of like. Course, we just have to produce like episodes each week. So it's not really like a teaching type, of course. But yeah, it's like, it's kind of frustrating. But yeah, like, I just told them like, Oh, you can just copy and paste for the other one, and that should be fine, but 16 00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.970 huda: I don't know 17 00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.770 Jenny Duan: how's your relationship with him otherwise. 18 00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:11.609 huda: I think I mean, I think that's pretty good, because I've been like working with him for like 2 2 years and he also saw me in like video production, and like, he said, like my documentary, is really good. And 19 00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:26.450 huda: yes, like also he's at the Hackathon advisor and we'd like once, like a few like field trips and stuff and user as well. So like, I've I'd feel like we have a pretty good relationship. But 20 00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.900 huda: I think he's just lazy. 21 00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:54.789 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but that's not a good thing. When your students like actually need you like, ",
    "I feel like as a teacher, that's your responsibility to be there for your students like when they ask, or if, like, the thing is, if you, I feel like, if you agree to something you need to follow through on it like if he said, No, I can't do this, then that's fine, like you just find another teacher. But if he agreed to it, and if you reminded of him for the past week. That's so unreasonable, in my opinion. 22 00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:13.099 huda: Yeah, I know, like my other teachers like I told them like a few weeks ago, and like. I've been reminding them as well, but they like at least like diligently like they just kind of submit on time. I think it might be just this teacher that like is kind of having this kind of issue. But with the other ones are, they're also kind of 23 00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:27.770 huda: They're they're kind of slacking with it, because I would ask them like at least 2 to 3 times for each one. So yeah, it's kind of they're kind of like finding it a bit annoying and inconvenient, I guess. But I mean, I just ask, anyway. 24 00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.640 Jenny Duan: Okay, well. 25 00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.090 Jenny Duan: I think, okay. 26 00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.060 Jenny Duan: let's see, do a lot of students ask them for letters of recommendation. Do you know, like, if this is a common thing that they've done in the past? 27 00:05:40.330 --> 00:06:02.519 huda: I think for my history teacher. She definitely like gets asked a lot, because, like I've had like a few like peers like asking class and everything. So I know, like she's kind of like she knows have the processes, and she kind of more diligent with that. But I'm not sure for him. I know he is like he used to be a Cs teacher. So like 28 00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.910 huda: I guess he doesn't. He only writes them for like one year actually applying to college, I think. 29 00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000 huda: But yeah, like, I don't think I've heard of anyone asking him for like some progra",
    "ms and everything. 30 00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's think through. Okay, let's get on your document. Let me open that up really quickly. 31 00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.289 Jenny Duan: and what I want us to do is let's make a list of all the teachers that you have. And let's like, like. 32 00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.410 Jenny Duan: kind of map out, like what you can ask them in the future and like pride about your relationship with them. Okay? 33 00:06:37.870 --> 00:07:03.679 Jenny Duan: So, starting from fresh of the year. 34 00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.090 Jenny Duan: do you have any good relationships with your teachers from freshman year? Still. 35 00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.679 huda: if not, that's okay, too. 36 00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.380 Okay 37 00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.319 Jenny Duan: was freshening during the pandemic, were you or were you in person? 38 00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:35.999 huda: I was in person? But that's like kind of when I first moved. So II didn't. Okay, there's only weird. But I don't. I don't really talk to anyone. But yeah. 39 00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.870 Jenny Duan: oh, yeah, that's not weird. That's fine. Okay, what about sophomore year. 40 00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:50.179 huda: Yeah. So I think I have a good relationship with. So my Cs teacher, she's still my Cs teacher, but her 41 00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.889 huda: and then I have like, I guess I have my English teacher, but I haven't talked to her in a while. 42 00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.020 huda: Like. 43 00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.539 Jenny Duan: hey? What's up? 44 00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:45.240 huda: Sorry. 45 00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.130 huda: No, I haven't. Okay, this is a good candidate. English teachers are usually good at writing letters of recommendation because they're good at writing. 46 00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.460 huda: So 47 00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.830 Jenny Duan: so let's keep her as a candidate. 48 00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.039 Jenny Duan: This teac",
    "her this year has supported you for the Nc. Whit. Right? 49 00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:14.960 huda: What else have you asked your for? So yeah, I've asked her for for cmu And she also got me the cte a word. It was like her recommendation. 50 00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:20.070 huda: and I think that's all. 51 00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.210 Jenny Duan: Okay. Can you write her up 52 00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.749 Jenny Duan: handwritten. Thank you. Card and breakers of flowers on Monday. 53 00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:42.259 Jenny Duan: Monday. Okay like this. Know? To do this Androgen card. Get her like flowers. Get one with a base, so she doesn't have to find a place to put it. So it's like either like a potted plant or like a flower with a base something like that. 54 00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.120 Jenny Duan: Thanks for supporting me or something, you know. 55 00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:56.270 huda: Yeah. Sophomore year. I also had my the same history teacher and the district teacher. You've asked her for what 56 00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:02.970 huda: I've asked her for. Noah Jane and Princeton. 57 00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.229 Jenny Duan: Okay, same thing on Monday. Get the flowers and the handwritten card. 58 00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.879 huda: if it's too much to carry to school on Monday, just face it like throughout the week, you know. 59 00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:20.089 Jenny Duan: like, go and get her some like flowers, a potted plan and write her handwritten card. 60 00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.899 Jenny Duan: okay, what? What other teachers did you have? 61 00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:34.959 huda: And I'm trying to think I did have. 62 00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.920 huda: I mean, I haven't talked to my chemistry teacher in a really long time. 63 00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:46.379 huda: I haven't seen him in a while as well, but we did have a pretty good relationship. I think. 64 00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:53.400 huda: he's like one time in Filmmakers Club. We had to like film in a classroom, and the",
    "n he let us use his classroom. But 65 00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.629 huda: Other than that, I don't think we've interacted since then. 66 00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.169 huda: He's also a good candidate. I let let's say, like. 67 00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.950 Jenny Duan: let's give your Cs teacher and your history teacher a break. And let's 68 00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:11.239 Jenny Duan: start using these new teachers. Okay, what other teachers do you have 69 00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.680 Jenny Duan: from sophomore year? 70 00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.690 huda: And 71 00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.180 huda: I'm trying to think like I have my Spanish teacher, and she's 72 00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:40.559 huda: Next year she's gonna be teaching like ap Spanish. So she's pretty nice. Again. I haven't really talked to her a lot. But yeah, she's like, really nice and think she's like really nice to all her students. But II think she'd be. 73 00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.169 huda: She could possibly write 74 00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.640 Jenny Duan: alright, that's good to know. And then any other teachers 75 00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:56.039 huda: like my, I have a math teacher, but like she's kind of not really like personal or 76 00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.879 huda: students. So she like, wouldn't really interact with them. 77 00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.510 huda: and 78 00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:10.730 Jenny Duan: I think that's all right. That's all my courses. Okay. And then this year. Remind me of all your teachers again. 79 00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.120 huda: So I have my calculus teacher. 80 00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.039 huda: hmm! Have they written you any, Rex? 81 00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:31.059 huda: No, but like my! I don't know if this applies to everyone. My friend asked her she could write a recommendation, and she said she only writes it, for, like the actual college application. 82 00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.970 Jenny Duan: Are you asking her for college? 83 00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:45.",
    "870 huda: No, I don't think she knows me that well, like I don't think she'd write a good letter recommendation, could, you? Doesn't really know? Like my skills and everything. 84 00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.789 Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. What other teachers 85 00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.720 huda: I have? 86 00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:57.730 huda: So I have, like my media arts teacher, who I've asked for Bank of America, and I'm using 87 00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.099 Jenny Duan: there's no more. 88 00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.090 Jenny Duan: I'm so like, I'm so sorry that happened like that is really frustrating. They still haven't. 89 00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.440 huda: Yeah. 90 00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:16.280 huda: yeah, and I have. I have that same history teacher from before 91 00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:21.680 huda: and then I have the same Cs teachers before 92 00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:29.329 huda: and then I have, yeah, I have, like an English teacher like an Ap line teacher. College, right? 93 00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.600 huda: Oh, yeah. She only runs for college. Yeah. 94 00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:40.240 huda: really selective about it. She's like, she said. She only writes 10 recommendations per year. But yeah. 95 00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:53.559 huda: okay, hopefully, you can get one. Did you raise your hand and talk in English fast. Yeah, sometimes I just go to like her. Like flex session to just like talk to her. So okay, seems like you're building up a good relationship. Then. 96 00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.429 huda: yeah. okay. And then I have. 97 00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:16.100 huda: So, well, my yoga teacher doesn't really know me. And then, yeah, cause we have to take like 2 years of PE and then in sophomore year, I wanted to take like media and computer science and Spanish. So I didn't have space for PE then. So yeah. 98 00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.000 huda: And then 99 00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.970 huda: I have my physics teacher. 100 00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.090 huda: ",
    "So again, he's kind of like 101 00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.220 huda: he's kind of not really personal, but 102 00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.480 huda: I mean, I think if I talk to him he could possibly write one. 103 00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.459 huda: Yeah, like, I don't like. I don't think I've ever like talked to him, or like, raise my hand in class. But 104 00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.770 Jenny Duan: Ok, you need to start raising your hand in class, and then maybe in like one month we can ask him for letters of recommendation. 105 00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.839 huda: yeah, that's all yeah. 106 00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:13.209 Jenny Duan: okay, so the teachers that we have as new candidates are the English user the cam teacher and the Spanish teacher from last year. So, okay, that's that's good to know and then your counselor, how's your Rec. How's your relationship with your counselors any better. I know you said your counselor got annoyed. But 107 00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:31.790 huda: it's bad like. I don't think we have a good relationship at all. She's like like when I walked in. She's like, Oh, your hooter right? And I was like, yeah, so it's kinda like she she like knew who I was. I felt like I think it was a negative connotation. 108 00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:52.190 Jenny Duan: Okay, go bring her some flowers in a card on Monday. This one is the first priority be like Hi, like just whenever you when you see her next time you in person, tell her, like, you know, that you've been asking for a lot. And like, you know how hard it is, and like, just like, really empathize with her and be like, Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. And like. 109 00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.079 Jenny Duan: because she's going to write, she's going to have to write some stuff for your college application 110 00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:06.520 Jenny Duan: like about you. Yeah. I did not know that they asked for a school report? And their counsel fills that out 111 00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:15.370 huda:",
    " it's not like that personal stuff, it's like more like, what Ca, Hu, what classes are you taking like stuff like that? 112 00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.799 huda: Okay. yeah, I'll try to like get her like a physical card, and maybe like a gift. 113 00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:43.010 huda: And like also like like last time. Also, when I came to our office, I was like, I was like, I'm really sorry, like, I know, this is kind of last minute and like, I'm really sorry, cause II know this is like really sudden but yeah, I really need this right now. But it's totally okay if you can't do it. But yeah, thank you. And she's still kind of mad. But 114 00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:54.299 Jenny Duan: okay, I think you need some practice like really being like super empathetic, and like trying to give her like a positive impression of you. Because I feel like 115 00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.169 Jenny Duan: you. You just need to like. 116 00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:02.120 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like like, act it. If you can't promote it like you need to act it like, really be like. 117 00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:16.399 Jenny Duan: find out what type of students do you know what type of student she likes? What's her character? Because I like definitely, teachers have like, sometimes they have like types of personalities that they like better or like they get along with better like, what do you think her personalities like? 118 00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:41.700 huda: Well, I think she just okay. So well, my friend, she has the same counselor and like her brother also is the same counselor, and so, like my friend will ask like academic questions, and she won't really be interested or reply, but, like her brother, kind of talks about more personal things and like. So she's like more interested in that. So I think maybe like if I open up to personally, maybe she'd be more interested. But 119 00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:42.890 huda: I'm not sure. 120 00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you can do that ",
    "like 121 00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:55.579 Jenny Duan: you can talk to her and be like, Thank you so much like you can like, open up about her like, be personal with like your life. You can be like, yeah, like, I don't really like. 122 00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:03.049 Jenny Duan: like, I'm finding out about opportunities last minute, like, I don't know that much about this college application process. It's like, really difficult, like 123 00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:13.659 Jenny Duan: being in this really stressful environment, can say, like, my parents like are both like got laid off. So I don't have these resources like, I am feeling like a lot of stress with my peers like you, just just like 124 00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:24.700 Jenny Duan: be like, open yourself up so that she feels like I don't know like more like pitting you, or is able to help you in that way, too. It's like a good strategy. But I think, like. 125 00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:35.820 Jenny Duan: I think you, yeah, you should try to improve your relationship with your counsellor, but I think, are you scared of her at all like, I guess, is there? How are other people's relationships with her, too. 126 00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:57.799 huda: To be honest, like anyone who like comes here for, like academic, like like changes to their transcript or like other academic help. I feel like they don't really have a great relationship with her, because everyone just kinda knows her as like the counselor that does nothing but like there's like other counselors which actually do things but 127 00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:09.150 huda: like like she just doesn't. But and then I'll also try like email the other counselors, because, like they, they're also available. And they just like kind of forward it to her. And she gets annoyed. And like. 128 00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:17.470 huda: yeah, so it's just kind of unfortunate. But if II did have a last name it would be better. But yeah, 129 00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.340 huda: yeah, I think, like",
    " 130 00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:29.069 huda: other people, they don't really have like a positive relationship with it, either. But I think that was like trying to like empathize with her as well would be more helpful. 131 00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.199 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think something I want you to do is 132 00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.709 Jenny Duan: Oh, actually, before I ask you about this, have you? Did you get an update from Nicholas at all. 133 00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.989 huda: He just kinda like ever since I sent the message. He just kinda like like 134 00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.270 huda: didn't read it. 135 00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.810 Jenny Duan: Oh, has. How long has it been. 136 00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.740 huda: It's been like 2, 3 days. 137 00:19:53.210 --> 00:20:02.559 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's fine. He's probably just like doing the terms and not checking it. Wait like a week. And then, if he doesn't respond, follow up. But what I wanted to do is, I want this week. I want you to 138 00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.479 Jenny Duan: cold message 10 people on Linkedin 139 00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:16.719 Jenny Duan: that you admire for whatever reason, and ask them to coffee. Chat with you. Ask them to set up a Zoom Meeting, and I want you to go and practice talking to people from all different backgrounds. This is your homework. 140 00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.199 Jenny Duan: Find 10 people, and like 141 00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:28.820 Jenny Duan: set up chats with them. They could be college students, they could be professionals. They could be other high school students. It doesn't matter. Just reach out to 10 strangers on Linkedin, because I think. 142 00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:41.639 Jenny Duan: like learning how to talk to adults and like, tell your story and explaining like who you are. What you're interested in is really really good practice. For, like learning, how different people react to situations and like knowing how to present yourself. 143 00:20:41.690 -->",
    " 00:20:42.710 Jenny Duan: So 144 00:20:43.030 --> 00:21:03.579 Jenny Duan: that's like one thing. Just reach out and confirm 10 calls. You don't necessarily need to call all the 10 people in one week, cause that's like a lot of calls, just 30 min conversations. But like, go find 10 people, reach out to them and like set up 10 calls within the next, like one to 3 weeks. I think that'll be really good practice for you. And then how's your relationship with your principal. 145 00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:16.719 huda: So I think. I think it's pretty good. So since that like situation with Notre Dame. Like my dad kind of like escalated a bit. But 146 00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:37.740 huda: like he did mention like my award and everything and so like, yeah, I think also, since I would soon use. We like interviewed him a few times, and like like he's like open up kind of person. He's like, oh, I used to go to this other school, and I see the principal there. So like, I think, relationships fine. I don't think like 147 00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.909 huda: we know, like I don't really know him that well and like I don't think he knows me that well. 148 00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:48.590 huda: So I wouldn't necessarily think that he'd be able to give a recommendation. 149 00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:56.420 Jenny Duan: Alright. Is there any way you could set up like office hours with your principal, or like, go and talk chat with him for like 30 min. Get to know him more. 150 00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:14.009 huda: I could. But okay, so the thing is like the the faculty at our school. I feel like they only like they only want like meetings, which I kind of have a purpose, you know. So like like when when you just like, go in to like talk about like 151 00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:21.250 huda: like casual things like like your life, or something like they wouldn't really be interested. So like 152 00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.620 huda: I don't know. Maybe I could like talk to him about and see wit, or somethi",
    "ng like that. 153 00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:36.549 Jenny Duan: Does your school have any like my school? My high school has, like social Justice Week. Does your school do any like assemblies, or anything focussed on like justice or advocacy? 154 00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:42.600 huda: well, we like one time we had like. 155 00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:50.239 huda: We just haven't kind of speakers come in but like, I don't really think we have anything about social justice. 156 00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:57.080 huda: Okay? Cause I was wondering, okay, do you guys have like assemblies or anything cause 157 00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.740 Jenny Duan: could you talk like. 158 00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.439 huda: do you guys have a student council at your school? Yeah. 159 00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:13.819 Jenny Duan: that is different from like, if, like, different person government like something that's a council that talks with like administration. And like, maybe parent teacher association. And like other schools. 160 00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:20.980 huda: I think it's just as B, yeah. 161 00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.460 Jenny Duan: maybe like 162 00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:37.600 Jenny Duan: you could talk to your, did your school have an AI use policy like AI usage? Chat? Gbt in class type of policy? I don't think it's explicitly set in like the rules or anything. 163 00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:46.250 Jenny Duan: Okay, maybe you can go talk to your principal about setting up in each attribute used policy, the highly used policy in school. 164 00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.879 huda: Oh, would that make you an OP. I think that would make me an OP. 165 00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.019 Jenny Duan: Okay. Okay? Cause I was thinking like. 166 00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:00.719 Jenny Duan: what is one way you can like like, what's. 167 00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.440 huda: oh, is it better or so? Yeah. 168 00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:10.320 Jenny Duan: maybe you could like, I think you should try to find opportunities to like ",
    "talk to him about like 169 00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:18.960 Jenny Duan: like what other things, that teachers would really care, like student, mental health. but like 170 00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.659 Jenny Duan: what your school can do to better accommodate student mental health 171 00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:38.830 Jenny Duan: like, does your school have any like mental health policy, plan anything, work with your counselors? You can like talk set up a meeting with the counselors, develop like student mental health, like plans, policy stuff like that. And you could also work with your principal to do that. 172 00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:55.489 huda: Yeah. I guess we have, like we have this thing called a wellness center, where, like you could just go in and like play like fidget toys and stuff. And and then there's like mental health events that they hold there. It's just like a little like area in the office. But yeah. 173 00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.919 Jenny Duan: can you lead a mental health event? 174 00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.489 huda: I think it's run by administration. 175 00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.820 Jenny Duan: Okay with the counselors. How many counselors are there? And is there like 176 00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.400 Jenny Duan: someone working like at front desk at the counselor's office. 177 00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:24.720 huda: Yeah. So I believe there's like 4 or 5 councillors. And yeah, there is someone at the Counselors office in the front desk. Okay. How close are you with this front desk? Person? 178 00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:30.459 huda: Not at all. I'd like to talk to them once bear to know this front desk person really? Well. 179 00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:51.699 Jenny Duan: be, have them be like, feel like buddies with the front desk person. This is like a good strategy, because, like they will, they will help you a lot, too, if, like, they can help you. If you're friends with this front desk person, they can help you like, get time on the counselors, calendars ",
    "they can help you like with a lot of stuff. So does the front desk person help schedule meetings, or like, what is their what is their job? 180 00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:57.970 huda: Their job is just like kind of filing papers. If you wanna schedule a meeting like 181 00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:05.990 huda: there's like an online form that you have to fill out. And then they like, pull you out of class and like, talk to you about it. But yeah. 182 00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.810 Jenny Duan: but does the front desperate? Do not schedule the meetings? 183 00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.920 huda: Oh, no. 184 00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:32.050 huda: okay. It's okay. I think if your friend 185 00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:54.079 huda: so yeah, I think like they kind of like help with the paperwork for the counselors, because the counselors like have a lot of people work with transcripts and stuff like that. But I don't think they're in charge. There's like another person in charge of like the Wellness center, like mental health events. And like, yeah, she's pretty nice. But yeah, I go in there a few times. 186 00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.930 Do you know her? Well, because I think it'd be good to get to know her a lot. 187 00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:05.519 huda: Not exactly like, I think, like I've been like, recently, I've been going into the wellness center quite a bit. But yeah. 188 00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.520 Jenny Duan: okay, let's see 189 00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:14.679 Jenny Duan: sounds like. So all of these people who like you, might not directly interface with 190 00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:28.229 Jenny Duan: 1 s, they are really important for you to get to know and try to establish good relationships with them, too, because they have the power to like, connect you with, like your counselor, your principal, and also like 191 00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:37.349 Jenny Duan: kind of give you more resources, too. So I think I would try to develop a good relationship with them as well. And just the princip",
    "le have like 192 00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:42.850 Jenny Duan: that associate, or like secretary, or someone who like schedules their meetings for them. 193 00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:51.980 huda: I think there's like there's advice principles. I'm not sure if that's what they're chart in charge of. 194 00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.360 huda: But 195 00:27:54.590 --> 00:28:00.689 huda: yeah, I mean, like, I could probably like like talk to him like personally, just to like book a meeting, maybe. 196 00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:05.040 huda: But yeah, it's probably more like like personally asking. 197 00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.390 Jenny Duan: What are your vice principals in charge of? 198 00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:27.070 huda: I'm not totally clear cause I know some of them like there's like 3 vice principals, and so like one like facilitated like the cte award. And then, like they kind of make sure like campuses fine and like they just like kind of like, walk around during lunch. 199 00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.840 huda: And 200 00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.440 huda: I guess they're also like help with the security. 201 00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.289 huda: I don't exactly know like what their job is like behind, like like 202 00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:49.049 huda: like what their job is like for the school outside of, you know. Just like checking to make sure, like, the kids aren't skipping class and stuff. But yeah, this kind of 203 00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.489 huda: what I see them doing most of the time. 204 00:28:52.240 --> 00:29:14.629 Jenny Duan: I think if you can get into a close relationship with your vice principals as well, that could also be really good, because I think, like they might be slightly less busy than a principal, but still have, like a lot of power as school administrators, and they would be able to write you letters of a recommendation, too, and like support you in different ways. So I think, try to get into a good relationship with them as well if you can. 205 00:29",
    ":14.760 --> 00:29:37.359 huda: Yeah, I think so. I'm sorry. One of my vice principals. She's like also like a South Asian woman, and she also like she's one of the people that handed me the award for the cte thing like. So I think that's pretty cool, and then also like my past experience with her is like she see me like applying to like 206 00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:55.279 huda: last year before I kind of like before, kind of knew about my summer programs. Like, actually, I was like appliance like a Berkeley summer program and she saw me, and she's like, Oh, you know, I used to go to Berkeley. That's really cool that you're applying. So I think she'd be like supportable, like writing recommendations and stuff. 207 00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:08.580 huda: Oh, if if she from California, if she went to Berkeley. Then she definitely understands like grind, you know. So I could like start being more like. 208 00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:22.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, it's really, I think if you can go in with a mission. It's good like you should set up a time with her. But don't try to waste your time like. Don't just feel like, oh, I just want to chat about life. You can. You can still chat about life. But it's good to have like 209 00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:31.639 Jenny Duan: a topic like, Go in and say, like, okay, I wanna talk about how our school can better improve our mental health plan and how our school can 210 00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.540 Jenny Duan: increased school spirit, how our school can like 211 00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:39.040 Jenny Duan: raise more money for like a football team like I don't know whatever you 212 00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:48.170 Jenny Duan: think it. Do you have any ideas like, I think if you schedule some time with her and talk about like some specific issue that you would like to talk about. I think she'd be receptive to that. 213 00:30:49.810 --> 00:31:05.199 huda: I could probably talk about okay, well, I can't really think of anything right now. Maybe ",
    "214 00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:26.009 Jenny Duan: if you like, developing like a responsible technology use plan is like, kind of cool, but I don't know like that might make you an OP. But it like no, I think I don't know cause at Stanford, like a lot of professors allow students to use AI like at their disposal. 215 00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:39.680 huda: But I think it's like chat, like other AI. Tools are blocked from our Wi-fi. Well, like there's nothing like explicitly saying analogies wi-fi, but like, it's like blocked from every device. 216 00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.370 huda: So action. 217 00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.950 huda: Maybe 218 00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.100 Jenny Duan: if you could improve one thing about your high school, what would it be? 219 00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.739 huda: Music? A lot 220 00:31:53.090 --> 00:32:02.179 huda: like. Say, cause there's like people like doing drugs in class at my school and 221 00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:19.500 huda: like, I think, school spirit in general, like in our schools, like really bad, like, no one really likes your school and like, it's the thing the thing is like we've been trying to like, improve that with like student use. But like no one watches student use either. So 222 00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:46.140 huda: oh, okay, wait. I have an idea. So in advisory. We have, like our like advisory classes. Every Thursday we have this thing called like so to grow, and with like talk about our feelings, or whatever and like no one really does it. But like, maybe if we could find if I could think of like a better solution to some to grow and like, ask her if we could implement that. And maybe that could be a good idea. 223 00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.179 Yeah, I mean, improving school sphere is a really 224 00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:54.830 Jenny Duan: important thing, and so is like. how do we ensure that? Students like. 225 00:32:54.950 --> 00:33:03.859 Jenny Duan: how do we decrease absenteeism and like decrease drug usage in scho",
    "ols like that's also something you can think about like how to how to tackle 226 00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.830 huda: do you have any ideas about like 227 00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.999 Jenny Duan: how you would approach these things. 228 00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:31.970 huda: Oh, yeah, sorry. I forgot to mention before like this. Some to grow thing was kind of like a like a mental health check in so like they're supposed to talk about like, oh, how's your week today? How? How would you overcome this struggle? And stuff like that? But it's still kind of like, really sap. Consider sappy and like, people don't really do it. So maybe, like. 229 00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:41.760 huda: I could probably research into like another website that we can integrate into our school or like another convenient way, like an app or something. But 230 00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.150 huda: yeah. 231 00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.260 Jenny Duan: do you guys have a mental health awareness club, or like a mental health club. 232 00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:56.749 huda: We probably do like we have a one called Melodies for Anxiety, where, like it shows like how like 233 00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:05.039 huda: anxiety could be reduced with like music and stuff. But yeah, I don't think there's one for just mental health. 234 00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.550 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 235 00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:15.229 Jenny Duan: okay. When I was in high school. I started a Mental Health Awareness Club, and that was like something that I was really passionate about and did like a lot of work in. 236 00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:26.609 Jenny Duan: But like. Maybe if you could bring that up with, you know your or something like to do something. That's also how I kind of got close to like my counselor, and like my principal, too, is because, like 237 00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:36.179 Jenny Duan: mental health is something that, like, you know, counselors care about like principles, care about stuff like that. So I think that's like a pretty",
    " interesting way to get into that or like. 238 00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.110 Jenny Duan: if you could like. 239 00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.650 Jenny Duan: how specifically would you change the so to grow program. 240 00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:58.880 huda: I'm probably so like a lot of like the main reason why people don't use this because they have to pull out their chromebooks, and then they have to go into the like kind of wait for it to connect to the Wi-fi and everything. So I think, finding like an alternative app which is like, kind of. 241 00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:22.420 huda: okay, this is kind of like bias, but like more gamified, I guess. Like a more interesting way rather than just like writing down your feelings and like like, it just takes a really long time. So there, it'll probably be something like more simple. And I'm sure there's like there's definitely like apps out there that like are that are quicker and like more fun for the kids. But 242 00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:31.379 huda: yeah, that's how I would improve it. But I think I think I'll look into like specific apps that we can use. 243 00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.550 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 244 00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.050 Jenny Duan: Wonder 245 00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.730 Jenny Duan: is. 246 00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:58.290 Jenny Duan: I don't know if your school could host like Another thing that my high school did was like we had a like a social justice like Day, where, like a bunch of speakers and people came in to like talk about experience with like different social justice issues like that's another. 247 00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.949 Jenny Duan: I think. Interesting opportunity that maybe you could start 248 00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:06.849 Jenny Duan: at your school, too. But like any type of like big. 249 00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.199 Jenny Duan: I guess types of 250 00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.680 Jenny Duan: projects that you can 251 00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:18.410 Jenny Duan: start. Your school coul",
    "d be like good ways to connect with your counselors and teachers. 252 00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:36.150 Jenny Duan: So like a mental health awareness, something like this. So to grow or starting like a social justice awareness, like Speaker series day, like some type of things to show your leadership at your school, I think, could be really really powerful or like, if you could give your advice on how to restructure. Maybe, like 253 00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:45.849 Jenny Duan: I don't know some part of the the health curriculum, or something like that, too, like drug in terms of like drug mitigation, or I don't know something like that. 254 00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.919 Jenny Duan: because I think the drug issue is also like something that 255 00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.470 Jenny Duan: you know is tied along with mental health. And like also the school spirit. 256 00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.610 huda: Yeah, why do you feel like school spirit at your school is an issue? 257 00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:08.269 huda: Sorry. My, I think it's I think my Internet's kind of bad. 258 00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:13.669 Jenny Duan: I said, why do you feel like spirit at your school? Is an issue like, what do you think is the root cause of that. 259 00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:37.119 huda: I guess, like. The only way to explain is that everyone kind of thinks it's like cringe. So like like leadership students, they kind of have to like deck all out for, like the spare weeks and stuff like that. And then, like their student use. And we have, like all these ways to improve improve student culture. 260 00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:47.199 huda: but like a lot of there's like the whole thing where everyone's like, oh, that's so embarrassing. And like it's kind of irritating because everyone's just trying to have fun. But 261 00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.060 huda: I think. like another part of it is because it's 262 00:37:53.830 --> 00:38:06.340 huda: kind of not cater to everyone, cause like, it's like the humor tha",
    "t we use in zoom using stuff. It. It might just not be like people will understand it. I'm just like building a specific culture. 263 00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:12.940 huda: It's kind of tough. And there's like, not a lot of reason behind it. It's just that it's cringe. So 264 00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:13.930 huda: yeah. 265 00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:23.319 Jenny Duan: how do we make cringe into cool? That's like, that's a hard yeah, that's a hard issue. And I think it's like a lot of people are 266 00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:29.160 Jenny Duan: scared, or maybe don't feel comfortable, but like. I guess. 267 00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:44.109 Jenny Duan: how do you tackle that? Do I think something that my student use account did is made a Tiktok account, and they would like interview our teachers and like, make funny videos with like our administration like, think that actually got a lot of attention. And people really like that. 268 00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:51.249 Jenny Duan: So that's not good. That's a good idea. I think, for school morale. 269 00:38:52.830 --> 00:39:05.969 Jenny Duan: So some things that some other things at my school that like system we're out. These are not necessarily things that you'd need to in implement, just like some ideas we have, like a student teacher like basketball tournament. We're like the teachers, so like 270 00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.090 Jenny Duan: for one assembly, and they were like 271 00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:13.799 Jenny Duan: like our gym. That's the huge thing. For some reason, like 272 00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.679 Jenny Duan: What else do we do. 273 00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:32.639 huda: I think deal with the tech talks is really good cause. That way, like, maybe like, I could build my relationships with certain teachers as well like, and the counselor and vice principals and everything cause. Maybe we could like. 274 00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:50.650 huda: like, you know how. So we go on around like interviewing the students and almost student ne",
    "eds to show like every Thursday. But like, I think, if we have like on Instagram, like, we try to upload like interviews with like faculty. That'd be good. So like I could probably like 275 00:39:50.660 --> 00:40:08.370 huda: like interview like after everything's kind of cool down and like settle them account, so I could try to interview her and like the vice principal, maybe, like our principal, and like other faculty members, I think that's a really good idea actually, and then does your school have, like any type of 276 00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.509 Jenny Duan: random acts of kindness? Club? 277 00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:21.360 huda: I think sometimes they have random acts of kindness. as like a spirit like activity, spirit, day activity. 278 00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.690 Jenny Duan: I wonder if your school could start like, 279 00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.230 Jenny Duan: maybe like a 280 00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.760 Jenny Duan: hmm. 281 00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.310 Jenny Duan: like, okay. 282 00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:52.219 Jenny Duan: I think if you wanted to do something for mental health awareness month at your school. There's a lot you can do for mental health awareness. Month like mental health awareness. Month is in May, so it's not too late to like plan and do something in May. It's not too late to like coordinate like a pretty widespread campaign for your school like. I think it'd be a very powerful thing if 283 00:40:52.220 --> 00:41:07.409 Jenny Duan: if you could figure out how to do like some sort of mental health awareness month like celebration, like day of awareness. Something like that, like something that I did at my school that was like really simple, was just ordered a bunch of green ribbons, which is a symbol of like mental health awareness, and just like 284 00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.309 Jenny Duan: literally, how people wear them for like one day 285 00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:15.470 Jenny Duan: and office. And that's like a pretty powerful thing. ",
    "I think you can do to like. 286 00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:16.940 Jenny Duan: you know. 287 00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:39.420 Jenny Duan: or like have, like an anonymous message for that, like how people share their experiences with like different mental health issues. To show people that they're not alone like or like writing kind letters. To like strangers is is one thing like, I think if you search of like mental health awareness month, like school activities, you can probably come up with like a lot of different things, you know. So I feel like, if you did like. 288 00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.440 Jenny Duan: or even if you did, did your school have like a daily announcements, or Daily News, or something like that 289 00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:49.079 Jenny Duan: if you could do like one mental health strategy in the Daily Newsletter every single day 290 00:41:49.170 --> 00:42:05.350 Jenny Duan: during the month of May like that, could also, like small things like that have really big impacts and like it will show your leadership, and it will help you to build your relationship with your principal and your counselor to. If you want to do something like that, I think that could be a good idea. 291 00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.790 huda: Yeah. yeah, I think 292 00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:20.449 huda: so there's like 2 people from leadership that do like the daily announcements. So I could. So there are like forms where you can get something announced, and then maybe like 293 00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:26.270 huda: cause, I know, for like black black 294 00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.589 huda: history month. History month. Yeah. 295 00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:45.729 huda: They did like every single day. They're like talking about one like important like black historical figure. And I think that's really cool. And like, I actually did learn a lot from that. So maybe we could do something similar with mental health awareness. Month. 296 00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:50.960 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I definitely thi",
    "nk so. And I think instead of submitting the form, you should go and 297 00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.430 Jenny Duan: talk to them one on one like, Are you friends with these people? 298 00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:03.180 huda: No, but II do like I have like talked to them in the past. I could probably like talk to them again. 299 00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.379 Jenny Duan: Hmm, okay. I think you should go and do that 300 00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.829 Jenny Duan: like. Go 301 00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:22.809 Jenny Duan: talk to them, be friends with them, and like, mention it in person and like frame that as like a collaboration with them, does that make sense be like, Oh, we wanna like collaborate or like, launch this together 302 00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:26.530 huda: and then do that. Okay, yeah. 303 00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.570 Jenny Duan: And then also, like. 304 00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.570 Jenny Duan: are they are, are these people like popular kids? Or are they like normal? 305 00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.190 Oh, that makes sense. 306 00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:46.340 huda: Okay. So one of them are popular. Kit is a popular kid, and then the other one's just kinda like, I think, like my friends are friends with them. So oh, yeah. 307 00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.619 Jenny Duan: okay, I think you should try to start like 308 00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:59.279 Jenny Duan: being friends with popular people like like, Don't, okay, don't be mean, but I think it's good to like as a student, to be someone who's generally like. 309 00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:27.759 Jenny Duan: well liked or well regarded like you don't have to be like in the popular group. But like, try to branch outside your like circle and try to like talk to people from different groups, more and more, because I think, like teachers will recognize that to you and like, if students speak positively about you, and everyone's like, Oh, who does like really cool like? Who does super nice like that also reflects well on you, because",
    " it'll allow you like more collaboration opportunities with other students from different organizations and things like that the people who will support you if you start a club or 310 00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.420 huda: and something else, you know. 311 00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.520 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 312 00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:41.049 Jenny Duan: yeah. Do you have any other questions about like 313 00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:56.949 huda: how to improve your relationship with your teachers and you. And we could spend more time on this, too, next week, too. Yeah. So you know how those teachers I haven't really talked to this year, but like they were nice, and we had a great relationship last year. How do I kind of go about like 314 00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:08.400 huda: kind of talking to them again, and then like slowly working my way up to like, ask them, asking them for recommendation. So I don't want them to think that I'm only talking to them because of the recommendation. But like. 315 00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:28.080 Jenny Duan: yeah, stop from their office like for their classroom like during your flex or during that period. And then also after school, just to Hi, just want to see how your like years going wanted to see, we can catch up and then talk to them. They have office hours. Just go to the office hours, talk to them, and you can mention like, oh, like, you know, this has been, it's been really busy, like 316 00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:43.400 Jenny Duan: I've been trying to like, explore my interests in like computer science. I've been trying to get deeper in this. But like, so I'm applying to a ton of programs. But it's been challenging, just mentioned that you're like, plant the seed in their brain that you're applying programs. And then, like, the next time you see them. And like. 317 00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.310 Jenny Duan: I'm rather weak. 318 00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:59.700 Jenny Duan: gauge their reaction. If they're supportive, they're like, Oh, that's gr",
    "eat. If they're if they don't say much, then it's like, Okay, whatever. But if they're like oh, like great, then you know, the next time you can be like, Oh, Hi, I was wondering if you could write me a recommendation for this. 319 00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:14.569 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, I think like, teachers are quite understood like, that's their job, you know, to be supportive of students, right recommendations. And like, if they say No, it's it's not personal, just like it's fine. Chances are, they will say, yes, you know. 320 00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:26.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, that makes sense. Okay, cool. Number one thing. Make sure you go and bring them the cards on Monday and like flowers, is good, like, everyone likes 321 00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:34.739 huda: some type of small thing. Yeah, okay, Texan, if you have any questions, and we will talk soon. 322 00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.149 huda: Alright. Yeah, bye, bye."
