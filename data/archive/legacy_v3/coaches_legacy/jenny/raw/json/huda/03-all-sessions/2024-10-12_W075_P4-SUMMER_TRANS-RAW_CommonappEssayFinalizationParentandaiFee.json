I like your hair. 3 00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.056 Jenny Duan: Oh, thank you. I went back to black or dark hair today. 4 00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:35.190 Jenny Duan: All right, let's just get started. I don't know. We have limited time today, so maybe we could just get started with your dad's review of your common app. Hi, Siraj. 5 00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.060 Siraj Nazir: Hey? How's it going, Jenny? 6 00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.926 Jenny Duan: Doing pretty well. How are you? I saw your feedback, for who does essays like I saw the document so maybe we could start with that 7 00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.459 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I want to do that. In fact, actually, Huda is actually incorporated. And I'll I promise I'll leave like in 5 min. 8 00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:00.160 Siraj Nazir: What I wanted to do was because I think Hudab ha wanted me to join, because, she said, it's like I'm done with this. So if you want to make anything happen now is the time 9 00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.870 Siraj Nazir: which I can understand. Just give me one sec. 10 00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.949 Siraj Nazir: Can you share it? I mean, you know, I'm just setting up my new 11 00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.989 Siraj Nazir: Mac. Actually, everything is like everything needs to be set up. So if you can. 12 00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.659 huda: I've put it in the chat. 13 00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:26.940 Siraj Nazir: Great. I think fundamentally 2 points. Okay, Jenny. And I, I, you know. And I think it's it's really, like, you know, based on all the other essays and and you see, like, independently 14 00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:37.900 Siraj Nazir: it's the same kind of database that I pinged into. But I I use Claudia. And then I also use open AI, and it's pretty much the same thing, right? So 15 00:01:39.288 --> 00:01:45.929 Siraj Nazir: there are areas where I feel there is a lot of thought leadership in the second part, especially 16 00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.260 Siraj Nazir: right where she's making basically statements around, you know, like, you know. 17 00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.569 Siraj Nazir: stats. And then, you know, hey, this is what people think people feel this and that. I think we need to personalize it a bit more 18 00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.030 Siraj Nazir: and 19 00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:07.470 Siraj Nazir: and I think, there isn't like per se. I would say like at least like challenge. You know, a few challenges, or at least one challenge that that's kind of 20 00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:11.566 Siraj Nazir: there, I think Huda's done a good job. She's actually brought up 21 00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:31.420 Siraj Nazir: so personalization, adding in at least some challenge on how she basically went through the experience like telling you know that those points through her experience versus just you know, making some statements and claim, that's 1. Yeah, I think, apart from that. It's it's it's it's all good. 22 00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:49.509 Siraj Nazir: And I think Huda is going to walk you through. I think what she's come up with, you know, and like this is precisely what I've always seen synthoria, as you know, I know that there's AI, there's data, science and all that, but really like, for the most creative part of synthoria. Game was always like Huda being able to come up with the characters right, Sana and Yasmin 23 00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:55.379 Siraj Nazir: that that was the most creative part that that really wowed. Many people right who have seen that game. 24 00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:09.890 Siraj Nazir: And I think in some ways the second part is about that diversity, lack of diversity and inclusion in gaming. I feel that should be really the highlight, and I think Huda has done a good job there. I think AI data. Science and education probably is not the real theme of this essay. 25 00:03:10.498 --> 00:03:12.729 Siraj Nazir: What we need to do probably, is 26 00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:15.395 Siraj Nazir: have that as 27 00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.279 Siraj Nazir: yeah, might be Huda. I I'll just listen in. And then, you know I 1st tell me like, what do you feel about the the feedback 28 00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:30.259 Siraj Nazir: that we have got. You know, when I ran Huda's essay through, you know the other kind of 200 plus essays. 29 00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.320 Jenny Duan: Are you asking me? Or Hudo. 30 00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.780 Siraj Nazir: Sorry. 31 00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.140 huda: Are you- are you. 32 00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.410 Jenny Duan: Are you asking me, or. 33 00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.029 Siraj Nazir: I'm asking you, Jenny, like I mean, I think I'm kind of convinced, because, you know 34 00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.240 Siraj Nazir: I think I've I've kind of ran a few more essays and stuff like that. I've read, you know, again, like I wanted to make sure that you know I'm not giving like a wrong advice. 35 00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.930 Siraj Nazir: I think there are certain areas. Yeah. 36 00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:04.490 Jenny Duan: I think, maybe 37 00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:15.270 Jenny Duan: here, I feel like we don't. We don't, I think this, I think this statement is fine, I think I don't really see any problem with this. 38 00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.140 Jenny Duan: I think 39 00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.510 Jenny Duan: this, maybe. 40 00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:25.370 Jenny Duan: Yes, we could be more specific here, I agree. But I also think, like 41 00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:36.200 Jenny Duan: this essay is quite. It's only 650 words. So there's like a limited amount of specificity that we can get to but for. But I think here is maybe one place. We could be more specific. 42 00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.410 Siraj Nazir: Exactly. 43 00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.249 Jenny Duan: I think I don't know if we need to write about too many challenges here, because I just don't know if we have space 44 00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:56.640 Jenny Duan: But I think that it does like this essay does good. Do a good job of like talking about challenges in general, like here, I feel like this is a good discussion of challenges, and like how she's overcome. 45 00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.530 Jenny Duan: So I don't know. Necessarily, if we. 46 00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:12.179 Siraj Nazir: You guys have spent more time in it, I think again, even the last point, if you see 5 right? It was not really about simplifying like, I mean again, they they talk about specific example, right? Of how the games. I think it's more the experience like 47 00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:21.450 Siraj Nazir: framing it as a way of experience versus like talking about diversity and inclusion like, without like, without without experiencing anything about it like. So that's like out of the pool. 48 00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.860 Siraj Nazir: right? It's out of the blue that who does talking about diversity and inclusion in games like. So I think that is, that is a gap that who does actually filled. And 49 00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:49.579 Siraj Nazir: it it's precisely why Hula actually added those characters. So it was really a self, you know, introspection and reflection. And and I think let's get going. I think I'm gonna go on mute. I will just see like who the you know. Read her, just help her, you know, finalize and edit. I I'm personally very, very happy with that. But again, it's entirely up to you guys if you feel like it's not coming along. Well. 50 00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.069 Siraj Nazir: then, that's fine, too. So. 51 00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:11.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, totally. I think. 1st of all, like, I'm curious, like, what are your thoughts? In my opinion, I think like this does give good feedback, and but I think, like maybe not everything. But it does give some good points. But I'm curious, like, how do you feel about your essay as it currently is, and like what what you've your takeaway from this feedback is. 52 00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:25.129 huda: Yeah, I actually had a chat with my dad about this about this feedback, and then like, I agree that some statements like the oversimplifying complex topics. That one is a bit like 53 00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:55.402 huda: like, I feel like we explained it pretty well in the essay. But yeah, I also definitely feel like the overcoming adversity might not have been clear. And I think, like you mentioned also, like the the trope that I kind of like had in my story, like the one where I'm like deciding if I want to name son or Yasmin, or actually ava, and that's like a really common trope of like, I think you said it was like the lunchbox story. But yeah. So then I actually 54 00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:11.004 huda: took these took this like advice and kind of put it in another iteration. So in like the draft document. I think if you see on like the left side, it says iteration one. And I added, like, so most of it's the same. But 55 00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:20.188 huda: right here. I added, like a new kind of like turn, like twist to it. So right after I say, 56 00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:34.569 huda: who am I when not bound to one narrative, one language or one rule? And this is when I'm after I talked about like learning problem solving from video games. And then I talk about how video games help me like, learn how to like rule switch 57 00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:58.529 huda: and then, so I start this new part and says, and yet, behind all the role switching and analytic skills I gained, there was one thing I had lost from from games my individuality. One evening, while playing assassin's creed, I spotted a woman, brown skinned, with surma in her eyes like me, hidden in the background, selling fruit at a market stall, a mere blur in the scenery. 58 00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.439 huda: Characters who looked like me were always the ones I passed by, nameless and insignificant. 59 00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:18.064 huda: So I guess I'm kind of like giving like a little bit of a an anecdote about like why I like when I realized that, like diversity, is an issue with like people that look like me. And then I continue on to say, 60 00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:38.599 huda: like this is, I guess, like my introspection, and I'm saying it struck me that, like the woman in the bazaar, I, too, am the supporting character, always stepping into the shoes of gladiators, detectives, Nba all-stars, but never wearing my own. I had learned to thrive in the roles. Games provided me, but now, I ask myself, can games thrive in the roles I provide them. 61 00:08:38.900 --> 00:09:03.809 huda: And so this like next part, I tried developing, but I don't think it's fully developed yet. But, I said, developing my game synthoria. I dragged myself to the forefront. The protagonists, Sana and Yasmin were behind a fruit weren't behind a fruit stall at the bazaar instead, they were fighting AI bias, reprogramming rogue robots, and in the face of technological innovation the protagonists are no longer nameless. Instead, they have loud Muslim names. 62 00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:18.500 huda: games, asks us to become someone else. All the time I've played as a detective raccoon in an Nba all-star, and now I invite the Yasmin and Sennas of the world to see that they can also be in the forefront of innovation. 63 00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:22.910 huda: And then, like this next part, I haven't updated it so like matches. 64 00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:32.809 huda: it doesn't match with this new iteration, because I kind of just started working on it. But yeah, like, I think I can like fix this so it has to do with this one as well. 65 00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.880 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I actually think this is really, really good. 66 00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.829 Jenny Duan: I think that this last. 67 00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:46.009 Siraj Nazir: I was actually watching your expression, Jenny. I think I think even if you said otherwise, you know, I would have caught you there. 68 00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:52.259 Siraj Nazir: I think there was an instant reaction. I think the way you know, it's also very authentic. That's what I love, because this is her story. 69 00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.990 Siraj Nazir: I don't want anything to be cooked up because she doesn't have to cook up anything. Honestly, it's such a thanks. 70 00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is so good. Yeah. I deleted this paragraph because I just felt like it was repetitive. And I don't think that you need this. 71 00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.340 Jenny Duan: But 72 00:10:07.892 --> 00:10:10.790 Jenny Duan: I think like this is enough of a transition. 73 00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:21.260 huda: Actually with that paragraph I was wondering, cause, like the part where it says that, like I relate myself with, like the woman in the bazaar. 74 00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.939 Jenny Duan: I think, cause you say, like me, I think that's enough of a signal. 75 00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.420 huda: Okay. 76 00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:45.040 huda: do you think this is enough like intro to like like the problem that I wanted to fix or actually, I kind of really like the last sentence of the paragraph, and that like was deleted cause. It's like directly leading to the next paragraph. I think. 77 00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.620 huda: Yeah. 78 00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.499 Siraj Nazir: I think the one that yeah, I mean again, I I have a view just like on that. It's like. 79 00:10:53.510 --> 00:11:00.190 Siraj Nazir: really the fact that you know. You know, might be assassin creed, and you know, brown skin. Probably you don't need that. 80 00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:08.150 Siraj Nazir: I think. But that she walked past someone like her all the time. I think that's kind of that sets the context right like. 81 00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:16.730 Siraj Nazir: So I don't know how you frame it might be. We have to probably reduce. I do agree. There's a lot of you don't have to tell that, you know, like me. Then again, brown skinned, I think. 82 00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:24.890 Siraj Nazir: So I think we can probably compress that. But I don't know if, Jenny, you had some other like. Why do you felt that it was kind of a redundant product. 83 00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:31.841 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean gladiators and Nba detect detectives. Nba, all stars you like already mentioned that. 84 00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:42.079 Jenny Duan: Later, when you're saying like how you played as a detective raccoon and be all star. I think it's fine if you leave it there. And also like, I think this is just. 85 00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.550 Jenny Duan: I don't want. I don't want you to say that you are the supporting character, because I feel like that's 86 00:11:47.610 --> 00:12:09.770 Jenny Duan: like that. Doesn't that like diminishes you because it doesn't show that, like you are becoming by saying, like you are the supporting character. It's not like you were the supporting character. It's like this is how you are in your current state. And since, like, we're using this as an analogy to show growth, we don't want to typify that you are the supporting character right now, we want to say like, Oh, you can make 87 00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:17.570 Jenny Duan: like you maybe used to be more shy. But like, since developing these different platforms like you've grown in these ways, and so I don't want to say that, like you are 88 00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:22.700 Jenny Duan: like the woman in the bazaar, and you are the sporting character in this moment? Does that make sense. 89 00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.720 huda: Yeah. 90 00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.449 Jenny Duan: Okay? So that's why I think like this is enough of a transition. 91 00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.790 Jenny Duan: I like this sentence. 92 00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.320 Jenny Duan: the protagonists 93 00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.890 Jenny Duan: and yes, the protagonist 94 00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:41.420 Jenny Duan: aren't. And I think this is like, maybe too much repetition. Here. We don't need this context. 95 00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.030 Jenny Duan: Maybe 96 00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:50.689 Jenny Duan: maybe instead of saying this, you can like paraphrase it in another way, like maybe they're not. 97 00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:58.199 Jenny Duan: I don't know merely like background characters, or like they're not merely like scenery, or they're not merely like 98 00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.119 Jenny Duan: decoration, or 99 00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.629 Jenny Duan: like they're not. 100 00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.260 huda: Blurs in the background. 101 00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.519 Jenny Duan: I think you already say blurs in the back like you say hidden 102 00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.660 Jenny Duan: here. 103 00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:14.789 Jenny Duan: I think maybe another thing that you can touch on is like 104 00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.770 Jenny Duan: how 105 00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:27.229 Jenny Duan: maybe, like women of color, or just like people of color, often like uses, like decoration or commodification in like games or shows like, it's like like forced representation. 106 00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.170 Jenny Duan: If you know what I mean, where it like feels unnatural. But just because the game makers like were 107 00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.590 Jenny Duan: TV producers want to have someone, but 108 00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:41.594 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that is that applicable here. But that is another issue. We're talking to Sona and Yasmeen, aren't 109 00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.239 Jenny Duan: I don't know, like decoration, or I don't. I don't know what the best. 110 00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.970 Siraj Nazir: In other words, they're not the main lead, you know. That's what it is. I mean. So. 111 00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.440 Jenny Duan: Come out of right. 112 00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.230 Siraj Nazir: So. 113 00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.379 Jenny Duan: That's good, Huda. 114 00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.969 Jenny Duan: and could modify 115 00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.420 Jenny Duan: and said, they are fighting AI bias, reprogramming group of. 116 00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.500 Jenny Duan: and 117 00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.749 Jenny Duan: maybe, instead of in the face, you can see like 118 00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.450 Jenny Duan: leading technological innovation or something. 119 00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.150 huda: Hmm. 120 00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:24.230 Jenny Duan: Is in the face implies that, like technological innovation is something that's done to them rather than something that they're individually pursuing. 121 00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.880 Jenny Duan: this is great. 122 00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.710 Jenny Duan: This is great. 123 00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.860 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is a repetition of this. 124 00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.729 Jenny Duan: So can we write this in a different way. 125 00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.680 huda: Yeah, so. 126 00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.819 Jenny Duan: Change. Another word for synonym for innovation would be fine. 127 00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.710 Jenny Duan: Social change. Maybe something like that 128 00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.840 Jenny Duan: cause like 129 00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:59.069 Jenny Duan: through these characters. You're also showing who you are. So like. You are also at the forefront of social change, which is like what we want to show through the analogy of these characters. 130 00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:16.280 huda: Or was I? I feel like I was kind of going, for like how like even son and Yasmin could be like in the face of or not in the face of, but like the forefront of kind of like AI, and like all these new things that are developing. And so I was focusing more on like. 131 00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.400 huda: how that's like. 132 00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:25.969 huda: how they can be like also in technology, because it's also about like the misrepresentation of like these people in technology, not just video games. 133 00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:27.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 134 00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.360 Siraj Nazir: Sorry to interrupt again. I mean, I I just want to like 135 00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.799 Siraj Nazir: Make sure that Rudar doesn't have to go through on the right iteration. I think Jenny has a very, very deep point there. 136 00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.531 Siraj Nazir: because in some ways you're also like, you know. 137 00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.030 Siraj Nazir: I think Sana and Yasmin are kind of a representation of you in some ways, right? 138 00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.050 Siraj Nazir: Because you're kind of. 139 00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:58.489 Siraj Nazir: I mean, I think there's there's some depth there, because you're kind of saying that. Okay, I used to see people like me in the background blur whatnot. And now I've basically put them. So there is an association there. 140 00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:14.559 Siraj Nazir: And I think that needs to come up. It's so. I think it's not really about others, others, others. Right? I think that's the point. Because when when you say like, Oh, I really want Sanan Yasmic to help others. You know other women and other like. I think it's more about like your journey as well. Right of growth. So yeah. 141 00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.069 Siraj Nazir: I think we should hone. We should hone that particular point. 142 00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.470 Siraj Nazir: try to embed it. 143 00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:30.806 huda: Are you suggesting that instead of saying that, like, I'm inviting, like the sun and Yasmeens of the world, to show that they're in in front, and that they could be in the forefront of social change. 144 00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:36.021 huda: Is it more like I'm showing, like myself, that I can also be in it? Is that what you're 145 00:16:36.270 --> 00:17:03.679 Jenny Duan: No, I think I don't think you need to say that you're showing yourself, I think, from reading this like an admissions officer can understand that Sana and Yasmeen are like a parallel to yourself. So anything that you write about Sana and Yasmeen, it's like a reflection of you like, if you say like, because you are the sana and yas, means of the world like that's who you are. So if you're saying that, like Sana and yas, means of the world can be at the forefront of social change. That's like a character trait about you, too, like you're at the forefront of social change, too. 146 00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.960 Jenny Duan: And this little change here is just like. 147 00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:22.379 Jenny Duan: I think you could either write technological innovation or social change, but just like swap the places. So here you could say leading social change if you want to put the emphasis there and here you could say technological innovation. But like they're a little bit interchangeable. So whatever you want to emphasize in that current paragraph. 148 00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:34.869 huda: Yeah, I think I think I'm just gonna switch them because I think these 2 like AI bias and reprogramming robots, you could tell like the games already about tech. And then like this kind of shows like the other aspect of the game. And then 149 00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:39.459 huda: here, yeah, I think this just sounds better in this space. 150 00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.060 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, so. 151 00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.319 huda: I haven't updated this paragraph yet. 152 00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:52.700 Siraj Nazir: So how? How do you? I mean again, like, I'm I'm not clear on that association. Are we able to address that association now like. So we need to remove the I invite this Ananyasmin right. 153 00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.470 Jenny Duan: I don't think I don't think you need to invite. I think it sounds good. 154 00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.339 Jenny Duan: I think it's like. 155 00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.239 Jenny Duan: And now I 156 00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.700 Jenny Duan: maybe what you can say is like 157 00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.029 Jenny Duan: through them. 158 00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.150 Jenny Duan: Hi. 159 00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.750 Jenny Duan: hope to inspire the 160 00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.690 Jenny Duan: future San. And yes, means of the world to see that they can also be at the forefront. Technological innovation. 161 00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.370 Siraj Nazir: How's that? 162 00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.180 Siraj Nazir: Because I. 163 00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:48.430 Jenny Duan: I think another thing that's in your activity section, which I also looked at. Huda is like you emphasize like distributing it to kids. And so if if an admissions officer read this and was like, Oh, like, I want to learn more about synthoria, they would. Their natural step would be to look at your look at your activity section in which they would find that like this is something that you're distributing to classrooms. And so that's where like, this is the connection because you're distributing it to like the next generation. The future sunnyas means. 164 00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.650 huda: Yeah. 165 00:18:49.960 --> 00:19:00.730 Jenny Duan: And that like connects to your passion for education and like education, advocacy which you show through like the mosque, volunteering, and other things. Anyways, it's all connected, which is what we want here. 166 00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:31.603 Jenny Duan: I. Through them I hope to inspire the future sun, and yes, means of the world to see that they can also be at the forefront of technological innovation. See the key here is this also, like this word also signals to the reader or to the admissions officer that, like you, are at the forefront of technological innovation and the future sun. And, yes, means are also at the forefront of technological innovation. So very small placement of words like that are like key signals into like your character via your essay. 167 00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:32.770 Siraj Nazir: Easy. Yeah. 168 00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:47.790 Jenny Duan: And then the next thing. So I think we can take this and use this sentence to improve this next transition, which is like you're talking about inspiring people. The women in games workshop is also, I think, like a means of inspiring other people. So 169 00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:55.669 Jenny Duan: hmm! Is there a way we can improve this transition to like kind of play off of that theme of inspiration. Do you think, does anything come to mind. 170 00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.140 huda: Yeah, definitely. I think. 171 00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.349 huda: I mean, also, like 172 00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.180 huda: I wanted I wanted to. Know, if like. 173 00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:32.909 huda: do I? Should I mention that it's like a woman in games workshop, cause. I think, like one of the feedback I also received was that like, it's kind of like naming kind of resume dropping a little bit, and so I don't know if that sounds like if I should even mention that, or if I just should generally say, like, I hosted like a workshop on like representation. But yeah, like, I think 174 00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.675 huda: besides that, like for the transition 175 00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:49.260 Siraj Nazir: This is great, Huda. I think that was from a different perspective. I don't think it applies. Now see, when I read this now it's it's not really like, see? Even like developing my games in Thoria now is so well connected. 176 00:20:49.750 --> 00:21:02.950 Siraj Nazir: You know, there's a subtle way of doing it. So it's not to say not to. I think you should just not be like, you know, boasting about it, you know, it's like, Okay, I've done Xyz. I think now you're showing us so I don't know. What do you feel, Jenny? I don't think it's a resume type now. 177 00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:14.229 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's resume either. Yeah, I mean, like, you're not saying like, Oh, this is the best workshop ever like. You're just saying you hosted this workshop which you did so I don't think it's like braggy. 178 00:21:15.155 --> 00:21:19.719 Jenny Duan: Okay, this. That decision echoed in the women in games workshop. 179 00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.380 Jenny Duan: So maybe like 180 00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.830 Jenny Duan: I don't know what is. What do you think is a way that you can transition this. 181 00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:59.029 huda: Maybe like I can talk about like how I wasn't the only one who spotted like myself in the background. Maybe I like realized that there was people from like 46 international cities that all had, like a similar experience of, you know, like seeing themselves as like blurs in the sceneries, and they wanted to do something to change it, whether that be through like their development, whether that be through like their character design like 182 00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:14.460 huda: And I think that I don't know how to word it specifically for the transition. But I wanna mention how like like, I wasn't alone in like this realization that, like there was many people that felt like blurs in the background. I wanted to change that. I think. 183 00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.576 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's let's like, try to sum that in one sentence. 184 00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.800 Jenny Duan: yeah. 185 00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.870 Siraj Nazir: But I think I think there is a progression here. Right? I think I I get like 186 00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.700 Siraj Nazir: I think I'm kind of reading Jenny's point. 187 00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:42.349 Siraj Nazir: like you've actually set the stage for inspiring. You've already said that you're you're you're distributing your synthoria game, you know. If they go to extracurricular activities. They know you're doing that. 188 00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:48.670 Siraj Nazir: Maybe we should use this as an opportunity. See at the end of the day what is the theme and problem again, the way I'm understanding it. 189 00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.610 Siraj Nazir: it is still diversity and inclusion. That's really the main 190 00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:02.170 Siraj Nazir: key. I think. AI and data science and all that is just like to show that you know you don't have to be at the back end like you. You need to. I mean, you can also be the forefront 191 00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.249 Siraj Nazir: women in games is again part of the same team, because. 192 00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:25.760 Siraj Nazir: you know, it's another channel through which you're kind of doing the same advocacy. I don't know. How do you like? I think there's a better way to show like, you know, what have you done here? I think there you have developed a game, and you're actually fighting the same cause. And I don't know. Probably you're doing something else in women's in game like, I don't know like that's that's how I view. You know this 193 00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.150 Siraj Nazir: thing to be 194 00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:35.340 Siraj Nazir: maybe it's about scaling the impact, I don't know, like, you know. So there's probably some other aspect of your profile that can be brought up here. I don't know. 195 00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.740 huda: 3. 196 00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.040 Jenny Duan: See you? 197 00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.600 Jenny Duan: that they can. 198 00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:06.809 Jenny Duan: I'm thinking, something like, okay, this, I I think this doesn't sound good, but I'm just writing it down as a placeholder. 199 00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.700 Jenny Duan: My. 200 00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:22.679 Jenny Duan: it's like something like that is what I'm thinking like. Obviously, not this exact phrasing, because that sounds bad, but like 201 00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.149 Jenny Duan: something like that. 202 00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.770 huda: Yeah, I think. 203 00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.600 huda: mommy. 204 00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:41.519 huda: maybe like, so in synthoria, there's like, the future sun. And yes means 205 00:24:41.890 --> 00:25:01.140 huda: this is okay. I don't know if this will come across like correctly. But the future sun and yes, means can be like the forefront of technological innovation. But in this woman, in games workshop like these participants are going to be in the forefront of game development. And like, I guess 206 00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.830 huda: social change in video games. So maybe. Like. 207 00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.900 huda: yeah, I I think this is fine. But 208 00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.360 huda: yeah, maybe like. 209 00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.500 huda: yeah, I'm not great at transitions. 210 00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:27.830 Siraj Nazir: I have a question, Jenny, here like you know, what is the what is really the underlying goal of this whole point that we are trying to relay here. Right? 211 00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.939 Siraj Nazir: So we start with the problem statement 212 00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.349 Siraj Nazir: where Hudav is defining a problem statement that 213 00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.850 Siraj Nazir: there isn't that you know, diversity, and especially like women of color, or like, you know, they're not at the forefront. 214 00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.439 Siraj Nazir: And then she comes up with her. She starts, you know, framing her solution. 215 00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:52.500 Siraj Nazir: And one of the 1st things she does is she actually builds this game synthoria, which kind of you know, is one of the solutions. And then 216 00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.619 Siraj Nazir: I think then I think so. So so to me, like I'm looking at the core of it. 217 00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:06.739 Siraj Nazir: and and might be the other way to think about it is, Jenny, like I know, a few things were taken out right from your earlier version like, do you think that there's anything missing here like, you know which? 218 00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.390 Siraj Nazir: you know 219 00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:18.310 Siraj Nazir: it. It's a very you know, women in games is really very complementary to the same theme of solution, right? 220 00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:36.119 Siraj Nazir: Because in some ways you're actually showing that you're actually now having a global impact. She's talking about Algeria. She's talking about that. And then you say, Okay, Hey, I took it I developed a game. I started my journey, and might be. This is one of the other venues that I did the same thing, but it from that perspective. It's still a repetition, right? Because you're still within that same solution, theme 221 00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:43.390 Siraj Nazir: which is perfectly fine. But then there needs to be some nuance and depth to it if you're picking up only on one topic. 222 00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:48.289 Siraj Nazir: I I just don't want it to be seen, like you know, as another kind of 223 00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.010 Siraj Nazir: check like, you know, telling. Oh, I scaled the impact. I did. XYZ. 224 00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.400 Siraj Nazir: So. 225 00:26:54.890 --> 00:27:01.349 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that this is maybe a good way to transition it like this mission like making it your personal mission. 226 00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:10.510 Jenny Duan: This mission came to life through the women in games workshop. I later hosted. Representation meant different things for the participants in the participants. Respective countries. 227 00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.820 Jenny Duan: An artist. I noticed 228 00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.720 Jenny Duan: the same drive. 229 00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.570 Jenny Duan: Okay? 230 00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:27.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think the sentence maybe needs to be made smoother. 231 00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.130 huda: Yeah, I agree. 232 00:27:31.818 --> 00:27:35.649 Jenny Duan: In the end. Isn't life the ultimate game? 233 00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.629 Siraj Nazir: I I think that's your 234 00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.545 Siraj Nazir: previous 235 00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.969 Siraj Nazir: conclusion right? Because I think that doesn't go well with the current one. 236 00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.969 huda: I think it still kind of works. 237 00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.520 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree. 238 00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.610 Siraj Nazir: Because you know you, I mean, you've taken me through a journey of you, basically going through this whole transformation and growth. 239 00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.309 Siraj Nazir: And you've come to a point where you're actually making an impact. 240 00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.060 Siraj Nazir: And now you're saying that 241 00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.530 Siraj Nazir: switching between roles, you know that kind of. 242 00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.169 Siraj Nazir: I just feel like 243 00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.550 Siraj Nazir: I've already like so much. I've submerged into your 244 00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.090 Siraj Nazir: yeah, acquiring new skills and facing unexpected challenges, switching between roles. So 245 00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.230 Siraj Nazir: well. 246 00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:43.879 huda: I think, since the I think it should maybe be parallel to the paragraph structure. Because acquiring new skills is like the 1st thing we learned that video games do to me, role players acquiring new skills. 247 00:28:44.208 --> 00:29:02.380 huda: switching between roles and facing unexpected challenges. Because that's the structure of the of the whole essay. It's like, 1st I learned about like my math problem, and then I talk about like switching from Urdu to English. And then the last one is facing unexpected challenges, which is like me realizing that oh, like video games 248 00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:04.350 huda: don't like represent me. 249 00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.940 huda: And then that's like kind of the structure 250 00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.150 huda: and 251 00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.649 huda: and I think this importance of representation could be changed. I agree. 252 00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.829 huda: but other than that, think 253 00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:21.460 huda: it matches. 254 00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.579 Jenny Duan: I think there, I think this conclusion is good. 255 00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:26.889 huda: Are you sure like this? 256 00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.459 huda: The sentence is it? Do you think it's 257 00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.090 huda: cliche. 258 00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:33.860 Jenny Duan: I mean. 259 00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.639 huda: Or this part? 260 00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:42.289 Siraj Nazir: Connection, actually, you know, with the 1st word in the end isn't like the ultimate game like it's it's very abrupt. 261 00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:47.819 Siraj Nazir: See? As I leave through their pictures. I notice their ability to transform advocacy into engagement. 262 00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.980 Siraj Nazir: Correct? 263 00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 264 00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.350 Jenny Duan: I think the connection. 265 00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.420 Siraj Nazir: Connection is not. 266 00:29:56.725 --> 00:30:09.024 huda: Generally I could, just insisting, like in the life in the end. Isn't life the ultimate game? I think I shouldn't talk about like how other people are players and how they're acquiring skills. I could say that like, 267 00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:27.200 huda: my life is a game, and that like maybe maybe like the quest this entire time has been inspiring others, I think, like in a video game, how there's like a quest like an end goal. And like an ultimate thing like maybe mine could be like inspiring others. And I gained that through. 268 00:30:27.632 --> 00:30:31.340 huda: This like unexpected challenge, which is diversity, I think. 269 00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.279 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think so. The connector that I'm hearing is like looking back. 270 00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:46.159 Siraj Nazir: This is what like. So you've you've come to a point right that you started from, like probably 6, th 8th grade, 7th grade. And then you've come to a point where you're basically now 271 00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.529 Siraj Nazir: engaged at a at a global level. 272 00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.899 Siraj Nazir: So now you're basically concluding and say, Hey, looking back, you know. 273 00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.220 Siraj Nazir: So that kind of a connection. 274 00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.909 Jenny Duan: How's this? 275 00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.029 Jenny Duan: I just change it to, after all. 276 00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.579 Jenny Duan: instead of in the end. 277 00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.569 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. Now, it looks good. Yeah. Because, after all, like, yeah, at least like. 278 00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.880 Siraj Nazir: yeah, it's not very abrupt. 279 00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.050 Jenny Duan: Great. 280 00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:31.439 Jenny Duan: I think importance of representation is fine, because you talk so much about the importance of representation. 281 00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.350 huda: Hmm. 282 00:31:32.635 --> 00:31:37.779 Jenny Duan: I do think it's important, but if you think it sounds like Corny, we could change it, too. 283 00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.289 Jenny Duan: What do you think. 284 00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.264 huda: Hmm! 285 00:31:41.470 --> 00:32:03.969 huda: I think, because, like this, the the words before complexities of my identity that's pretty like cause I already talked about like the complexities of my identity. So that's why it can be vague. So then, I think, like, maybe importance of representation can also be vague, because these 2 things are already discussed in their own paragraph. So maybe I don't need to elaborate here. So yeah, I I think it's fine. Actually. 286 00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.350 Jenny Duan: Okay, you could also say something like, I don't know, like 287 00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:11.570 Jenny Duan: power of inclusion, or the power of representation, or something like that. 288 00:32:12.528 --> 00:32:14.280 Jenny Duan: I think it's like. 289 00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:22.550 huda: Oh, yeah. Cause then I can cause. Then also, like the workshop, showed like the power of representation. So I think that that's better. 290 00:32:23.837 --> 00:32:26.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that sounds good. 291 00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.190 Jenny Duan: So, Raj, were you saying something? Sorry. 292 00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:37.850 Siraj Nazir: I, I was thinking, might be my journey. Sorry for being so nosy today and interrupting so much because I I'm under a lot of stress from Huda. You know she's given me an ultimatum. 293 00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.949 Siraj Nazir: So I'm trying my luck here. I think 294 00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.860 Siraj Nazir: my feeling that. 295 00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:50.300 Siraj Nazir: after all, isn't like the ultimate game. I think it's good, but I would still say you're kind of coming up to, you know the end and the climax 296 00:32:50.687 --> 00:32:55.070 Siraj Nazir: which is also very important, because that's the memory you want to leave behind, you know, and 297 00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:59.239 Siraj Nazir: my journey through virtual words has prepared me like, isn't that a good way to start 298 00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.220 Siraj Nazir: like, because you're kind of saying, Hey, you literally have taken us through your entire journey. 299 00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.479 Siraj Nazir: Might be. It's just kind of swapping it with. 300 00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.830 Siraj Nazir: I don't know. 301 00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:17.990 Jenny Duan: I kind of like the question here, cause I feel like it makes the admissions officer like pause and like, think and then continue. 302 00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:23.730 Jenny Duan: I don't know, Huda, what are your thoughts? I feel like. If we put the question in the middle, it might get lost in the paragraph. 303 00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.139 Siraj Nazir: Okay, okay, that's fine. 304 00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.319 Jenny Duan: But I don't know, Huda, what are your thoughts? 305 00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:37.789 huda: I think this sentence, my journey through virtual worlds is prepared for the complexities of my identity and power of representation. I think that's a like a good concluding like sentence. I 306 00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:42.555 huda: like you said like I feel like this 1st question is kind of like 307 00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.579 huda: like intriguing, I guess a little bit and also 308 00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:55.069 huda: also, like this part. It sounds I I mean, like it's so important. But I feel like it sounds kind of too generic to like, start off the paragraph with. 309 00:33:56.858 --> 00:33:59.890 Siraj Nazir: Might be that I'm I'm I'm kind of 310 00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:06.430 Siraj Nazir: just reading it without reading the entire thing. And you guys probably remember the entire essay much better. So it's perfectly fine. 311 00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:13.950 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is like already. Much better. Let's look at the feedback, the specific feedback again, and then go from there. 312 00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:19.010 Jenny Duan: So 1st thing, avoid listing achievements. Let's see, at 16. 313 00:34:19.564 --> 00:34:24.390 Jenny Duan: This is like fixed by this. I think that's like, not a problem anymore. 314 00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.379 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to talk about mentors, families, etc. I just. 315 00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:34.829 Jenny Duan: I don't think that's like so relevant to your story because it's not like you had like a professor you were working with, or something. So I think 316 00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.900 Jenny Duan: this is like fine 317 00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.749 Siraj Nazir: That's why I did not tag you guys on that. I mean. 318 00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe this like the challenges that you faced. 319 00:34:45.092 --> 00:34:49.810 Jenny Duan: Here, you, I think it's clear now, like what challenge you are facing. 320 00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.520 Jenny Duan: So I feel like that got resolved. 321 00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:54.100 Jenny Duan: This? 322 00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:00.460 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine because you you talk about their specific specifics. 323 00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:05.919 Jenny Duan: And then, I think, did you get rid of this. I think you got rid of this statement. 324 00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.090 Jenny Duan: Sentence. 325 00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:12.270 Siraj Nazir: I mean that that was not a strong statement. Anyways, I agree, like, there's there's nothing complex about it to be honest. 326 00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.620 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 327 00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:21.621 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. And and the other ones are the same. You know. This was just like across verification that independently like both both of 328 00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:28.450 Siraj Nazir: I think the do's are excellent lot of great things came out of and these, by the way, Jenny, these do's and don'ts 329 00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:33.590 Siraj Nazir: are not based on just essays. These are based on admission officer analysis. 330 00:35:34.024 --> 00:35:41.070 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I've taken that framework. We have basically provision that framework into our our private data. 331 00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:47.869 Siraj Nazir: And I ran that. So they applied the same thing right where I mean again, there's never like a perfect essay, right? So. 332 00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:48.490 Jenny Duan: Of course. 333 00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:56.290 Siraj Nazir: Do's and do's are, yeah, this is perfect one thing yeah. So I think awesome. This is great. One thing I had was like, because 334 00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:18.139 Siraj Nazir: Huda kept telling me that, hey, Jenny, you know, insisted a lot to add like AI data science. And so I think we've kind of removed that now, right? Because, you see, like AI data, science has no more. The center like that's not the central theme. The central theme is really about her identity, her experience, which is fine. I've seen many essays that absolutely don't talk about anything to do with major 335 00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:23.820 Siraj Nazir: amazing essays, you know, and including last year's, admits at Stanford Harvard as well. 336 00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:31.480 Siraj Nazir: So I'll I'll leave it up to you like if you think there's an there's something that really makes this week in terms of the majors. Then why not. 337 00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.749 Jenny Duan: I don't think so. I think this sounds really good. 338 00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:49.949 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think the next the steps, I think, Huda, let's have you read this out loud one more time, and then after that, I think by the end of today's session we should aim to be finalized, because at the end of the day like there, I mean. Obviously, an essay can always be improved 339 00:36:50.070 --> 00:37:17.280 Jenny Duan: every single time you read it, but at some point there are diminishing returns, and like just looking at one essay over and over, because an admissions officer is only going to look at it for Max 5 min. And so you don't want to have like one perfect essay, and then, like the rest of your application, not have the same amount of attention. So I think, like, once we finalize this, we can kind of move on, because at the end of the day, like your own, your admissions officer is going to spend like 5 min on this. So as long as it's like 340 00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.040 Jenny Duan: represents you, and it's like to the best of your ability. We don't need to like. 341 00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.130 Jenny Duan: I think, spend even more time making like 342 00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:29.290 Jenny Duan: very, very minute changes with a lot of time when we could spend that on other things. 343 00:37:29.805 --> 00:37:30.180 Jenny Duan: That's. 344 00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.419 Siraj Nazir: Mean, just recently. 345 00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:45.510 huda: I need to work on like the additional information, just like, make sure, like I know, like how to approach that one as well as like, I wanted to just like double check. If, like, my activities are fine for like 346 00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.860 huda: for submitting, because Unc is actually due in 2 days. So 347 00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:54.021 huda: yeah. And then, like, yeah. So I think I'll just I'll start reading it. 348 00:37:54.540 --> 00:38:00.040 Siraj Nazir: Quick question, Jenny, I mean, can this se be altered at all like after submitting it once. 349 00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:17.329 Jenny Duan: Yes, you can alter it every single time, like every time you submit the comment app, it's basically like frozen in time. So like once you submit it, it sends your common app as it is in that moment, but then, if you make new edits, it'll send like a new common app to every school, so you can still edit stuff after you submit it to Unc. 350 00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.420 Siraj Nazir: Wow! I didn't know that. Oh, it's not like uc, okay. 351 00:38:23.029 --> 00:38:27.299 Jenny Duan: yeah, so like, every time you submit this. Oh, go ahead. Sorry, to interrupt. 352 00:38:27.881 --> 00:38:34.150 huda: Just like a random update. I was actually thinking of applying early to Urbana champagne, too. 353 00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.639 Jenny Duan: No, and right. 354 00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:37.360 huda: Sorry. 355 00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.330 Jenny Duan: No essays. 356 00:38:39.155 --> 00:38:45.490 huda: There's 3, but they're they're a lot more direct, and I think they're just like one of those like Y major essays. 357 00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.889 Jenny Duan: Sure. I mean, I think, like the biggest thing is, as long as your teachers can send in their Recs, it doesn't really matter how. 358 00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.149 huda: And actually, Barney Rex, that's also a good thing. 359 00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.639 Jenny Duan: Perfect. Okay, then, so northeastern in urban champagne, then 360 00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:00.730 Jenny Duan: 2. 361 00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.380 huda: Yeah. 362 00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:09.470 huda: northeastern, I'm just gonna submit. I'm gonna submit it regular decision. But it's pretty much right now, because it's I'm pretty sure it's a private. 363 00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:16.110 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's private. And also, I think, no essays. So yeah, nice. 364 00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:26.259 Siraj Nazir: Okay, guys, thank you very much. I'm all good. So I think that works for me. With that I promise I won't give any more comments on this. Okay, take care. Might be until next submission. Not for this time. 365 00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.980 Siraj Nazir: bye. 366 00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.710 Jenny Duan: Sure. Yeah, thanks a lot. 367 00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:29.880 Jenny Duan: Bye. 368 00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:39.290 Jenny Duan: yeah, actually had, I felt like his feedback was really helpful, like, I think it's like good to get multiple eyes on this essay, because, like, since, we're reading it so much like. 369 00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:46.430 Jenny Duan: we might not notice things that, like other people, might, too. And I think you should still have your sister read it again, and like, see if she has any comments too. 370 00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:50.240 huda: I was definitely a bit frustrated in the beginning, because, like some of the changes were like. 371 00:39:50.280 --> 00:40:01.049 huda: I had to change a large portion of it. But then, like, I kind of just focused on like one aspect of it, and it kind of made it a little easier for me to like implement those changes. But yeah. 372 00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:05.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely. Okay, can you read this out loud? One more time, and then we should be able to move on. 373 00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:24.050 huda: By 8 Pm. I've baked 10 cakes, fed my sheep, discovered diamonds the next hour I'm managing a pizza franchise generating a 7 figure income at 7 a budding entrepreneur. If only my parents knew about my lucrative virtual empires, they might have reconsidered my allowance. 374 00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:39.969 huda: When I 1st picked up the ipad my sister and I shared. I didn't know it would offer me much more than its 3,145,728 pixels instead, it became a lens through which I learned to decode the real world. We don't just play video games. They play us, too. 375 00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:53.089 huda: When I solved a complex Redstone circuit in Minecraft, an automatic farm that resembled the one on the way to the grocery store. It wasn't just the game's mechanics that mattered. It was my statistics homework. That night 376 00:40:53.230 --> 00:41:01.970 huda: when, faced with a tricky, graphing problem, I approached it with the same strategy, step by step, like placing redstone components. I plotted analytics on the axes. 377 00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:08.540 huda: Even this past summer at Data Science Camp. I saw Redstone every time I fed data into regression models. 378 00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:21.489 huda: People praise games for the immersive experiences, but they often miss the point. It's how we carry that immersion into the real real world that matters how it bleeds into our decision, making our approaches to solving problems. 379 00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:28.080 huda: Soon it became routine, switching from a gladiator to a manager faster than you can press. Alt tab. 380 00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:38.220 huda: Perhaps it's this same innate ability that allows me to switch between Urdu and English without a second thought or from technical jargon at hackathons, to advocacy, at journalism conferences. 381 00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:54.100 huda: Each role comes with its own set of expectations and rules of engagement. Who am I, when not bound to one narrative, one language, or one role? And yet behind all the role switching and analytical skills I gained from games. There was one thing I had lost my individuality. 382 00:41:54.390 --> 00:42:00.389 huda: One evening, while playing assassin's creed, I spotted a woman, brown skinned, with surma in her eyes like me. 383 00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:05.470 huda: hidden in the background, selling fruit at a bazaar, a mere blur in the scenery. 384 00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:18.589 huda: characters who looked like me always, were always the ones I passed by, nameless and insignificant. I had learned to thrive in roles. Games provided me, but now, I ask myself, can games thrive in the roles? I provide them? 385 00:42:20.907 --> 00:42:23.589 huda: Wait! I meant to italicize this. 386 00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.984 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's exactly what we have to do. The read the final read over. 387 00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:30.484 huda: Yeah. 388 00:42:31.306 --> 00:42:42.799 huda: Developing my game synthoria. I dragged myself to the forefront. The protagonists, Sana and Yasmin aren't commodified. Instead, they're fighting AI bias reprogramming rogue robots and leading social change. 389 00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:47.629 huda: The protagonists are no longer nameless. Instead, they have loud Muslim names. 390 00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:54.450 huda: games, asks us to become someone else. All the time I've played as a detective raccoon and an Nba all-star. 391 00:42:54.570 --> 00:43:13.129 huda: Through them I hope to inspire the future Sana and Yasmins of the world to see that they can also be the forefront of technological innovation. This mission came to life with a women in games workshop. I later hosted. Representation meant different things in the participants respective countries. While a developer from Algeria argued 392 00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:20.630 huda: for for deradicalization in call of duty. An artist from France combated the submissive depiction of women. 393 00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:39.450 huda: I recognize the same drive, to step off the sidelines that I once felt with Synthoria. As I leafed through their pitches, I saw how they skillfully transformed advocacy into meaningful engagement. After all, isn't life the ultimate game? We're all players acquiring new skills, switching between roles and facing unexpected challenges. 394 00:43:39.530 --> 00:44:03.419 huda: My journey through virtual worlds has prepared me for the complexities of my identity and the power of representation. As I look to the future, I see myself continuing to bridge worlds in technology and culture and society, whether it's through game development, creating websites or crafting content that resonates with other women in tech. I hope to design experiences where everyone can level up regardless of their starting stats. All you have to do is press play. 395 00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.300 Jenny Duan: Yay. 396 00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:18.059 Jenny Duan: okay. Great. Okay. Now you you already know it's good. Let's not waste any more time on this essay or not waste. But let's not spend any more time on this. Let's go to your common app activities list. 397 00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:23.500 Jenny Duan: I believe I have it. Can you share a link in the chat, so I can find that right now. 398 00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:29.099 Jenny Duan: and I already looked at it, and I think it looks good. But I would like to. 399 00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:43.370 huda: That's an additional thing. I actually I was talking with one of my friends that I met at J. Camp, and she was writing her activities as well, and so for the organizations that she started. She added, like a semicolon, and described like kind of what it is. 400 00:44:43.657 --> 00:45:03.199 huda: She said, that it's because, like sometimes admissions officers like don't understand like what the project is. So it's like a quick little explanation. But I'm not sure like, if I need that or like, I can just cause I felt like just to clarify that like, it's an initiative that I found it, because people might be wondering like, Oh, like, what is this? So 401 00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.949 huda: I mean, I'm not sure. But yeah. 402 00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.650 Jenny Duan: If you have the word, count for it. 403 00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.000 Jenny Duan: Like, Yeah, that's good. 404 00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:09.590 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 405 00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:10.180 huda: Yeah. 406 00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.829 Jenny Duan: Same with Indoria, I think would be good. 407 00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:24.910 Jenny Duan: Like, I think, for Filmmakers Club. You don't need to, because, like they understand, that's a school club or J. Camp. You don't need like some of these, but for for folklift I would do the same. 408 00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:27.999 Jenny Duan: Put it, classy is fine. Women in games is fine. 409 00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.030 Jenny Duan: This is fine. 410 00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.370 Jenny Duan: This is like 411 00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.530 Jenny Duan: fun. 412 00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.189 Jenny Duan: I think, just for synthoria empowering AI and folklift. 413 00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:37.730 Jenny Duan: Be good 414 00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:47.640 huda: Should I mention like, I mean, I think the essays already mentioned like things about like the representation. So I shouldn't mention anything about like 415 00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:56.110 huda: that. But like with Cynthoria like, I'm not really sure like how else to describe it without like restating what the 1st bullet point is. 416 00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.620 Jenny Duan: Oh, then I think you don't need anything for Synthoria. 417 00:46:04.445 --> 00:46:04.820 huda: Folk. 418 00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:15.270 Jenny Duan: I think it's I think it's best. If you are able to like, put this in the information you would put here in the description, but I think like if it doesn't fit in the description, then you can put in the title. 419 00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.474 huda: because and then vocal could just be like 420 00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:23.460 huda: nonprofit 421 00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:25.689 huda: Gazette. 422 00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.570 huda: highlighting 423 00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.506 huda: minority stories, 424 00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:38.289 huda: stories from minorities. 425 00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.749 huda: Okay, yeah. That fits the word count or character count. 426 00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.740 Jenny Duan: Okay. 427 00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.240 Jenny Duan: can you say, like. 428 00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:08.750 Jenny Duan: can you? 429 00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.179 Jenny Duan: Somewhere in Jcamp, can you like emphasize? It's a summer? 430 00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.730 Jenny Duan: Oh, here is this one week summer program. 431 00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:16.490 huda: And also. 432 00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.909 Jenny Duan: You can write that it's summer program, or if you don't have words, it's fine, too. 433 00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.284 huda: Yeah, no, actually in 434 00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:30.990 huda: and like, when I'm putting it into the common app, it asks if it's like, during school or during a school break. 435 00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:32.450 huda: Oh, so I 436 00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:40.210 huda: school break, and then I and then I did it in 12th grade and I spent a hundred hours per week. And then I spent one week. So 437 00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:41.560 huda: great. Okay? 438 00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.700 huda: And 439 00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:56.048 huda: oh, yeah. And then I think I think, like in the actual common app, I put the 440 00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.240 huda: I put the 441 00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:04.180 huda: podcast club as like journalism and publications. Rather than 442 00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:05.670 huda: or actually, I was. 443 00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:18.529 huda: I think, this is the one that I was confused about if I wanted to do put it as oh, no. Independent was the one where I was confused. If I wanted to put it as computer slash technology or community service, volunteer. 444 00:48:22.435 --> 00:48:25.230 Jenny Duan: I think maybe computer science technology. 445 00:48:27.376 --> 00:48:28.190 huda: For independent. 446 00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.499 Jenny Duan: For independent. Yeah. 447 00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:31.640 huda: Okay. 448 00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.410 Jenny Duan: And is there like another? 449 00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.650 Jenny Duan: Okay. 450 00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.170 Jenny Duan: For the position? Is this something you can write in yourself? Yes, right. 451 00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.370 huda: Yeah. 452 00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.430 Jenny Duan: I don't. Is this what what does this 1% mean? 1% of locals. 453 00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.940 huda: Kind of like 300 locals. 454 00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.679 Jenny Duan: I feel like is not a compelling number. 455 00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:15.260 huda: Yes, that's what I was thinking when I was like talking with my, Danny said, like 3 people got the job from like the website. So like, that's pretty big deal. I don't know. 456 00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.910 huda: Yeah. 457 00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:19.839 huda: I don't think. 458 00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:34.820 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like, I think this sounds better than this, like I think, like reading this, you're like, Oh, you're helping 300 locals. But then, if you say like, only 1% get jobs, it's like, it's like them like back to back, I think, is, the doesn't sound quite right. So is there another thing you could write. 459 00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.580 huda: Maybe like 460 00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:48.830 huda: like on a different note, like some other freelancing that I've done. I think. 461 00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 462 00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.650 huda: I mean, like I've I think, like 463 00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:58.199 huda: I don't know. I don't really think like hackathons count, but because I don't really do freelancing that much. But. 464 00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:00.500 Jenny Duan: Oh. 465 00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.019 Jenny Duan: we could talk about hackathons! 466 00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.050 Jenny Duan: Why not? 467 00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.909 huda: Kind of like, quantify it, or like 468 00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.970 huda: I haven't done a hack on in some time, so I don't know like how that. 469 00:50:14.746 --> 00:50:16.299 Jenny Duan: In hackathons 470 00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:22.740 Jenny Duan: alongside college students, high school students, girls, what? What does your team formation look like. 471 00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:33.129 huda: Yeah, it's usually like college students, like women usually, and like, sometimes it was through like women hackathons. But then sometimes it was just like. 472 00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:35.160 huda: Yeah. 473 00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.499 Jenny Duan: Competing college hackathons. I think that's good. 474 00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:39.830 Jenny Duan: Okay? 475 00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:47.859 Jenny Duan: And it's under. Or you could say, build at college hackathons. But I think compete also sounds fine. 476 00:50:50.521 --> 00:50:53.589 huda: I think I'll do compete. Maybe. 477 00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:54.550 Jenny Duan: Okay. 478 00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.059 huda: Building, app building, app better. 479 00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:58.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 480 00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.170 Jenny Duan: you can just choose whatever word you think is best. But I think 481 00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:09.199 Jenny Duan: this is super impressive. I'm so happy, Huda, like I feel like. 482 00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:17.880 Jenny Duan: like I think I remember when we 1st like started meeting, like we really struggled, getting all these numbers right for all their activities. But like 483 00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:24.900 Jenny Duan: now that you see everything here like it looks so impressive when it's on paper, you know, like, and all your hard work is coming to an end. 484 00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:54.099 huda: I think some things that I just like I never really considered like, like, especially for Filmmakers Club, like increasing membership by that number, was like, I did like the math from like the year I wasn't president. And the year that I was president, and I was like, Okay, well, I actually made a change and and then, like the second bit, we're like reaching like 2.5 K students weekly, because it's shown like every classroom, and like what I'm doing. It just doesn't feel like that many people. But like now, quantifying, it feels really strange. 485 00:51:54.750 --> 00:52:00.709 Jenny Duan: This is so good, I'm so happy. Do you have a copy of your Awards list? Maybe we could go through that too. 486 00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:05.230 huda: Yeah, I just I didn't write it on here. I I think I'll 487 00:52:06.138 --> 00:52:09.479 huda: I I can just do it on the same, Doc. I'll put it underneath. 488 00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.000 Jenny Duan: Okay. Why don't you do that right now? 489 00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.199 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to like write descriptions. I think you just write the award names. 490 00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:19.827 huda: It's actually just like the same thing that I sent you. 491 00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:21.510 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. 492 00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:24.570 huda: Let me paste that here. 493 00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:37.300 huda: and also with additional information. I was wondering like, how I'm supposed to go about writing that. 494 00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.500 Jenny Duan: I think this looks good. 495 00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:57.909 Jenny Duan: I feel like these awards. Look good to me. I don't think you don't need to write anything else right besides the title of the Awards. 496 00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.600 huda: Yeah, just what grade you receive them. And then like, what level. 497 00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:03.389 Jenny Duan: Yeah, these look good 498 00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.330 Jenny Duan: national, national, international, International, School. 499 00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.970 Jenny Duan: National National. 500 00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.820 Jenny Duan: But the International. First, st I would say. 501 00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:20.440 Jenny Duan: and then put the school one last, I would say, also. 502 00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.560 Jenny Duan: great 503 00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.718 Jenny Duan: cool. I think this is all approved, if you want to submit, your 504 00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:35.430 Jenny Duan: you are you no, you are using its assays. 505 00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:36.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 506 00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:37.780 Jenny Duan: I think 507 00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:42.139 Jenny Duan: like for the Unc. One I feel like. 508 00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:49.639 Jenny Duan: let me look at your essays one more time. Let's go over that. And I feel like. If that's done, you can just submit the Unc. Tonight. If you want to. 509 00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:54.219 huda: Wait. So with the Additional Information Section, because I. 510 00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.430 Jenny Duan: Oh, thanks for reminding me about that. 511 00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:21.227 Jenny Duan: That's 1 thing we talk about. Sorry. Sorry I forgot. Yes, we need to talk about that. Can you make a new document? And like? Or if you already have a document for your additional information section, can you share that with me? And then I'll briefly talk you through what that looks like. So for your additional information section, I think the key here is going to be to highlight like economic adversity that your family has experienced. And this will be really, really helpful for 512 00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:26.180 Jenny Duan: yeah, like your admissions. So I think, like 513 00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:32.675 Jenny Duan: in unc specifically, I know you don't have any like information about 514 00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:56.679 Jenny Duan: about economic adversities. So maybe you can write that in additional information. So I think you only need to write a short paragraph so like, don't write like you don't need to write like a sob story. You're not trying to like, you know, like, write an essay. You're just trying like it doesn't have to be a story is what I'm saying. I think it should just be like information. 515 00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.460 Jenny Duan: we can say like. 516 00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:01.600 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! 517 00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:27.159 huda: So should I like mention, like last time I went with like additional information for Jcamp I talked about like when my parents were cause also, like last year's tax returns like it doesn't like accurately show that, like both of my parents were unemployed, but like so like, I don't know if it would reflect in like this, too. So I can just explain that like like they were unemployed this year, or like last year. And then. 518 00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:28.559 huda: like, I guess. 519 00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:30.879 huda: do I talk about like how it's affected me? 520 00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:37.910 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, basically, you could write what you wrote for J. Camp, and like, how that's affected you and like, affected your learning. 521 00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.490 huda: Yeah, let me just actually copy and paste what I put there and then just change it. 522 00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:48.230 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like again, I don't. It doesn't need to be any storytelling. You're just like delivering information to them 523 00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.190 Jenny Duan: that can. 524 00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:15.739 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say, like this financial crisis has challenged my 525 00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.220 huda: My access to some expensive resources, maybe. 526 00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:27.309 Jenny Duan: To. Yeah, my access to expensive educational programs and 527 00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:30.409 Jenny Duan: has inspired. Maybe you can talk about like. 528 00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:37.119 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is necessary. But I'm just gonna put out there. You decide if it's necessary. You can say like has inspired me to create 529 00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:52.989 Jenny Duan: my own education or like create organizations that, like pioneer education advocacy, because, like the one thing that you want to justify is, it's true that you're not really a part of any like national orgs or national organizations, because you're like working on your own stuff. So like 530 00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.900 Jenny Duan: like, you're also not part of like mock trial, or like model UN or anything. And so like. 531 00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.459 Jenny Duan: yeah, you've like, chosen to create your own opportunities. 532 00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 533 00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:07.650 Jenny Duan: resources for others. Similar 534 00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:09.470 Jenny Duan: situations. 535 00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.260 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say, like, I think. 536 00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:26.720 Jenny Duan: like the food stamps thing you should really emphasize. You could say, like, today, I am still on like I'm still the recipient of Cal you mentioned, like I don't remember the name of it like the Cal thing, and then you can say like. 537 00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.329 huda: Should I place that here. 538 00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.229 Jenny Duan: No, I think you should place it after you write about what you've done. 539 00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:38.239 Jenny Duan: Cause then it's like, it's like, you're sandwiching what you've done. Yeah. 540 00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:49.280 Jenny Duan: Or you can say I continue to receive, or I'm receiving something like that. 541 00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:12.990 huda: Hmm! 542 00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:15.995 huda: Why, 543 00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:19.160 huda: maybe like 544 00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:20.830 huda: while these 545 00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:23.000 huda: why, like. 546 00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.841 huda: actually, I don't know what I was. Gonna say, 547 00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:40.020 huda: is this just like one look at the additional information goes out to the call colleges, so could I end up with something like, I hope to like 548 00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.580 huda: like 549 00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.159 huda: like. Use your campus as like 550 00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.920 huda: my 551 00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:52.260 huda: or like utilize it despite like all these things, maybe I don't know. 552 00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.029 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that's redundant. 553 00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.180 huda: Hmm. 554 00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.124 huda: I think it's 555 00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.649 huda: yeah, I think this is. 556 00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.750 huda: This sentence is fine. 557 00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.110 huda: Hmm. 558 00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.680 Jenny Duan: I think that I think like this is all you really need to write. I don't think you need to write more than that. 559 00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.030 huda: Can I mention like like being like a family of 5. 560 00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:53.890 Jenny Duan: How's that? 561 00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.709 huda: Okay. But do you it looks. 562 00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:59.379 Jenny Duan: Maybe in the beginning, too. 563 01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.220 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 564 01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.709 huda: Yeah. Over here. 565 01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:06.370 Jenny Duan: How's that? 566 01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.060 huda: That was great 567 01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.510 huda: and. 568 01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:29.419 Jenny Duan: You don't have to write as a software engineer, because people know that engineers in the Bay area make money. So you don't need to write that. 569 01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.040 huda: Hmm. 570 01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:39.970 huda: okay. And like, is there anything? I I think that's like the most important part that I have to address and additional information. But 571 01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.650 huda: yeah, like, I don't know if there's anything else I should 572 01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.980 huda: mention. 573 01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:47.420 Jenny Duan: I think this is all. I think that looks good. 574 01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.010 huda: I agree. 575 01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.379 huda: and I'll put that into call. 576 01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.930 Jenny Duan: Do you wanna look at here. 577 01:00:58.377 --> 01:01:00.350 Jenny Duan: new and Csa's 578 01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:07.349 Jenny Duan: has your dad looked at these. 579 01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:11.190 huda: No, he says he doesn't. He doesn't really like 580 01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:18.279 huda: I mean, like he didn't say like this way, he said. He doesn't really care if it's like not too like 581 01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.240 huda: ivy level. You described it, but 582 01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.412 Jenny Duan: This is Unc. 583 01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:34.240 Jenny Duan: okay, that's fine. But Unc is important because they have that scholarship program which is like, I don't think you should go to Unc unless you're a like Robertson scholar, or like the other 584 01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.840 Jenny Duan: scholarship. 585 01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:37.060 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 586 01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:39.519 Jenny Duan: But I do think these essays are good. I think 587 01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:42.050 Jenny Duan: we've looked at these several times. I think. 588 01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:48.139 Jenny Duan: to the extent that you think these essays are good. I think you can be ready to submit it whenever 589 01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:57.520 Jenny Duan: you think they're good. I think they're good, but I think you should think they're good. So whenever you think they're ready, I think like it's approved by me. Whenever you want. 590 01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.350 huda: Yeah, I 591 01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.469 huda: I think 592 01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.589 huda: I think they're great. I don't. It's okay. So for Number 2, and it's 593 01:02:07.847 --> 01:02:10.649 huda: talking about like curiosity, I guess. 594 01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:11.750 huda: Oh. 595 01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:18.929 huda: do you think it's like it was correct to I guess. Like name specific things at 596 01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.730 huda: unc like resources. 597 01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's great. 598 01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:27.450 huda: Okay. And I think I'm gonna put this in quote. So it's 599 01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.450 huda: more clear. 600 01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.640 huda: And this is 601 01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:35.390 huda: okay. 602 01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.040 huda: Then I think that's like the entire application. Then. 603 01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.170 Jenny Duan: Oh. 604 01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.720 Jenny Duan: okay, I think whenever you're ready you can. 605 01:02:46.280 --> 01:03:00.690 Jenny Duan: I think if you want, you can have your dad look over like everything. If you. If you want to see the activities list or the Awards list, maybe he can look over that, or the Additional information section, or your sister, or like anyone. But I think, like, whenever you're ready, you could submit this, and this will be your 1st submission. 606 01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:08.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so exciting also. Oh, see if you can get fee waivers for all of your applications. 607 01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:25.349 huda: Yeah, I in common app, like, there's like a 1 of like the I guess, like tabs is like the fee waiver. And I've like applied for it. And I think my counselor has to give like my like financial, like information to the colleges. So 608 01:03:26.276 --> 01:03:30.119 huda: yeah, I don't think that's like. I don't think I have to submit anything yet. 609 01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:37.670 Jenny Duan: Alright like. Just make sure you have fee waivers, because qualifications are so expensive, for no reason like 610 01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:43.870 Jenny Duan: they're way too expensive. So get your fee waivers and save money and like, buy Boba instead, or something like, Yeah. 611 01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:57.130 Jenny Duan: and yeah, I think I'm so happy I I think you're ready to submit. So in the next couple of days, just text me when you submit it. And yeah, I will like, send you like a congratulations, a little celebration. 612 01:03:57.824 --> 01:04:03.209 Jenny Duan: And yeah, I'm really happy about these, I think, moving forward just like 613 01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:20.469 Jenny Duan: a laundry list of like things that still need to get done are approving the Stanford supplements. I think the uiuc supplements, because we're adding those, even though those, I think, could probably be reused from other essays. And then the Uc supplements. Right? These are like the main 3 top of mind things at the moment. Right? 614 01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:21.470 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 615 01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.050 Jenny Duan: Okay, when do you want to meet next. 616 01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.190 huda: We can meet maybe, like 617 01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.360 huda: Tuesday. Are you available. 618 01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.390 Jenny Duan: Tuesday would be great. What about like 7 30? Is that a good time for you? 619 01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.889 huda: Yeah, that works for me. 620 01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:39.984 Jenny Duan: Great. 621 01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:45.484 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do that. And yeah, 622 01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.529 Jenny Duan: great. I'm so happy for you. I feel like 623 01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:53.569 Jenny Duan: you've really come so far. You should be so proud of yourself. 624 01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:06.060 huda: Yeah, I just I really wanted to thank you. Because, like, I think the 1st time that, like my dad connected us over that call. I think I just genuinely knew that, like you'd be able to help me because 625 01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:15.400 huda: I don't know. I just I felt like really inspired by you and I just like felt like really lost before, and I didn't really know where I was going. And now I feel like. 626 01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:22.389 huda: well, like all this guidance. It's it's been so great and like I don't. I don't think I would have done any of this without you, so. 627 01:05:22.663 --> 01:05:38.550 Jenny Duan: We did this together, and like, I think, like the brilliant part is just like seeing how far you've come and like to be honest like college applications are just like it's like just the final thing. But like you've already done all of the work to like, get here. And at the end of the day, like 628 01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:45.620 Jenny Duan: like you've done so much hard work. You're gonna end up going to an amazing school like I'm just so excited to see like where you end up. And like. 629 01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:52.570 Jenny Duan: I think at this point it's just like, See reaping the benefits of like all your hard work, you know. So yeah. 630 01:05:52.870 --> 01:06:03.290 Jenny Duan: congrats again. And also like, just don't be so stressed on. I think another piece of unwarranted advice. Maybe it's like, don't be so stressed like, don't place all your heart and soul into like 631 01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:15.260 Jenny Duan: one place, because, like I think, like, it will all sort itself out, and you'll like end up where you need to be and like you're gonna end up going to an amazing school like you already know that. So just like sit back and like, let like 632 01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:19.530 Jenny Duan: the universe, you know, like play play out how it's meant to be. 633 01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:21.860 huda: Thank you so much. 634 01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:27.760 Jenny Duan: Alright.

I like your hair. 3 00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.056 Jenny Duan: Oh, thank you. I went back to black or dark hair today. 4 00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:35.190 Jenny Duan: All right, let's just get started. I don't know. We have limited time today, so maybe we could just get started with your dad's review of your common app. Hi, Siraj. 5 00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.060 Siraj Nazir: Hey? How's it going, Jenny? 6 00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.926 Jenny Duan: Doing pretty well. How are you? I saw your feedback, for who does essays like I saw the document so maybe we could start with that 7 00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.459 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I want to do that. In fact, actually, Huda is actually incorporated. And I'll I promise I'll leave like in 5 min. 8 00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:00.160 Siraj Nazir: What I wanted to do was because I think Hudab ha wanted me to join, because, she said, it's like I'm done with this. So if you want to make anything happen now is the time 9 00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.870 Siraj Nazir: which I can understand. Just give me one sec. 10 00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.949 Siraj Nazir: Can you share it? I mean, you know, I'm just setting up my new 11 00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.989 Siraj Nazir: Mac. Actually, everything is like everything needs to be set up. So if you can. 12 00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.659 huda: I've put it in the chat. 13 00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:26.940 Siraj Nazir: Great. I think fundamentally 2 points. Okay, Jenny. And I, I, you know. And I think it's it's really, like, you know, based on all the other essays and and you see, like, independently 14 00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:37.900 Siraj Nazir: it's the same kind of database that I pinged into. But I I use Claudia. And then I also use open AI, and it's pretty much the same thing, right? So 15 00:01:39.288 --> 00:",
    "01:45.929 Siraj Nazir: there are areas where I feel there is a lot of thought leadership in the second part, especially 16 00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.260 Siraj Nazir: right where she's making basically statements around, you know, like, you know. 17 00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.569 Siraj Nazir: stats. And then, you know, hey, this is what people think people feel this and that. I think we need to personalize it a bit more 18 00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.030 Siraj Nazir: and 19 00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:07.470 Siraj Nazir: and I think, there isn't like per se. I would say like at least like challenge. You know, a few challenges, or at least one challenge that that's kind of 20 00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:11.566 Siraj Nazir: there, I think Huda's done a good job. She's actually brought up 21 00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:31.420 Siraj Nazir: so personalization, adding in at least some challenge on how she basically went through the experience like telling you know that those points through her experience versus just you know, making some statements and claim, that's 1. Yeah, I think, apart from that. It's it's it's it's all good. 22 00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:49.509 Siraj Nazir: And I think Huda is going to walk you through. I think what she's come up with, you know, and like this is precisely what I've always seen synthoria, as you know, I know that there's AI, there's data, science and all that, but really like, for the most creative part of synthoria. Game was always like Huda being able to come up with the characters right, Sana and Yasmin 23 00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:55.379 Siraj Nazir: that that was the most creative part that that really wowed. Many people right who have seen that game. 24 00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:09.890 Siraj Nazir: And I think in some ways the second part is about that diversity, lack of diversity and inclusion in gaming. I feel that should be really the highlight, and I think Huda has done a good job there. I think AI data. Science and education probably is not the real th",
    "eme of this essay. 25 00:03:10.498 --> 00:03:12.729 Siraj Nazir: What we need to do probably, is 26 00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:15.395 Siraj Nazir: have that as 27 00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.279 Siraj Nazir: yeah, might be Huda. I I'll just listen in. And then, you know I 1st tell me like, what do you feel about the the feedback 28 00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:30.259 Siraj Nazir: that we have got. You know, when I ran Huda's essay through, you know the other kind of 200 plus essays. 29 00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.320 Jenny Duan: Are you asking me? Or Hudo. 30 00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.780 Siraj Nazir: Sorry. 31 00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.140 huda: Are you- are you. 32 00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.410 Jenny Duan: Are you asking me, or. 33 00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.029 Siraj Nazir: I'm asking you, Jenny, like I mean, I think I'm kind of convinced, because, you know 34 00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.240 Siraj Nazir: I think I've I've kind of ran a few more essays and stuff like that. I've read, you know, again, like I wanted to make sure that you know I'm not giving like a wrong advice. 35 00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.930 Siraj Nazir: I think there are certain areas. Yeah. 36 00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:04.490 Jenny Duan: I think, maybe 37 00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:15.270 Jenny Duan: here, I feel like we don't. We don't, I think this, I think this statement is fine, I think I don't really see any problem with this. 38 00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.140 Jenny Duan: I think 39 00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.510 Jenny Duan: this, maybe. 40 00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:25.370 Jenny Duan: Yes, we could be more specific here, I agree. But I also think, like 41 00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:36.200 Jenny Duan: this essay is quite. It's only 650 words. So there's like a limited amount of specificity that we can get to but for. But I think here is maybe one place. We could be more specific. 42 00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.410 Siraj Nazir: Exactly. 43 00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.249 Jenny Duan: I think I don't know if we need to write about",
    " too many challenges here, because I just don't know if we have space 44 00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:56.640 Jenny Duan: But I think that it does like this essay does good. Do a good job of like talking about challenges in general, like here, I feel like this is a good discussion of challenges, and like how she's overcome. 45 00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.530 Jenny Duan: So I don't know. Necessarily, if we. 46 00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:12.179 Siraj Nazir: You guys have spent more time in it, I think again, even the last point, if you see 5 right? It was not really about simplifying like, I mean again, they they talk about specific example, right? Of how the games. I think it's more the experience like 47 00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:21.450 Siraj Nazir: framing it as a way of experience versus like talking about diversity and inclusion like, without like, without without experiencing anything about it like. So that's like out of the pool. 48 00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.860 Siraj Nazir: right? It's out of the blue that who does talking about diversity and inclusion in games like. So I think that is, that is a gap that who does actually filled. And 49 00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:49.579 Siraj Nazir: it it's precisely why Hula actually added those characters. So it was really a self, you know, introspection and reflection. And and I think let's get going. I think I'm gonna go on mute. I will just see like who the you know. Read her, just help her, you know, finalize and edit. I I'm personally very, very happy with that. But again, it's entirely up to you guys if you feel like it's not coming along. Well. 50 00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.069 Siraj Nazir: then, that's fine, too. So. 51 00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:11.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, totally. I think. 1st of all, like, I'm curious, like, what are your thoughts? In my opinion, I think like this does give good feedback, and but I think, like maybe not everything. But it does give some good points. But I'm curious, like, how do you feel about your essay as",
    " it currently is, and like what what you've your takeaway from this feedback is. 52 00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:25.129 huda: Yeah, I actually had a chat with my dad about this about this feedback, and then like, I agree that some statements like the oversimplifying complex topics. That one is a bit like 53 00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:55.402 huda: like, I feel like we explained it pretty well in the essay. But yeah, I also definitely feel like the overcoming adversity might not have been clear. And I think, like you mentioned also, like the the trope that I kind of like had in my story, like the one where I'm like deciding if I want to name son or Yasmin, or actually ava, and that's like a really common trope of like, I think you said it was like the lunchbox story. But yeah. So then I actually 54 00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:11.004 huda: took these took this like advice and kind of put it in another iteration. So in like the draft document. I think if you see on like the left side, it says iteration one. And I added, like, so most of it's the same. But 55 00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:20.188 huda: right here. I added, like a new kind of like turn, like twist to it. So right after I say, 56 00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:34.569 huda: who am I when not bound to one narrative, one language or one rule? And this is when I'm after I talked about like learning problem solving from video games. And then I talk about how video games help me like, learn how to like rule switch 57 00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:58.529 huda: and then, so I start this new part and says, and yet, behind all the role switching and analytic skills I gained, there was one thing I had lost from from games my individuality. One evening, while playing assassin's creed, I spotted a woman, brown skinned, with surma in her eyes like me, hidden in the background, selling fruit at a market stall, a mere blur in the scenery. 58 00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.439 huda: Characters who looked like me were always the ones I passed by, nameless and insign",
    "ificant. 59 00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:18.064 huda: So I guess I'm kind of like giving like a little bit of a an anecdote about like why I like when I realized that, like diversity, is an issue with like people that look like me. And then I continue on to say, 60 00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:38.599 huda: like this is, I guess, like my introspection, and I'm saying it struck me that, like the woman in the bazaar, I, too, am the supporting character, always stepping into the shoes of gladiators, detectives, Nba all-stars, but never wearing my own. I had learned to thrive in the roles. Games provided me, but now, I ask myself, can games thrive in the roles I provide them. 61 00:08:38.900 --> 00:09:03.809 huda: And so this like next part, I tried developing, but I don't think it's fully developed yet. But, I said, developing my game synthoria. I dragged myself to the forefront. The protagonists, Sana and Yasmin were behind a fruit weren't behind a fruit stall at the bazaar instead, they were fighting AI bias, reprogramming rogue robots, and in the face of technological innovation the protagonists are no longer nameless. Instead, they have loud Muslim names. 62 00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:18.500 huda: games, asks us to become someone else. All the time I've played as a detective raccoon in an Nba all-star, and now I invite the Yasmin and Sennas of the world to see that they can also be in the forefront of innovation. 63 00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:22.910 huda: And then, like this next part, I haven't updated it so like matches. 64 00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:32.809 huda: it doesn't match with this new iteration, because I kind of just started working on it. But yeah, like, I think I can like fix this so it has to do with this one as well. 65 00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.880 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I actually think this is really, really good. 66 00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.829 Jenny Duan: I think that this last. 67 00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:46.009 Siraj Nazir: I was actually watching your expression, Jenn",
    "y. I think I think even if you said otherwise, you know, I would have caught you there. 68 00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:52.259 Siraj Nazir: I think there was an instant reaction. I think the way you know, it's also very authentic. That's what I love, because this is her story. 69 00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.990 Siraj Nazir: I don't want anything to be cooked up because she doesn't have to cook up anything. Honestly, it's such a thanks. 70 00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is so good. Yeah. I deleted this paragraph because I just felt like it was repetitive. And I don't think that you need this. 71 00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.340 Jenny Duan: But 72 00:10:07.892 --> 00:10:10.790 Jenny Duan: I think like this is enough of a transition. 73 00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:21.260 huda: Actually with that paragraph I was wondering, cause, like the part where it says that, like I relate myself with, like the woman in the bazaar. 74 00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.939 Jenny Duan: I think, cause you say, like me, I think that's enough of a signal. 75 00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.420 huda: Okay. 76 00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:45.040 huda: do you think this is enough like intro to like like the problem that I wanted to fix or actually, I kind of really like the last sentence of the paragraph, and that like was deleted cause. It's like directly leading to the next paragraph. I think. 77 00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.620 huda: Yeah. 78 00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.499 Siraj Nazir: I think the one that yeah, I mean again, I I have a view just like on that. It's like. 79 00:10:53.510 --> 00:11:00.190 Siraj Nazir: really the fact that you know. You know, might be assassin creed, and you know, brown skin. Probably you don't need that. 80 00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:08.150 Siraj Nazir: I think. But that she walked past someone like her all the time. I think that's kind of that sets the context right like. 81 00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:16.730 Siraj Nazir: So I don't know how you frame it might be. We have to probab",
    "ly reduce. I do agree. There's a lot of you don't have to tell that, you know, like me. Then again, brown skinned, I think. 82 00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:24.890 Siraj Nazir: So I think we can probably compress that. But I don't know if, Jenny, you had some other like. Why do you felt that it was kind of a redundant product. 83 00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:31.841 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean gladiators and Nba detect detectives. Nba, all stars you like already mentioned that. 84 00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:42.079 Jenny Duan: Later, when you're saying like how you played as a detective raccoon and be all star. I think it's fine if you leave it there. And also like, I think this is just. 85 00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.550 Jenny Duan: I don't want. I don't want you to say that you are the supporting character, because I feel like that's 86 00:11:47.610 --> 00:12:09.770 Jenny Duan: like that. Doesn't that like diminishes you because it doesn't show that, like you are becoming by saying, like you are the supporting character. It's not like you were the supporting character. It's like this is how you are in your current state. And since, like, we're using this as an analogy to show growth, we don't want to typify that you are the supporting character right now, we want to say like, Oh, you can make 87 00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:17.570 Jenny Duan: like you maybe used to be more shy. But like, since developing these different platforms like you've grown in these ways, and so I don't want to say that, like you are 88 00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:22.700 Jenny Duan: like the woman in the bazaar, and you are the sporting character in this moment? Does that make sense. 89 00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.720 huda: Yeah. 90 00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.449 Jenny Duan: Okay? So that's why I think like this is enough of a transition. 91 00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.790 Jenny Duan: I like this sentence. 92 00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.320 Jenny Duan: the protagonists 93 00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.890 Jenny Duan: and yes, the prota",
    "gonist 94 00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:41.420 Jenny Duan: aren't. And I think this is like, maybe too much repetition. Here. We don't need this context. 95 00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.030 Jenny Duan: Maybe 96 00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:50.689 Jenny Duan: maybe instead of saying this, you can like paraphrase it in another way, like maybe they're not. 97 00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:58.199 Jenny Duan: I don't know merely like background characters, or like they're not merely like scenery, or they're not merely like 98 00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.119 Jenny Duan: decoration, or 99 00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.629 Jenny Duan: like they're not. 100 00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.260 huda: Blurs in the background. 101 00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.519 Jenny Duan: I think you already say blurs in the back like you say hidden 102 00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.660 Jenny Duan: here. 103 00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:14.789 Jenny Duan: I think maybe another thing that you can touch on is like 104 00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.770 Jenny Duan: how 105 00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:27.229 Jenny Duan: maybe, like women of color, or just like people of color, often like uses, like decoration or commodification in like games or shows like, it's like like forced representation. 106 00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.170 Jenny Duan: If you know what I mean, where it like feels unnatural. But just because the game makers like were 107 00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.590 Jenny Duan: TV producers want to have someone, but 108 00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:41.594 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that is that applicable here. But that is another issue. We're talking to Sona and Yasmeen, aren't 109 00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.239 Jenny Duan: I don't know, like decoration, or I don't. I don't know what the best. 110 00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.970 Siraj Nazir: In other words, they're not the main lead, you know. That's what it is. I mean. So. 111 00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.440 Jenny Duan: Come out of right. 112 00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.230 Siraj Nazir: So. 113 00:13:55.170 --",
    "> 00:13:56.379 Jenny Duan: That's good, Huda. 114 00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.969 Jenny Duan: and could modify 115 00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.420 Jenny Duan: and said, they are fighting AI bias, reprogramming group of. 116 00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.500 Jenny Duan: and 117 00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.749 Jenny Duan: maybe, instead of in the face, you can see like 118 00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.450 Jenny Duan: leading technological innovation or something. 119 00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.150 huda: Hmm. 120 00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:24.230 Jenny Duan: Is in the face implies that, like technological innovation is something that's done to them rather than something that they're individually pursuing. 121 00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.880 Jenny Duan: this is great. 122 00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.710 Jenny Duan: This is great. 123 00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.860 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is a repetition of this. 124 00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.729 Jenny Duan: So can we write this in a different way. 125 00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.680 huda: Yeah, so. 126 00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.819 Jenny Duan: Change. Another word for synonym for innovation would be fine. 127 00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.710 Jenny Duan: Social change. Maybe something like that 128 00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.840 Jenny Duan: cause like 129 00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:59.069 Jenny Duan: through these characters. You're also showing who you are. So like. You are also at the forefront of social change, which is like what we want to show through the analogy of these characters. 130 00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:16.280 huda: Or was I? I feel like I was kind of going, for like how like even son and Yasmin could be like in the face of or not in the face of, but like the forefront of kind of like AI, and like all these new things that are developing. And so I was focusing more on like. 131 00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.400 huda: how that's like. 132 00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:25.969 huda: how they can be like also in technology, because it's also about like the ",
    "misrepresentation of like these people in technology, not just video games. 133 00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:27.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 134 00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.360 Siraj Nazir: Sorry to interrupt again. I mean, I I just want to like 135 00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.799 Siraj Nazir: Make sure that Rudar doesn't have to go through on the right iteration. I think Jenny has a very, very deep point there. 136 00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.531 Siraj Nazir: because in some ways you're also like, you know. 137 00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.030 Siraj Nazir: I think Sana and Yasmin are kind of a representation of you in some ways, right? 138 00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.050 Siraj Nazir: Because you're kind of. 139 00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:58.489 Siraj Nazir: I mean, I think there's there's some depth there, because you're kind of saying that. Okay, I used to see people like me in the background blur whatnot. And now I've basically put them. So there is an association there. 140 00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:14.559 Siraj Nazir: And I think that needs to come up. It's so. I think it's not really about others, others, others. Right? I think that's the point. Because when when you say like, Oh, I really want Sanan Yasmic to help others. You know other women and other like. I think it's more about like your journey as well. Right of growth. So yeah. 141 00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.069 Siraj Nazir: I think we should hone. We should hone that particular point. 142 00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.470 Siraj Nazir: try to embed it. 143 00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:30.806 huda: Are you suggesting that instead of saying that, like, I'm inviting, like the sun and Yasmeens of the world, to show that they're in in front, and that they could be in the forefront of social change. 144 00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:36.021 huda: Is it more like I'm showing, like myself, that I can also be in it? Is that what you're 145 00:16:36.270 --> 00:17:03.679 Jenny Duan: No, I think I don't think you need to say that you're showing yourself, I think, ",
    "from reading this like an admissions officer can understand that Sana and Yasmeen are like a parallel to yourself. So anything that you write about Sana and Yasmeen, it's like a reflection of you like, if you say like, because you are the sana and yas, means of the world like that's who you are. So if you're saying that, like Sana and yas, means of the world can be at the forefront of social change. That's like a character trait about you, too, like you're at the forefront of social change, too. 146 00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.960 Jenny Duan: And this little change here is just like. 147 00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:22.379 Jenny Duan: I think you could either write technological innovation or social change, but just like swap the places. So here you could say leading social change if you want to put the emphasis there and here you could say technological innovation. But like they're a little bit interchangeable. So whatever you want to emphasize in that current paragraph. 148 00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:34.869 huda: Yeah, I think I think I'm just gonna switch them because I think these 2 like AI bias and reprogramming robots, you could tell like the games already about tech. And then like this kind of shows like the other aspect of the game. And then 149 00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:39.459 huda: here, yeah, I think this just sounds better in this space. 150 00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.060 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, so. 151 00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.319 huda: I haven't updated this paragraph yet. 152 00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:52.700 Siraj Nazir: So how? How do you? I mean again, like, I'm I'm not clear on that association. Are we able to address that association now like. So we need to remove the I invite this Ananyasmin right. 153 00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.470 Jenny Duan: I don't think I don't think you need to invite. I think it sounds good. 154 00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.339 Jenny Duan: I think it's like. 155 00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.239 Jenny Duan: And now I 156 00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.700 Je",
    "nny Duan: maybe what you can say is like 157 00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.029 Jenny Duan: through them. 158 00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.150 Jenny Duan: Hi. 159 00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.750 Jenny Duan: hope to inspire the 160 00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.690 Jenny Duan: future San. And yes, means of the world to see that they can also be at the forefront. Technological innovation. 161 00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.370 Siraj Nazir: How's that? 162 00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.180 Siraj Nazir: Because I. 163 00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:48.430 Jenny Duan: I think another thing that's in your activity section, which I also looked at. Huda is like you emphasize like distributing it to kids. And so if if an admissions officer read this and was like, Oh, like, I want to learn more about synthoria, they would. Their natural step would be to look at your look at your activity section in which they would find that like this is something that you're distributing to classrooms. And so that's where like, this is the connection because you're distributing it to like the next generation. The future sunnyas means. 164 00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.650 huda: Yeah. 165 00:18:49.960 --> 00:19:00.730 Jenny Duan: And that like connects to your passion for education and like education, advocacy which you show through like the mosque, volunteering, and other things. Anyways, it's all connected, which is what we want here. 166 00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:31.603 Jenny Duan: I. Through them I hope to inspire the future sun, and yes, means of the world to see that they can also be at the forefront of technological innovation. See the key here is this also, like this word also signals to the reader or to the admissions officer that, like you, are at the forefront of technological innovation and the future sun. And, yes, means are also at the forefront of technological innovation. So very small placement of words like that are like key signals into like your character via your essay. 167 00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:32.770 Siraj",
    " Nazir: Easy. Yeah. 168 00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:47.790 Jenny Duan: And then the next thing. So I think we can take this and use this sentence to improve this next transition, which is like you're talking about inspiring people. The women in games workshop is also, I think, like a means of inspiring other people. So 169 00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:55.669 Jenny Duan: hmm! Is there a way we can improve this transition to like kind of play off of that theme of inspiration. Do you think, does anything come to mind. 170 00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.140 huda: Yeah, definitely. I think. 171 00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.349 huda: I mean, also, like 172 00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.180 huda: I wanted I wanted to. Know, if like. 173 00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:32.909 huda: do I? Should I mention that it's like a woman in games workshop, cause. I think, like one of the feedback I also received was that like, it's kind of like naming kind of resume dropping a little bit, and so I don't know if that sounds like if I should even mention that, or if I just should generally say, like, I hosted like a workshop on like representation. But yeah, like, I think 174 00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.675 huda: besides that, like for the transition 175 00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:49.260 Siraj Nazir: This is great, Huda. I think that was from a different perspective. I don't think it applies. Now see, when I read this now it's it's not really like, see? Even like developing my games in Thoria now is so well connected. 176 00:20:49.750 --> 00:21:02.950 Siraj Nazir: You know, there's a subtle way of doing it. So it's not to say not to. I think you should just not be like, you know, boasting about it, you know, it's like, Okay, I've done Xyz. I think now you're showing us so I don't know. What do you feel, Jenny? I don't think it's a resume type now. 177 00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:14.229 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's resume either. Yeah, I mean, like, you're not saying like, Oh, this is the best workshop ever like. You're just sa",
    "ying you hosted this workshop which you did so I don't think it's like braggy. 178 00:21:15.155 --> 00:21:19.719 Jenny Duan: Okay, this. That decision echoed in the women in games workshop. 179 00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.380 Jenny Duan: So maybe like 180 00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.830 Jenny Duan: I don't know what is. What do you think is a way that you can transition this. 181 00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:59.029 huda: Maybe like I can talk about like how I wasn't the only one who spotted like myself in the background. Maybe I like realized that there was people from like 46 international cities that all had, like a similar experience of, you know, like seeing themselves as like blurs in the sceneries, and they wanted to do something to change it, whether that be through like their development, whether that be through like their character design like 182 00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:14.460 huda: And I think that I don't know how to word it specifically for the transition. But I wanna mention how like like, I wasn't alone in like this realization that, like there was many people that felt like blurs in the background. I wanted to change that. I think. 183 00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.576 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's let's like, try to sum that in one sentence. 184 00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.800 Jenny Duan: yeah. 185 00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.870 Siraj Nazir: But I think I think there is a progression here. Right? I think I I get like 186 00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.700 Siraj Nazir: I think I'm kind of reading Jenny's point. 187 00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:42.349 Siraj Nazir: like you've actually set the stage for inspiring. You've already said that you're you're you're distributing your synthoria game, you know. If they go to extracurricular activities. They know you're doing that. 188 00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:48.670 Siraj Nazir: Maybe we should use this as an opportunity. See at the end of the day what is the theme and problem again, the way I'm understanding it. 189 00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.610 S",
    "iraj Nazir: it is still diversity and inclusion. That's really the main 190 00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:02.170 Siraj Nazir: key. I think. AI and data science and all that is just like to show that you know you don't have to be at the back end like you. You need to. I mean, you can also be the forefront 191 00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.249 Siraj Nazir: women in games is again part of the same team, because. 192 00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:25.760 Siraj Nazir: you know, it's another channel through which you're kind of doing the same advocacy. I don't know. How do you like? I think there's a better way to show like, you know, what have you done here? I think there you have developed a game, and you're actually fighting the same cause. And I don't know. Probably you're doing something else in women's in game like, I don't know like that's that's how I view. You know this 193 00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.150 Siraj Nazir: thing to be 194 00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:35.340 Siraj Nazir: maybe it's about scaling the impact, I don't know, like, you know. So there's probably some other aspect of your profile that can be brought up here. I don't know. 195 00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.740 huda: 3. 196 00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.040 Jenny Duan: See you? 197 00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.600 Jenny Duan: that they can. 198 00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:06.809 Jenny Duan: I'm thinking, something like, okay, this, I I think this doesn't sound good, but I'm just writing it down as a placeholder. 199 00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.700 Jenny Duan: My. 200 00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:22.679 Jenny Duan: it's like something like that is what I'm thinking like. Obviously, not this exact phrasing, because that sounds bad, but like 201 00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.149 Jenny Duan: something like that. 202 00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.770 huda: Yeah, I think. 203 00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.600 huda: mommy. 204 00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:41.519 huda: maybe like, so in synthoria, there's like, the future sun. And yes means 205 00:24:41.890 --> 00:25:01",
    ".140 huda: this is okay. I don't know if this will come across like correctly. But the future sun and yes, means can be like the forefront of technological innovation. But in this woman, in games workshop like these participants are going to be in the forefront of game development. And like, I guess 206 00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.830 huda: social change in video games. So maybe. Like. 207 00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.900 huda: yeah, I I think this is fine. But 208 00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.360 huda: yeah, maybe like. 209 00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.500 huda: yeah, I'm not great at transitions. 210 00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:27.830 Siraj Nazir: I have a question, Jenny, here like you know, what is the what is really the underlying goal of this whole point that we are trying to relay here. Right? 211 00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.939 Siraj Nazir: So we start with the problem statement 212 00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.349 Siraj Nazir: where Hudav is defining a problem statement that 213 00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.850 Siraj Nazir: there isn't that you know, diversity, and especially like women of color, or like, you know, they're not at the forefront. 214 00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.439 Siraj Nazir: And then she comes up with her. She starts, you know, framing her solution. 215 00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:52.500 Siraj Nazir: And one of the 1st things she does is she actually builds this game synthoria, which kind of you know, is one of the solutions. And then 216 00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.619 Siraj Nazir: I think then I think so. So so to me, like I'm looking at the core of it. 217 00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:06.739 Siraj Nazir: and and might be the other way to think about it is, Jenny, like I know, a few things were taken out right from your earlier version like, do you think that there's anything missing here like, you know which? 218 00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.390 Siraj Nazir: you know 219 00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:18.310 Siraj Nazir: it. It's a very you know, women in games is really very complemen",
    "tary to the same theme of solution, right? 220 00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:36.119 Siraj Nazir: Because in some ways you're actually showing that you're actually now having a global impact. She's talking about Algeria. She's talking about that. And then you say, Okay, Hey, I took it I developed a game. I started my journey, and might be. This is one of the other venues that I did the same thing, but it from that perspective. It's still a repetition, right? Because you're still within that same solution, theme 221 00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:43.390 Siraj Nazir: which is perfectly fine. But then there needs to be some nuance and depth to it if you're picking up only on one topic. 222 00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:48.289 Siraj Nazir: I I just don't want it to be seen, like you know, as another kind of 223 00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.010 Siraj Nazir: check like, you know, telling. Oh, I scaled the impact. I did. XYZ. 224 00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.400 Siraj Nazir: So. 225 00:26:54.890 --> 00:27:01.349 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that this is maybe a good way to transition it like this mission like making it your personal mission. 226 00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:10.510 Jenny Duan: This mission came to life through the women in games workshop. I later hosted. Representation meant different things for the participants in the participants. Respective countries. 227 00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.820 Jenny Duan: An artist. I noticed 228 00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.720 Jenny Duan: the same drive. 229 00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.570 Jenny Duan: Okay? 230 00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:27.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think the sentence maybe needs to be made smoother. 231 00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.130 huda: Yeah, I agree. 232 00:27:31.818 --> 00:27:35.649 Jenny Duan: In the end. Isn't life the ultimate game? 233 00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.629 Siraj Nazir: I I think that's your 234 00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.545 Siraj Nazir: previous 235 00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.969 Siraj Nazir: conclusion right? Because I think that doesn't go ",
    "well with the current one. 236 00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.969 huda: I think it still kind of works. 237 00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.520 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree. 238 00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.610 Siraj Nazir: Because you know you, I mean, you've taken me through a journey of you, basically going through this whole transformation and growth. 239 00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.309 Siraj Nazir: And you've come to a point where you're actually making an impact. 240 00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.060 Siraj Nazir: And now you're saying that 241 00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.530 Siraj Nazir: switching between roles, you know that kind of. 242 00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.169 Siraj Nazir: I just feel like 243 00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.550 Siraj Nazir: I've already like so much. I've submerged into your 244 00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.090 Siraj Nazir: yeah, acquiring new skills and facing unexpected challenges, switching between roles. So 245 00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.230 Siraj Nazir: well. 246 00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:43.879 huda: I think, since the I think it should maybe be parallel to the paragraph structure. Because acquiring new skills is like the 1st thing we learned that video games do to me, role players acquiring new skills. 247 00:28:44.208 --> 00:29:02.380 huda: switching between roles and facing unexpected challenges. Because that's the structure of the of the whole essay. It's like, 1st I learned about like my math problem, and then I talk about like switching from Urdu to English. And then the last one is facing unexpected challenges, which is like me realizing that oh, like video games 248 00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:04.350 huda: don't like represent me. 249 00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.940 huda: And then that's like kind of the structure 250 00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.150 huda: and 251 00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.649 huda: and I think this importance of representation could be changed. I agree. 252 00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.829 huda: but other than that, think 253 00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:21.4",
    "60 huda: it matches. 254 00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.579 Jenny Duan: I think there, I think this conclusion is good. 255 00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:26.889 huda: Are you sure like this? 256 00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.459 huda: The sentence is it? Do you think it's 257 00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.090 huda: cliche. 258 00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:33.860 Jenny Duan: I mean. 259 00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.639 huda: Or this part? 260 00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:42.289 Siraj Nazir: Connection, actually, you know, with the 1st word in the end isn't like the ultimate game like it's it's very abrupt. 261 00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:47.819 Siraj Nazir: See? As I leave through their pictures. I notice their ability to transform advocacy into engagement. 262 00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.980 Siraj Nazir: Correct? 263 00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 264 00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.350 Jenny Duan: I think the connection. 265 00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.420 Siraj Nazir: Connection is not. 266 00:29:56.725 --> 00:30:09.024 huda: Generally I could, just insisting, like in the life in the end. Isn't life the ultimate game? I think I shouldn't talk about like how other people are players and how they're acquiring skills. I could say that like, 267 00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:27.200 huda: my life is a game, and that like maybe maybe like the quest this entire time has been inspiring others, I think, like in a video game, how there's like a quest like an end goal. And like an ultimate thing like maybe mine could be like inspiring others. And I gained that through. 268 00:30:27.632 --> 00:30:31.340 huda: This like unexpected challenge, which is diversity, I think. 269 00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.279 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think so. The connector that I'm hearing is like looking back. 270 00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:46.159 Siraj Nazir: This is what like. So you've you've come to a point right that you started from, like probably 6, th 8th grade, 7th grade. And then you've come to a point where you're basically now 271 0",
    "0:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.529 Siraj Nazir: engaged at a at a global level. 272 00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.899 Siraj Nazir: So now you're basically concluding and say, Hey, looking back, you know. 273 00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.220 Siraj Nazir: So that kind of a connection. 274 00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.909 Jenny Duan: How's this? 275 00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.029 Jenny Duan: I just change it to, after all. 276 00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.579 Jenny Duan: instead of in the end. 277 00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.569 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. Now, it looks good. Yeah. Because, after all, like, yeah, at least like. 278 00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.880 Siraj Nazir: yeah, it's not very abrupt. 279 00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.050 Jenny Duan: Great. 280 00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:31.439 Jenny Duan: I think importance of representation is fine, because you talk so much about the importance of representation. 281 00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.350 huda: Hmm. 282 00:31:32.635 --> 00:31:37.779 Jenny Duan: I do think it's important, but if you think it sounds like Corny, we could change it, too. 283 00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.289 Jenny Duan: What do you think. 284 00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.264 huda: Hmm! 285 00:31:41.470 --> 00:32:03.969 huda: I think, because, like this, the the words before complexities of my identity that's pretty like cause I already talked about like the complexities of my identity. So that's why it can be vague. So then, I think, like, maybe importance of representation can also be vague, because these 2 things are already discussed in their own paragraph. So maybe I don't need to elaborate here. So yeah, I I think it's fine. Actually. 286 00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.350 Jenny Duan: Okay, you could also say something like, I don't know, like 287 00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:11.570 Jenny Duan: power of inclusion, or the power of representation, or something like that. 288 00:32:12.528 --> 00:32:14.280 Jenny Duan: I think it's like. 289 00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:22.550 huda: Oh, yeah. Cause then I ca",
    "n cause. Then also, like the workshop, showed like the power of representation. So I think that that's better. 290 00:32:23.837 --> 00:32:26.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that sounds good. 291 00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.190 Jenny Duan: So, Raj, were you saying something? Sorry. 292 00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:37.850 Siraj Nazir: I, I was thinking, might be my journey. Sorry for being so nosy today and interrupting so much because I I'm under a lot of stress from Huda. You know she's given me an ultimatum. 293 00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.949 Siraj Nazir: So I'm trying my luck here. I think 294 00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.860 Siraj Nazir: my feeling that. 295 00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:50.300 Siraj Nazir: after all, isn't like the ultimate game. I think it's good, but I would still say you're kind of coming up to, you know the end and the climax 296 00:32:50.687 --> 00:32:55.070 Siraj Nazir: which is also very important, because that's the memory you want to leave behind, you know, and 297 00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:59.239 Siraj Nazir: my journey through virtual words has prepared me like, isn't that a good way to start 298 00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.220 Siraj Nazir: like, because you're kind of saying, Hey, you literally have taken us through your entire journey. 299 00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.479 Siraj Nazir: Might be. It's just kind of swapping it with. 300 00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.830 Siraj Nazir: I don't know. 301 00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:17.990 Jenny Duan: I kind of like the question here, cause I feel like it makes the admissions officer like pause and like, think and then continue. 302 00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:23.730 Jenny Duan: I don't know, Huda, what are your thoughts? I feel like. If we put the question in the middle, it might get lost in the paragraph. 303 00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.139 Siraj Nazir: Okay, okay, that's fine. 304 00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.319 Jenny Duan: But I don't know, Huda, what are your thoughts? 305 00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:37.789 huda: I think this sentence, ",
    "my journey through virtual worlds is prepared for the complexities of my identity and power of representation. I think that's a like a good concluding like sentence. I 306 00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:42.555 huda: like you said like I feel like this 1st question is kind of like 307 00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.579 huda: like intriguing, I guess a little bit and also 308 00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:55.069 huda: also, like this part. It sounds I I mean, like it's so important. But I feel like it sounds kind of too generic to like, start off the paragraph with. 309 00:33:56.858 --> 00:33:59.890 Siraj Nazir: Might be that I'm I'm I'm kind of 310 00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:06.430 Siraj Nazir: just reading it without reading the entire thing. And you guys probably remember the entire essay much better. So it's perfectly fine. 311 00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:13.950 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is like already. Much better. Let's look at the feedback, the specific feedback again, and then go from there. 312 00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:19.010 Jenny Duan: So 1st thing, avoid listing achievements. Let's see, at 16. 313 00:34:19.564 --> 00:34:24.390 Jenny Duan: This is like fixed by this. I think that's like, not a problem anymore. 314 00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.379 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to talk about mentors, families, etc. I just. 315 00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:34.829 Jenny Duan: I don't think that's like so relevant to your story because it's not like you had like a professor you were working with, or something. So I think 316 00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.900 Jenny Duan: this is like fine 317 00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.749 Siraj Nazir: That's why I did not tag you guys on that. I mean. 318 00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe this like the challenges that you faced. 319 00:34:45.092 --> 00:34:49.810 Jenny Duan: Here, you, I think it's clear now, like what challenge you are facing. 320 00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.520 Jenny Duan: So I feel like that got resolved. 321 00:34:52",
    ".739 --> 00:34:54.100 Jenny Duan: This? 322 00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:00.460 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine because you you talk about their specific specifics. 323 00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:05.919 Jenny Duan: And then, I think, did you get rid of this. I think you got rid of this statement. 324 00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.090 Jenny Duan: Sentence. 325 00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:12.270 Siraj Nazir: I mean that that was not a strong statement. Anyways, I agree, like, there's there's nothing complex about it to be honest. 326 00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.620 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 327 00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:21.621 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. And and the other ones are the same. You know. This was just like across verification that independently like both both of 328 00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:28.450 Siraj Nazir: I think the do's are excellent lot of great things came out of and these, by the way, Jenny, these do's and don'ts 329 00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:33.590 Siraj Nazir: are not based on just essays. These are based on admission officer analysis. 330 00:35:34.024 --> 00:35:41.070 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I've taken that framework. We have basically provision that framework into our our private data. 331 00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:47.869 Siraj Nazir: And I ran that. So they applied the same thing right where I mean again, there's never like a perfect essay, right? So. 332 00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:48.490 Jenny Duan: Of course. 333 00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:56.290 Siraj Nazir: Do's and do's are, yeah, this is perfect one thing yeah. So I think awesome. This is great. One thing I had was like, because 334 00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:18.139 Siraj Nazir: Huda kept telling me that, hey, Jenny, you know, insisted a lot to add like AI data science. And so I think we've kind of removed that now, right? Because, you see, like AI data, science has no more. The center like that's not the central theme. The central theme is really about her identity, her experience, which is fine. I've seen many essays that absolutely don't talk abou",
    "t anything to do with major 335 00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:23.820 Siraj Nazir: amazing essays, you know, and including last year's, admits at Stanford Harvard as well. 336 00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:31.480 Siraj Nazir: So I'll I'll leave it up to you like if you think there's an there's something that really makes this week in terms of the majors. Then why not. 337 00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.749 Jenny Duan: I don't think so. I think this sounds really good. 338 00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:49.949 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think the next the steps, I think, Huda, let's have you read this out loud one more time, and then after that, I think by the end of today's session we should aim to be finalized, because at the end of the day like there, I mean. Obviously, an essay can always be improved 339 00:36:50.070 --> 00:37:17.280 Jenny Duan: every single time you read it, but at some point there are diminishing returns, and like just looking at one essay over and over, because an admissions officer is only going to look at it for Max 5 min. And so you don't want to have like one perfect essay, and then, like the rest of your application, not have the same amount of attention. So I think, like, once we finalize this, we can kind of move on, because at the end of the day, like your own, your admissions officer is going to spend like 5 min on this. So as long as it's like 340 00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.040 Jenny Duan: represents you, and it's like to the best of your ability. We don't need to like. 341 00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.130 Jenny Duan: I think, spend even more time making like 342 00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:29.290 Jenny Duan: very, very minute changes with a lot of time when we could spend that on other things. 343 00:37:29.805 --> 00:37:30.180 Jenny Duan: That's. 344 00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.419 Siraj Nazir: Mean, just recently. 345 00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:45.510 huda: I need to work on like the additional information, just like, make sure, like I know, like how to approach that one as well a",
    "s like, I wanted to just like double check. If, like, my activities are fine for like 346 00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.860 huda: for submitting, because Unc is actually due in 2 days. So 347 00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:54.021 huda: yeah. And then, like, yeah. So I think I'll just I'll start reading it. 348 00:37:54.540 --> 00:38:00.040 Siraj Nazir: Quick question, Jenny, I mean, can this se be altered at all like after submitting it once. 349 00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:17.329 Jenny Duan: Yes, you can alter it every single time, like every time you submit the comment app, it's basically like frozen in time. So like once you submit it, it sends your common app as it is in that moment, but then, if you make new edits, it'll send like a new common app to every school, so you can still edit stuff after you submit it to Unc. 350 00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.420 Siraj Nazir: Wow! I didn't know that. Oh, it's not like uc, okay. 351 00:38:23.029 --> 00:38:27.299 Jenny Duan: yeah, so like, every time you submit this. Oh, go ahead. Sorry, to interrupt. 352 00:38:27.881 --> 00:38:34.150 huda: Just like a random update. I was actually thinking of applying early to Urbana champagne, too. 353 00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.639 Jenny Duan: No, and right. 354 00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:37.360 huda: Sorry. 355 00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.330 Jenny Duan: No essays. 356 00:38:39.155 --> 00:38:45.490 huda: There's 3, but they're they're a lot more direct, and I think they're just like one of those like Y major essays. 357 00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.889 Jenny Duan: Sure. I mean, I think, like the biggest thing is, as long as your teachers can send in their Recs, it doesn't really matter how. 358 00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.149 huda: And actually, Barney Rex, that's also a good thing. 359 00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.639 Jenny Duan: Perfect. Okay, then, so northeastern in urban champagne, then 360 00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:00.730 Jenny Duan: 2. 361 00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.380 huda: Yeah. 362 00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:09.470",
    " huda: northeastern, I'm just gonna submit. I'm gonna submit it regular decision. But it's pretty much right now, because it's I'm pretty sure it's a private. 363 00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:16.110 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's private. And also, I think, no essays. So yeah, nice. 364 00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:26.259 Siraj Nazir: Okay, guys, thank you very much. I'm all good. So I think that works for me. With that I promise I won't give any more comments on this. Okay, take care. Might be until next submission. Not for this time. 365 00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.980 Siraj Nazir: bye. 366 00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.710 Jenny Duan: Sure. Yeah, thanks a lot. 367 00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:29.880 Jenny Duan: Bye. 368 00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:39.290 Jenny Duan: yeah, actually had, I felt like his feedback was really helpful, like, I think it's like good to get multiple eyes on this essay, because, like, since, we're reading it so much like. 369 00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:46.430 Jenny Duan: we might not notice things that, like other people, might, too. And I think you should still have your sister read it again, and like, see if she has any comments too. 370 00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:50.240 huda: I was definitely a bit frustrated in the beginning, because, like some of the changes were like. 371 00:39:50.280 --> 00:40:01.049 huda: I had to change a large portion of it. But then, like, I kind of just focused on like one aspect of it, and it kind of made it a little easier for me to like implement those changes. But yeah. 372 00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:05.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely. Okay, can you read this out loud? One more time, and then we should be able to move on. 373 00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:24.050 huda: By 8 Pm. I've baked 10 cakes, fed my sheep, discovered diamonds the next hour I'm managing a pizza franchise generating a 7 figure income at 7 a budding entrepreneur. If only my parents knew about my lucrative virtual empires, they might have reconsidered my allowance. 374 00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:3",
    "9.969 huda: When I 1st picked up the ipad my sister and I shared. I didn't know it would offer me much more than its 3,145,728 pixels instead, it became a lens through which I learned to decode the real world. We don't just play video games. They play us, too. 375 00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:53.089 huda: When I solved a complex Redstone circuit in Minecraft, an automatic farm that resembled the one on the way to the grocery store. It wasn't just the game's mechanics that mattered. It was my statistics homework. That night 376 00:40:53.230 --> 00:41:01.970 huda: when, faced with a tricky, graphing problem, I approached it with the same strategy, step by step, like placing redstone components. I plotted analytics on the axes. 377 00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:08.540 huda: Even this past summer at Data Science Camp. I saw Redstone every time I fed data into regression models. 378 00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:21.489 huda: People praise games for the immersive experiences, but they often miss the point. It's how we carry that immersion into the real real world that matters how it bleeds into our decision, making our approaches to solving problems. 379 00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:28.080 huda: Soon it became routine, switching from a gladiator to a manager faster than you can press. Alt tab. 380 00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:38.220 huda: Perhaps it's this same innate ability that allows me to switch between Urdu and English without a second thought or from technical jargon at hackathons, to advocacy, at journalism conferences. 381 00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:54.100 huda: Each role comes with its own set of expectations and rules of engagement. Who am I, when not bound to one narrative, one language, or one role? And yet behind all the role switching and analytical skills I gained from games. There was one thing I had lost my individuality. 382 00:41:54.390 --> 00:42:00.389 huda: One evening, while playing assassin's creed, I spotted a woman, brown skinned, with surma in her eyes like me. 383 00:42:00.580 --",
    "> 00:42:05.470 huda: hidden in the background, selling fruit at a bazaar, a mere blur in the scenery. 384 00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:18.589 huda: characters who looked like me always, were always the ones I passed by, nameless and insignificant. I had learned to thrive in roles. Games provided me, but now, I ask myself, can games thrive in the roles? I provide them? 385 00:42:20.907 --> 00:42:23.589 huda: Wait! I meant to italicize this. 386 00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.984 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's exactly what we have to do. The read the final read over. 387 00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:30.484 huda: Yeah. 388 00:42:31.306 --> 00:42:42.799 huda: Developing my game synthoria. I dragged myself to the forefront. The protagonists, Sana and Yasmin aren't commodified. Instead, they're fighting AI bias reprogramming rogue robots and leading social change. 389 00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:47.629 huda: The protagonists are no longer nameless. Instead, they have loud Muslim names. 390 00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:54.450 huda: games, asks us to become someone else. All the time I've played as a detective raccoon and an Nba all-star. 391 00:42:54.570 --> 00:43:13.129 huda: Through them I hope to inspire the future Sana and Yasmins of the world to see that they can also be the forefront of technological innovation. This mission came to life with a women in games workshop. I later hosted. Representation meant different things in the participants respective countries. While a developer from Algeria argued 392 00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:20.630 huda: for for deradicalization in call of duty. An artist from France combated the submissive depiction of women. 393 00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:39.450 huda: I recognize the same drive, to step off the sidelines that I once felt with Synthoria. As I leafed through their pitches, I saw how they skillfully transformed advocacy into meaningful engagement. After all, isn't life the ultimate game? We're all players acquiring new skills, switching between roles and facing unexpect",
    "ed challenges. 394 00:43:39.530 --> 00:44:03.419 huda: My journey through virtual worlds has prepared me for the complexities of my identity and the power of representation. As I look to the future, I see myself continuing to bridge worlds in technology and culture and society, whether it's through game development, creating websites or crafting content that resonates with other women in tech. I hope to design experiences where everyone can level up regardless of their starting stats. All you have to do is press play. 395 00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.300 Jenny Duan: Yay. 396 00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:18.059 Jenny Duan: okay. Great. Okay. Now you you already know it's good. Let's not waste any more time on this essay or not waste. But let's not spend any more time on this. Let's go to your common app activities list. 397 00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:23.500 Jenny Duan: I believe I have it. Can you share a link in the chat, so I can find that right now. 398 00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:29.099 Jenny Duan: and I already looked at it, and I think it looks good. But I would like to. 399 00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:43.370 huda: That's an additional thing. I actually I was talking with one of my friends that I met at J. Camp, and she was writing her activities as well, and so for the organizations that she started. She added, like a semicolon, and described like kind of what it is. 400 00:44:43.657 --> 00:45:03.199 huda: She said, that it's because, like sometimes admissions officers like don't understand like what the project is. So it's like a quick little explanation. But I'm not sure like, if I need that or like, I can just cause I felt like just to clarify that like, it's an initiative that I found it, because people might be wondering like, Oh, like, what is this? So 401 00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.949 huda: I mean, I'm not sure. But yeah. 402 00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.650 Jenny Duan: If you have the word, count for it. 403 00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.000 Jenny Duan: Like, Yeah, that's good. 404",
    " 00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:09.590 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 405 00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:10.180 huda: Yeah. 406 00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.829 Jenny Duan: Same with Indoria, I think would be good. 407 00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:24.910 Jenny Duan: Like, I think, for Filmmakers Club. You don't need to, because, like they understand, that's a school club or J. Camp. You don't need like some of these, but for for folklift I would do the same. 408 00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:27.999 Jenny Duan: Put it, classy is fine. Women in games is fine. 409 00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.030 Jenny Duan: This is fine. 410 00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.370 Jenny Duan: This is like 411 00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.530 Jenny Duan: fun. 412 00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.189 Jenny Duan: I think, just for synthoria empowering AI and folklift. 413 00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:37.730 Jenny Duan: Be good 414 00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:47.640 huda: Should I mention like, I mean, I think the essays already mentioned like things about like the representation. So I shouldn't mention anything about like 415 00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:56.110 huda: that. But like with Cynthoria like, I'm not really sure like how else to describe it without like restating what the 1st bullet point is. 416 00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.620 Jenny Duan: Oh, then I think you don't need anything for Synthoria. 417 00:46:04.445 --> 00:46:04.820 huda: Folk. 418 00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:15.270 Jenny Duan: I think it's I think it's best. If you are able to like, put this in the information you would put here in the description, but I think like if it doesn't fit in the description, then you can put in the title. 419 00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.474 huda: because and then vocal could just be like 420 00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:23.460 huda: nonprofit 421 00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:25.689 huda: Gazette. 422 00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.570 huda: highlighting 423 00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.506 huda: minority stories, 424 00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:38.289 huda: stories from minorities. 425 00:46:46.800 --> 0",
    "0:46:50.749 huda: Okay, yeah. That fits the word count or character count. 426 00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.740 Jenny Duan: Okay. 427 00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.240 Jenny Duan: can you say, like. 428 00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:08.750 Jenny Duan: can you? 429 00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.179 Jenny Duan: Somewhere in Jcamp, can you like emphasize? It's a summer? 430 00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.730 Jenny Duan: Oh, here is this one week summer program. 431 00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:16.490 huda: And also. 432 00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.909 Jenny Duan: You can write that it's summer program, or if you don't have words, it's fine, too. 433 00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.284 huda: Yeah, no, actually in 434 00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:30.990 huda: and like, when I'm putting it into the common app, it asks if it's like, during school or during a school break. 435 00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:32.450 huda: Oh, so I 436 00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:40.210 huda: school break, and then I and then I did it in 12th grade and I spent a hundred hours per week. And then I spent one week. So 437 00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:41.560 huda: great. Okay? 438 00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.700 huda: And 439 00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:56.048 huda: oh, yeah. And then I think I think, like in the actual common app, I put the 440 00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.240 huda: I put the 441 00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:04.180 huda: podcast club as like journalism and publications. Rather than 442 00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:05.670 huda: or actually, I was. 443 00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:18.529 huda: I think, this is the one that I was confused about if I wanted to do put it as oh, no. Independent was the one where I was confused. If I wanted to put it as computer slash technology or community service, volunteer. 444 00:48:22.435 --> 00:48:25.230 Jenny Duan: I think maybe computer science technology. 445 00:48:27.376 --> 00:48:28.190 huda: For independent. 446 00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.499 Jenny Duan: For independent. Yeah. 447 00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:31.640 huda: Okay. 448 00:",
    "48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.410 Jenny Duan: And is there like another? 449 00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.650 Jenny Duan: Okay. 450 00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.170 Jenny Duan: For the position? Is this something you can write in yourself? Yes, right. 451 00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.370 huda: Yeah. 452 00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.430 Jenny Duan: I don't. Is this what what does this 1% mean? 1% of locals. 453 00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.940 huda: Kind of like 300 locals. 454 00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.679 Jenny Duan: I feel like is not a compelling number. 455 00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:15.260 huda: Yes, that's what I was thinking when I was like talking with my, Danny said, like 3 people got the job from like the website. So like, that's pretty big deal. I don't know. 456 00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.910 huda: Yeah. 457 00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:19.839 huda: I don't think. 458 00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:34.820 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like, I think this sounds better than this, like I think, like reading this, you're like, Oh, you're helping 300 locals. But then, if you say like, only 1% get jobs, it's like, it's like them like back to back, I think, is, the doesn't sound quite right. So is there another thing you could write. 459 00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.580 huda: Maybe like 460 00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:48.830 huda: like on a different note, like some other freelancing that I've done. I think. 461 00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 462 00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.650 huda: I mean, like I've I think, like 463 00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:58.199 huda: I don't know. I don't really think like hackathons count, but because I don't really do freelancing that much. But. 464 00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:00.500 Jenny Duan: Oh. 465 00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.019 Jenny Duan: we could talk about hackathons! 466 00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.050 Jenny Duan: Why not? 467 00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.909 huda: Kind of like, quantify it, or like 468 00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.970 huda: I haven't done a hack on in some time, so I d",
    "on't know like how that. 469 00:50:14.746 --> 00:50:16.299 Jenny Duan: In hackathons 470 00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:22.740 Jenny Duan: alongside college students, high school students, girls, what? What does your team formation look like. 471 00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:33.129 huda: Yeah, it's usually like college students, like women usually, and like, sometimes it was through like women hackathons. But then sometimes it was just like. 472 00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:35.160 huda: Yeah. 473 00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.499 Jenny Duan: Competing college hackathons. I think that's good. 474 00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:39.830 Jenny Duan: Okay? 475 00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:47.859 Jenny Duan: And it's under. Or you could say, build at college hackathons. But I think compete also sounds fine. 476 00:50:50.521 --> 00:50:53.589 huda: I think I'll do compete. Maybe. 477 00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:54.550 Jenny Duan: Okay. 478 00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.059 huda: Building, app building, app better. 479 00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:58.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 480 00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.170 Jenny Duan: you can just choose whatever word you think is best. But I think 481 00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:09.199 Jenny Duan: this is super impressive. I'm so happy, Huda, like I feel like. 482 00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:17.880 Jenny Duan: like I think I remember when we 1st like started meeting, like we really struggled, getting all these numbers right for all their activities. But like 483 00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:24.900 Jenny Duan: now that you see everything here like it looks so impressive when it's on paper, you know, like, and all your hard work is coming to an end. 484 00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:54.099 huda: I think some things that I just like I never really considered like, like, especially for Filmmakers Club, like increasing membership by that number, was like, I did like the math from like the year I wasn't president. And the year that I was president, and I was like, Okay, well, I actually made a change and and then, like the",
    " second bit, we're like reaching like 2.5 K students weekly, because it's shown like every classroom, and like what I'm doing. It just doesn't feel like that many people. But like now, quantifying, it feels really strange. 485 00:51:54.750 --> 00:52:00.709 Jenny Duan: This is so good, I'm so happy. Do you have a copy of your Awards list? Maybe we could go through that too. 486 00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:05.230 huda: Yeah, I just I didn't write it on here. I I think I'll 487 00:52:06.138 --> 00:52:09.479 huda: I I can just do it on the same, Doc. I'll put it underneath. 488 00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.000 Jenny Duan: Okay. Why don't you do that right now? 489 00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.199 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to like write descriptions. I think you just write the award names. 490 00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:19.827 huda: It's actually just like the same thing that I sent you. 491 00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:21.510 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. 492 00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:24.570 huda: Let me paste that here. 493 00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:37.300 huda: and also with additional information. I was wondering like, how I'm supposed to go about writing that. 494 00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.500 Jenny Duan: I think this looks good. 495 00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:57.909 Jenny Duan: I feel like these awards. Look good to me. I don't think you don't need to write anything else right besides the title of the Awards. 496 00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.600 huda: Yeah, just what grade you receive them. And then like, what level. 497 00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:03.389 Jenny Duan: Yeah, these look good 498 00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.330 Jenny Duan: national, national, international, International, School. 499 00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.970 Jenny Duan: National National. 500 00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.820 Jenny Duan: But the International. First, st I would say. 501 00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:20.440 Jenny Duan: and then put the school one last, I would say, also. 502 00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.560 Jenny Duan: great 503 00",
    ":53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.718 Jenny Duan: cool. I think this is all approved, if you want to submit, your 504 00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:35.430 Jenny Duan: you are you no, you are using its assays. 505 00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:36.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 506 00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:37.780 Jenny Duan: I think 507 00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:42.139 Jenny Duan: like for the Unc. One I feel like. 508 00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:49.639 Jenny Duan: let me look at your essays one more time. Let's go over that. And I feel like. If that's done, you can just submit the Unc. Tonight. If you want to. 509 00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:54.219 huda: Wait. So with the Additional Information Section, because I. 510 00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.430 Jenny Duan: Oh, thanks for reminding me about that. 511 00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:21.227 Jenny Duan: That's 1 thing we talk about. Sorry. Sorry I forgot. Yes, we need to talk about that. Can you make a new document? And like? Or if you already have a document for your additional information section, can you share that with me? And then I'll briefly talk you through what that looks like. So for your additional information section, I think the key here is going to be to highlight like economic adversity that your family has experienced. And this will be really, really helpful for 512 00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:26.180 Jenny Duan: yeah, like your admissions. So I think, like 513 00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:32.675 Jenny Duan: in unc specifically, I know you don't have any like information about 514 00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:56.679 Jenny Duan: about economic adversities. So maybe you can write that in additional information. So I think you only need to write a short paragraph so like, don't write like you don't need to write like a sob story. You're not trying to like, you know, like, write an essay. You're just trying like it doesn't have to be a story is what I'm saying. I think it should just be like information. 515 00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.460 Jenny Duan: we can say like. 516 00:55:00.",
    "620 --> 00:55:01.600 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! 517 00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:27.159 huda: So should I like mention, like last time I went with like additional information for Jcamp I talked about like when my parents were cause also, like last year's tax returns like it doesn't like accurately show that, like both of my parents were unemployed, but like so like, I don't know if it would reflect in like this, too. So I can just explain that like like they were unemployed this year, or like last year. And then. 518 00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:28.559 huda: like, I guess. 519 00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:30.879 huda: do I talk about like how it's affected me? 520 00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:37.910 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, basically, you could write what you wrote for J. Camp, and like, how that's affected you and like, affected your learning. 521 00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.490 huda: Yeah, let me just actually copy and paste what I put there and then just change it. 522 00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:48.230 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like again, I don't. It doesn't need to be any storytelling. You're just like delivering information to them 523 00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.190 Jenny Duan: that can. 524 00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:15.739 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say, like this financial crisis has challenged my 525 00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.220 huda: My access to some expensive resources, maybe. 526 00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:27.309 Jenny Duan: To. Yeah, my access to expensive educational programs and 527 00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:30.409 Jenny Duan: has inspired. Maybe you can talk about like. 528 00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:37.119 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is necessary. But I'm just gonna put out there. You decide if it's necessary. You can say like has inspired me to create 529 00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:52.989 Jenny Duan: my own education or like create organizations that, like pioneer education advocacy, because, like the one thing that you want to justify is, it's true that you're not really a part of any like national ",
    "orgs or national organizations, because you're like working on your own stuff. So like 530 00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.900 Jenny Duan: like, you're also not part of like mock trial, or like model UN or anything. And so like. 531 00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.459 Jenny Duan: yeah, you've like, chosen to create your own opportunities. 532 00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 533 00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:07.650 Jenny Duan: resources for others. Similar 534 00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:09.470 Jenny Duan: situations. 535 00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.260 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say, like, I think. 536 00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:26.720 Jenny Duan: like the food stamps thing you should really emphasize. You could say, like, today, I am still on like I'm still the recipient of Cal you mentioned, like I don't remember the name of it like the Cal thing, and then you can say like. 537 00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.329 huda: Should I place that here. 538 00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.229 Jenny Duan: No, I think you should place it after you write about what you've done. 539 00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:38.239 Jenny Duan: Cause then it's like, it's like, you're sandwiching what you've done. Yeah. 540 00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:49.280 Jenny Duan: Or you can say I continue to receive, or I'm receiving something like that. 541 00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:12.990 huda: Hmm! 542 00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:15.995 huda: Why, 543 00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:19.160 huda: maybe like 544 00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:20.830 huda: while these 545 00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:23.000 huda: why, like. 546 00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.841 huda: actually, I don't know what I was. Gonna say, 547 00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:40.020 huda: is this just like one look at the additional information goes out to the call colleges, so could I end up with something like, I hope to like 548 00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.580 huda: like 549 00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.159 huda: like. Use your campus as like 550 00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.920 huda: my 551 00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:5",
    "2.260 huda: or like utilize it despite like all these things, maybe I don't know. 552 00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.029 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that's redundant. 553 00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.180 huda: Hmm. 554 00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.124 huda: I think it's 555 00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.649 huda: yeah, I think this is. 556 00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.750 huda: This sentence is fine. 557 00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.110 huda: Hmm. 558 00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.680 Jenny Duan: I think that I think like this is all you really need to write. I don't think you need to write more than that. 559 00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.030 huda: Can I mention like like being like a family of 5. 560 00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:53.890 Jenny Duan: How's that? 561 00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.709 huda: Okay. But do you it looks. 562 00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:59.379 Jenny Duan: Maybe in the beginning, too. 563 01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.220 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 564 01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.709 huda: Yeah. Over here. 565 01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:06.370 Jenny Duan: How's that? 566 01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.060 huda: That was great 567 01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.510 huda: and. 568 01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:29.419 Jenny Duan: You don't have to write as a software engineer, because people know that engineers in the Bay area make money. So you don't need to write that. 569 01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.040 huda: Hmm. 570 01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:39.970 huda: okay. And like, is there anything? I I think that's like the most important part that I have to address and additional information. But 571 01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.650 huda: yeah, like, I don't know if there's anything else I should 572 01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.980 huda: mention. 573 01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:47.420 Jenny Duan: I think this is all. I think that looks good. 574 01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.010 huda: I agree. 575 01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.379 huda: and I'll put that into call. 576 01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.930 Jenny Duan: Do you wanna look at here. 577 01:00:58",
    ".377 --> 01:01:00.350 Jenny Duan: new and Csa's 578 01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:07.349 Jenny Duan: has your dad looked at these. 579 01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:11.190 huda: No, he says he doesn't. He doesn't really like 580 01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:18.279 huda: I mean, like he didn't say like this way, he said. He doesn't really care if it's like not too like 581 01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.240 huda: ivy level. You described it, but 582 01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.412 Jenny Duan: This is Unc. 583 01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:34.240 Jenny Duan: okay, that's fine. But Unc is important because they have that scholarship program which is like, I don't think you should go to Unc unless you're a like Robertson scholar, or like the other 584 01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.840 Jenny Duan: scholarship. 585 01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:37.060 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 586 01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:39.519 Jenny Duan: But I do think these essays are good. I think 587 01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:42.050 Jenny Duan: we've looked at these several times. I think. 588 01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:48.139 Jenny Duan: to the extent that you think these essays are good. I think you can be ready to submit it whenever 589 01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:57.520 Jenny Duan: you think they're good. I think they're good, but I think you should think they're good. So whenever you think they're ready, I think like it's approved by me. Whenever you want. 590 01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.350 huda: Yeah, I 591 01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.469 huda: I think 592 01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.589 huda: I think they're great. I don't. It's okay. So for Number 2, and it's 593 01:02:07.847 --> 01:02:10.649 huda: talking about like curiosity, I guess. 594 01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:11.750 huda: Oh. 595 01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:18.929 huda: do you think it's like it was correct to I guess. Like name specific things at 596 01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.730 huda: unc like resources. 597 01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's great. 598 01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:27.450 huda: Okay",
    ". And I think I'm gonna put this in quote. So it's 599 01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.450 huda: more clear. 600 01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.640 huda: And this is 601 01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:35.390 huda: okay. 602 01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.040 huda: Then I think that's like the entire application. Then. 603 01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.170 Jenny Duan: Oh. 604 01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.720 Jenny Duan: okay, I think whenever you're ready you can. 605 01:02:46.280 --> 01:03:00.690 Jenny Duan: I think if you want, you can have your dad look over like everything. If you. If you want to see the activities list or the Awards list, maybe he can look over that, or the Additional information section, or your sister, or like anyone. But I think, like, whenever you're ready, you could submit this, and this will be your 1st submission. 606 01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:08.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so exciting also. Oh, see if you can get fee waivers for all of your applications. 607 01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:25.349 huda: Yeah, I in common app, like, there's like a 1 of like the I guess, like tabs is like the fee waiver. And I've like applied for it. And I think my counselor has to give like my like financial, like information to the colleges. So 608 01:03:26.276 --> 01:03:30.119 huda: yeah, I don't think that's like. I don't think I have to submit anything yet. 609 01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:37.670 Jenny Duan: Alright like. Just make sure you have fee waivers, because qualifications are so expensive, for no reason like 610 01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:43.870 Jenny Duan: they're way too expensive. So get your fee waivers and save money and like, buy Boba instead, or something like, Yeah. 611 01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:57.130 Jenny Duan: and yeah, I think I'm so happy I I think you're ready to submit.

    "hese, I think, moving forward just like 613 01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:20.469 Jenny Duan: a laundry list of like things that still need to get done are approving the Stanford supplements. I think the uiuc supplements, because we're adding those, even though those, I think, could probably be reused from other essays. And then the Uc supplements. Right? These are like the main 3 top of mind things at the moment. Right? 614 01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:21.470 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 615 01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.050 Jenny Duan: Okay, when do you want to meet next. 616 01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.190 huda: We can meet maybe, like 617 01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.360 huda: Tuesday.

You should be so proud of yourself. 624 01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:06.060 huda: Yeah, I just I really wanted to thank you. Because, like, I think the 1st time that, like my dad connected us over that call. I think I just genuinely knew that, like you'd be able to help me because 625 01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:15.400 huda: I don't know. I just I felt like really inspired by you and I just like felt like really lost before, and I didn't really know where I was going. And now I feel like. 626 01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:22.389 huda: well, like all this guidance. It's it's been so great and like I don't. I don't think I would have done any of this without you, so. 627 01:05:22.663 --> 01:05:38.550 Jenny Duan: We did this together, and like, I think, like the brilliant part is just like seeing how far you've come and like to be honest like colleg",
    "e applications are just like it's like just the final thing. But like you've already done all of the work to like, get here. And at the end of the day, like 628 01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:45.620 Jenny Duan: like you've done so much hard work. You're gonna end up going to an amazing school like I'm just so excited to see like where you end up. And like. 629 01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:52.570 Jenny Duan: I think at this point it's just like, See reaping the benefits of like all your hard work, you know. So yeah. 630 01:05:52.870 --> 01:06:03.290 Jenny Duan: congrats again. And also like, just don't be so stressed on. I think another piece of unwarranted advice. Maybe it's like, don't be so stressed like, don't place all your heart and soul into like 631 01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:15.260 Jenny Duan: one place, because, like I think, like, it will all sort itself out, and you'll like end up where you need to be and like you're gonna end up going to an amazing school like you already know that. So just like sit back and like, let like 632 01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:19.530 Jenny Duan: the universe, you know, like play play out how it's meant to be. 633 01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:21.860 huda: Thank you so much. 634 01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:27.760 Jenny Duan: Alright.
