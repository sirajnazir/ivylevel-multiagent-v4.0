How are you? 3 00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.959 Jenny Duan: I'm good. I'm good. 4 00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.570 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. 5 00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:43.940 Ivy Mentors: just waiting for Huda. Thanks. yeah, I think we can. Probably I'll like, I mean, if it's okay, like, we can probably do an hour today, like, you know, if you have time like, I would love to have like a few more sessions. If that's okay. 6 00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.649 Ivy Mentors: because I also like, there's something that which I wanted to kind of connect with you on. So let's just focus on Hudana. And then 7 00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:05.830 Ivy Mentors: sure, sure, no problem. So an hour for who that today, instead of 450, no, I mean for us, I said. 45, or even like an hour, is fine. I mean, I think it depends on the sat and other things that she has. So I will let you talk. Then I'll probably just like 8 00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.659 Ivy Mentors: jump in in the middle, like for the sad thing. 9 00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.030 Ivy Mentors: But yeah, please get started. 10 00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.090 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Hi, hooda, how's it going? 11 00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.240 sameeha siraj: Hi! It's going good! How are you? 12 00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.560 Jenny Duan: I'm good. I was thinking 13 00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:38.649 Jenny Duan: So I was talking to your dad. And he said that we could do a little bit more focus on sat today. So I was thinking, we could just do updates really quickly, because they still just wanna hear what you've been up to? But then, after that, we can just focus on doing sat for the rest of the session. How does that sound to you? That sounds great. 14 00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.190 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. So, yeah, just 15 00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.490 Jenny Duan: what are some of your updates? 16 00:01:45.100 --> 00:02:11.450 sameeha siraj: Essay? And we'll we'll talk about that in our second session this week. So I just wanna make sure that you know, I haven't forgotten that I've seen that we'll talk about that later. But yeah, go ahead. Yeah. So I made like the first draft for the essay, and I got like the video editing program downloaded on this computer. And I was actually just editing it before this 17 00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.240 sameeha siraj: and then 18 00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:24.769 sameeha siraj: I guess I I'm planning like my first meeting for Filmmakers Club. And like we're making the slideshow and stuff so that we can hold it this week. And then 19 00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.310 sameeha siraj: I think 20 00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.459 sameeha siraj: I haven't been able to like film any of the interviews yet, but I think my first one is gonna be in like 21 00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.909 sameeha siraj: next to next weekend 22 00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:47.050 sameeha siraj: and I think we started working on like the slideshow for our 23 00:02:47.470 --> 00:03:07.799 sameeha siraj: for empowering AI, and like, we're about like 10 slides in we just kind of finish like the foundational like, what is computer science like, why should you be learning this like, what are we doing? And we plan like a cahoot that we're gonna make at the end, which is kinda like quizzing on like python 24 00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.580 sameeha siraj: and stuff. So, yeah. 25 00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.369 Jenny Duan: okay, this is all awesome. I have a question about folklift. How is the progress on the website looking like the Folklift website. 26 00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.250 sameeha siraj: I think we need to put more time into that actually, cause I haven't been able to work on it at all much. 27 00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.689 sameeha siraj: I think I'm kind of struggling like in the creation of it, cause I don't know how to make it like I guess. 28 00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.269 sameeha siraj: like more flexible and stuff, because I've just been making it using like HTML, css, in Javascript. 29 00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.430 But I feel like I should be using more complicated things which is kinda like holding me back. 30 00:03:49.330 --> 00:04:06.909 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you should try. I think you should look into react I think, react. Js, is, it's I mean, it's basically just Javascript. But react is like a lot more responsive to work with. And what I like personally about react is it's 31 00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:22.419 Jenny Duan: it's good for Mobile and for web, because I know a lot of HTML, Css. Javascript. Is not that good for Mobile like with the spacing and everything you need to add a lot of Flexbox and and all of that. But I think for react if you build it. 32 00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:32.440 Jenny Duan: it it's more responsive for webin mobile. So you should look into that, and it's not too hard to learn. I don't think, especially if you already know. HTML javascript and css. 33 00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.859 Jenny Duan: so I'll just look. I'll just make a note on that. 34 00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:59.149 sameeha siraj: Oh, also I had a question about early college, so I was wondering, should I sign up for, like an articulate course, which I kinda accounts for. High school credits that way. I'll have like high school credits out of the way, and I could take more Ap's next year. So I was like wondering if I should take I think English ap 35 00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:09.850 sameeha siraj: this summer. Or not. Summer, I think spring semester, so that so that way, like, I'll have that credit, those credits out of the way, and then I'll be able to take more. Ap's 36 00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.780 sameeha siraj: and senior year. 37 00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:35.460 Jenny Duan: I think that sounds good. Yeah, I think because Ap's have more weight on your Gpa. I think you should try to prioritize those more, and then, with Ap's in your senior year, you should sign up with as many for as many as you think you can handle in the first semester, because in the second semester it doesn't actually matter if you take the test or not, because it'll be after you get accepted into your college. 38 00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:49.619 Jenny Duan: so it doesn't matter if you actually take the test at the end. But what matters is in that first semester, like how many Ap's can you successfully handle? So I think that's the goal to like. Try to sign up for as many as you can handle in semester one, and then semester 2. Honestly, it doesn't 39 00:05:49.660 --> 00:06:10.460 Jenny Duan: like. The honest answer is, it doesn't really matter what your grades are as long as you don't fail like, unless it's for yourself personally, like, I know people who've gotten into Stanford, and then second semesters in a year that got C's, and like, it's not like your college is going to rescind you. Unless you fail, don't fail a class. Then you know your admissions could get revoked. But if you get Bs in your second semester. No one's going to like. 40 00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:24.880 Jenny Duan: If you're a straight, a student, get B's. No one's gonna be like, oh, we're gonna kick you out of the school that you got accepted to so second semester senior year is really low pressure. It's mostly just, however, many you think you can handle in your first semester. Yeah, does that make sense? 41 00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:34.990 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And so I put down these specific goals from folklift. I'm just gonna copy paste. Goals from last time, because I feel like they're still pretty 42 00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.650 Jenny Duan: pretty similar. 43 00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.869 Jenny Duan: and do you have an update on the video game project? 44 00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:53.029 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah, so I started or like not started. But I implemented like dialogue into the into the classification scene. So kinda like 45 00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.029 sameeha siraj: it like makes sense in the game play now? And then I started 46 00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:14.339 sameeha siraj: working on like Was it the like? The exposition scenes where? It kind of like introduced like what the problem is, and kind of explains like what's going on. So like, I started writing the dialogue and the code for that as well. 47 00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:28.730 sameeha siraj: And like I made a spreadsheet for Ada Lovelace. And I'm working on one for car, for like I think I was, gonna add Carol Shaw, who made like the first atari, I think, so, yeah. 48 00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:37.380 Jenny Duan: okay, amazing. Sounds good. Okay. So I think we can pause here. Do you have any urgent questions before we move on to SAT. Things. 49 00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:52.889 sameeha siraj: So for for community college, do you think I should stick with just a courses that are articulate from my high school credits? Or do you think I should also take like the film class cause? I don't know if I should. 50 00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.540 sameeha siraj: They continue, both of them. 51 00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:02.549 Jenny Duan: Oh, I see what you mean. Do you plan on applying as a film, major at schools? Is that still your intention? 52 00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:20.349 sameeha siraj: Only like a few like, just for like, just for a chance, maybe apply to like Usc or Nyu for film. But I think, for, like Stanford and UC. Berkeley and such. I won't apply for like data science and AI ethics. 53 00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:35.010 Jenny Duan: Okay? Awesome. Then, yeah, I would still take the film class, because for Usc. And Nyu, if you want to apply for film, you need to have a portfolio. And so you should have like a couple of movies or things under your belt that you can show in your portfolio. 54 00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:43.920 Jenny Duan: Okay? Sounds good. So yeah, I would still stick with your phone class in addition to anything else that you would want to take. 55 00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.650 Jenny Duan: But yeah, keep your phone class. 56 00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.890 sameeha siraj: Okay, thank you. No problem. 57 00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:56.520 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then, yeah, I would be mindful of just thinking about your portfolio, and 58 00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.539 Jenny Duan: thinking about like what you would want to enter for that. And 59 00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:29.360 Jenny Duan: well, I think that's something that we can send some time on in a different session. But yeah, if you are like, seriously considering planning to apply as a film major to Usc and Nyu, which are like very competitive film schools. Then you should have like a pretty strong portfolio. That you'll need to prepare this year, and next summer. Cool. So for the sat wh what would be easiest for you? We can do just broad concept review, or we can go over questions that you've missed on previous tests. 60 00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.649 sameeha siraj: I think like kind of broad would kind of help me more, maybe. 61 00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.920 Jenny Duan: Ok, cool right off the top of your head. What section would you say that you struggled the most on? 62 00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.250 sameeha siraj: I think. I think there was the 63 00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.610 sameeha siraj: English section. I mean the writing one. 64 00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.260 sameeha siraj: Okay, like the grammar section. Yes. 65 00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:59.719 Jenny Duan: okay, we'll just do. Sat grammar review. with my God, okay. 66 00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.169 Jenny Duan: So I just wanna walk you through like some general tips. This is kind of 67 00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:17.850 Jenny Duan: like, I'm just gonna flood your brain with some information, and then we'll do some practice problems at the end. So just first of all for questions, asking which sentence or sentence fragment fits best 68 00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:25.100 Jenny Duan: almost all the time, like the shorter one or the shortest one is the correct answer. Then 69 00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:33.770 Jenny Duan: anything that has a comet plus in it. She day is a common spice, which is wrong. So, for example. 70 00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.829 Jenny Duan: say like, okay. 71 00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.219 Jenny Duan: comma. She went to the store 72 00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:53.859 Jenny Duan: a lot of the times. They'll have situations like this, and that's almost always wrong. Okay, I think these 73 00:10:54.070 --> 00:11:06.819 Jenny Duan: these you can just read over in your own time. You have, I think, I shared with this document, but I'll share in the chat again. But let me just go over some other things from the beginning. I think these general tips don't really come up that often. But 74 00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.060 Jenny Duan: okay, we'll go over part of the speech first. So 75 00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.189 Jenny Duan: have you had formal grammar classes yet? 76 00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.759 sameeha siraj: I don't think so. 77 00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:28.799 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you know what type of question you normally miss on the grammar section that'll help me know what to go. Let me see. Like II think there's like one 78 00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.979 sameeha siraj: Let me like open the test that I took, and then see 79 00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.790 Jenny Duan: awesome. 80 00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.120 sameeha siraj: Sometimes it's like 81 00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:09.320 sameeha siraj: through like questions. You're like nevertheless, alternatively finally. 82 00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.440 sameeha siraj: sometimes those type of questions or 84 00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:25.310 sameeha siraj: oh, I think, like the most hard ones for me, are like the ones where you're supposed to like. Place the sentence like, where it's most logical. 85 00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:39.570 Jenny Duan: Okay? Got it. So let's first talk about commas and separating clauses. So these are your transitions, like the additionally. Consequently, therefore, etc. So do you know what an independent, independent clause is 86 00:12:39.880 --> 00:13:00.549 Jenny Duan: okay. Awesome. Also. But tell me if you already know this stuff, because I'm just like going from the very, very basic. So most of the stuff you might already know. But I'm just gonna repeat it for redundancy. But just let me know if you like, already know this so there's 3 ways to separate 2 independent clauses, a period, a semicolon, and a comma plus a coordinated conjunction. 87 00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:11.289 Jenny Duan: so semicolon has the same usage as a period. So if you if you see a semicolon, it's basically like a period. So it separates 2 independent clauses. 88 00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.940 Jenny Duan: A comma 89 00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:25.349 Jenny Duan: is another way to connect different clauses. But if you have 2 independent clauses separated by a comma, that's a common spice, so you can't separate 2 independent clauses with a comma any time you see that happening that's just wrong. 90 00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.380 Jenny Duan: So 2 separate 2 commas can separate independent clause from an independent clause. 91 00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:40.380 Jenny Duan: However, they are not always separating a non essential clause, which means that an essential clause is basically the heart of a sentence. For example, if you say like 92 00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.980 Jenny Duan: therefore she went to the store. 93 00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.610 Jenny Duan: The part she went to the store would be the essential clause. 94 00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.840 Jenny Duan: And so here's the chart of when you should use a comma 95 00:13:51.540 --> 00:14:01.799 Jenny Duan: after name or title, always use a comma to separate a dependent clause from an independent clause, to separate a list, and after introductory words and phrases. 96 00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.660 Jenny Duan: so introductory words and phrases would be like first, second. 97 00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.130 Jenny Duan: etc., like that. 98 00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:15.550 Jenny Duan: And no you. So you shouldn't use a comma after the word that before, after the word, that after the word, and between 2 independent clauses. 99 00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.750 Jenny Duan: before, after prepositions between adjectives and nouns. 100 00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:33.079 Jenny Duan: and then all these other things I think, are, too, in depth. I don't think you need to like explicitly memorize the rest. Okay? And then dashes and parentheses. Do you know these types of questions? Are you familiar with these? 101 00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:42.209 Jenny Duan: like, if it's like, okay, do you typically get typically, get these questions right or wrong? 102 00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:53.309 sameeha siraj: Usually right. Cause. I think like these kind of questions. It's like the ending of the sentence would either have like a comma or like a dash, and I'll be able to tell like, which one to use. 103 00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.950 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. And then 104 00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.939 Jenny Duan: transitions. So there's 3 types of transitions, continuous contradictions and cause and effect. 105 00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:14.279 Jenny Duan: So sometimes with transitions, what they're testing you for is how it connects to the rest of the, you know, piece or passage. So you need to identify what type of transition you're working with, and then decide what works best. 106 00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:27.290 Jenny Duan: So, for example, there's like continuers that add information that gives an example, defy, clarify, emphasize, compared also contradictors. So these are your alternatively, conversely. 107 00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:38.850 Jenny Duan: etc., and cause and effect. So when you have 2 sentences together, sometimes you need to identify what type of transition. It is said, not only whether it's grammatically correct, but whether it fits the situation 108 00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:46.149 Jenny Duan: and then I think now that we've gone over this, let me run some practice problems. 109 00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.880 Jenny Duan: So 110 00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:54.419 Jenny Duan: you've done. Have you done all the Khan Academy tests like the SAT. Free practice test one through 10. 111 00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.430 sameeha siraj: No, I've been. I think I've been doing the ones on the college board site. 112 00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:06.339 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. I think those are the the same thing. So let me give you a test that you haven't done. 113 00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.979 Jenny Duan: and and how many of those have you done out of the tab? 114 00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.709 sameeha siraj: I think I've done like 6 of them. So let me. 115 00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.369 sameeha siraj: Yes, I did. 7, 8, 116 00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.429 sameeha siraj: the like. I think the fee that I didn't do were like 9, 117 00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.410 sameeha siraj: 5, one and 118 00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.620 sameeha siraj: 6, I think, yeah. 119 00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.210 Jenny Duan: okay, good. 120 00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.330 Jenny Duan: Let me find some other practice test. 121 00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.060 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna send you a link where? 122 00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.390 Jenny Duan: you can. 123 00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.090 Jenny Duan: You can find some more 124 00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.169 Jenny Duan: tests that you haven't taken yet. Give me a second. 125 00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:09.069 Jenny Duan: okay. 126 00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.579 Jenny Duan: can you see the chat 127 00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.500 sameeha siraj: slash my screen? Oh, yeah. 128 00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.540 Jenny Duan: Okay. So 129 00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.560 Jenny Duan: basically, here are 130 00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:36.379 Jenny Duan: It collected a database of some more sats that aren't released on the college board website. So, like April 2017, school day, may 2017, etc. And then here are the answers, 131 00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.520 Jenny Duan: yeah. 132 00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.380 sameeha siraj: okay, 133 00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:48.790 Jenny Duan: so let's just look at like the more recent one may 21 us. And 134 00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.760 Jenny Duan: okay, just gonna download this. 135 00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.820 Okay? 136 00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:03.529 Jenny Duan: So it's okay. If you go to that link, it's a safe link like you're not gonna download a virus. Click it, 137 00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.329 Jenny Duan: and just go to the mid 2020 21. Us test. 138 00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.909 sameeha siraj: Yeah. Okay, I'm on it now 139 00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:17.249 Jenny Duan: and then scroll down to the grammar section. So that starts on page 17 of the Pdf. 140 00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.080 sameeha siraj: okay. 141 00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.329 Jenny Duan: okay, so I think I just wanna go through these like starting from the top 142 00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:38.399 sameeha siraj: sort of one by one. And on the grammar section. How many typically do you get wrong out of the 44? I mean, like, usually I do pretty well like I think I think 143 00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:46.730 sameeha siraj: like 3 to 4. II think it's not that well, but like 3 to 4 wrong. But this time I think I got like, 8 wrong. So 144 00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.710 Jenny Duan: okay, have no problem. Have you reviewed what you've gotten wrong so far already? 145 00:18:51.800 --> 00:19:03.159 sameeha siraj: Yeah, they're like, mostly, I think, like like most of them, were the sentence, like where to put them. And then, like there were like 3 which were because of 146 00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.929 sameeha siraj: the transition words. 147 00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:14.950 Jenny Duan: okay. So let me just pick out those types of questions, and we'll look at them. So for number one, this is a transition. So what's the correct answer? 148 00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:25.769 sameeha siraj: her number one? 149 00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.130 sameeha siraj: it would be d 150 00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.410 Jenny Duan: yep. And why is that? 151 00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.510 sameeha siraj: Because, like, you don't really need the. This means 152 00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.759 sameeha siraj: cause it's not a new sentence, and in which it means 153 00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.339 sameeha siraj: doesn't really make sense. And then and meaning cause you're not explaining anything before. So meaning would be the correct answer. 154 00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.530 Jenny Duan: Awesome. That's really good. 155 00:19:52.730 --> 00:20:15.720 Jenny Duan: And I think that with every SAT question you should have an explicit answer in your head as to why, that's the correct answer. So there shouldn't ever be ambiguity. Does that make sense? So you should always be able to explain to yourself like, why is something correct, or why something wrong? So if you feel like you're guessing, then try to come up with an answer at least to yourself, like why something is correct or why the other answers are wrong. 156 00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:40.649 Jenny Duan: Because I think a lot of the times people approach the grammar section sort of based on vibes. They're like, okay, this one feels right. So I'm just gonna choose it. But I think you should have an explanation for yourself, like basically what you just said to me was perfect like, answer, A is wrong, because this answer, B is wrong, because this answer D is correct, because this you should always be able to justify your answers. And if you go off of vibes, I would say like, try to come up with an answer, if you can. 157 00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.850 sameeha siraj: Okay? 158 00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.679 Jenny Duan: And then. 159 00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:58.129 Jenny Duan: okay, let's look at question 10. Add delete. Revise. The writer wants to add the following sentence to this paragraph. where is the best placement for the sentence. 160 00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:04.149 Jenny Duan: and take your time with looking at this. Don't feel rushed. But once you're ready, let me know what the correct answer is. 161 00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.019 sameeha siraj: let's say after sentence, one. 162 00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's correct. Why. 163 00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:47.280 sameeha siraj: I think, cause it's kind of gives you like the foundation. So it says like they begin by, and then and the rest of us kind of expanding the rest of the project. 164 00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:57.219 sameeha siraj: or like the research and then the it won't be before the first one cause. That's kind of where they're introducing like what the research is. 165 00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.150 Jenny Duan: Got it? 166 00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:05.830 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And so what do you feel like is difficult about these types of questions, cause I feel like you got this one pretty immediately. 167 00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:26.539 sameeha siraj: I think not. It wouldn't be like necessarily, these type of questions. I think it'd be like like when it gives you like a sentence from the actual paragraph. And then it says like, where should it be moved cause. And then I think this one kind of makes more sense, because more like chronological. But sometimes in like. 168 00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.950 sameeha siraj: I'd say more 169 00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:39.099 sameeha siraj: fictional on text about that. That's when I kinda get confused cause they're kind of saying the same thing throughout, so you don't know like where to place it. 170 00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:40.610 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. 171 00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.400 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So what about this question? 11, this transition question. 172 00:22:48.030 --> 00:23:08.009 sameeha siraj: I'd probably say. 173 00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.319 sameeha siraj: okay, 174 00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.650 sameeha siraj: no change. 175 00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.970 Jenny Duan: I have. Why. 176 00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:46.599 sameeha siraj: I think. Okay. So it says, some plans propose moving threatened shallow water corals to deep waters. But this study suggests that. So it kind of like contradicts mid sentence 177 00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.990 sameeha siraj: like 178 00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:57.290 sameeha siraj: So the first sentence is kind of like the researchers hope that their findings can be used to improve quarrels. And then it kind of shows like 179 00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.989 sameeha siraj: how the plans 180 00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:14.860 sameeha siraj: I like that. And I kind of meanwhile, doesn't really make sense. Cause. It's not like happened. It's not like a time kind of thing, and as a result, would be kind of causes and effect. And conversely. 181 00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.849 sameeha siraj: I think that's kind of like 182 00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:27.650 sameeha siraj: it's like because of this, this happened, which is kind of the same as as a result. So I assume that like, for example, would be the best option. 183 00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:37.139 Jenny Duan: right? Because right here it says, the researchers hope that their findings can be used to improve coral conservation plans. And then, for example, 184 00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:44.149 Jenny Duan: right here. They're talking about the plans, and then they're illustrating a specific plan. So they're going more into detail about a specific plan that they talk about. 185 00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.640 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 186 00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:46.710 Jenny Duan: cool. 187 00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.140 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 188 00:24:51.240 --> 00:25:00.570 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think 13 is a good question to look at. At this point the writer wants to present argument that will be refuted. 189 00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.409 Jenny Duan: what do you think is the best answer. 190 00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.100 sameeha siraj: I say, C, 191 00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.139 Jenny Duan: correct. Yeah. Why? 192 00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:54.179 sameeha siraj: Because it says that it wants to be refuted in the next sent part of the sentence, and then I kind of read the beginning of the next part of the sentence, where it says, small businesses also stand to gain by going green. So I knew it had to be like despite, or although or while so, I kind of crossed out like the 193 00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.149 sameeha siraj: number, or like letter d and then 194 00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:08.499 sameeha siraj: I also saw that, like small businesses, large corporations, and also like kind of found, some one of the options which said that 195 00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:17.550 sameeha siraj: kind of like people think that small businesses wouldn't be able to gain. So yeah, I think C was the best option for that 196 00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.120 Jenny Duan: awesome 197 00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:34.819 Jenny Duan: awesome. That's correct. See the next one? okay. Hmm. 5, 15 is the transition one. 198 00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.199 Jenny Duan: What do you think is the correct answer. Oh, let's look at the end of the previous paragraph. 199 00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.540 Jenny Duan: Okay. 200 00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.539 Jenny Duan: alright. Now, let's look at this one. 201 00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.290 Jenny Duan: 15. 202 00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.720 sameeha siraj: Okay. 203 00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.160 sameeha siraj: can I see the end of the 204 00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.639 sameeha siraj: yeah, you can just look at it on your own. Pdf, as well. 205 00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.340 sameeha siraj: Okay. 206 00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.460 sameeha siraj: I'd say. 207 00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.010 sameeha siraj: d. 208 00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.350 Jenny Duan: yeah, that's correct. Why. 209 00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.560 sameeha siraj: this one is kind of like hard, which I don't have like a solid reasoning. 210 00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:07.709 sameeha siraj: But I'd say, like the other ones. The other options just kind of didn't make sense cause like the ending of the last paragraph kind of said 211 00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.649 sameeha siraj: like it would 212 00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:32.070 sameeha siraj: make employees wanna like apply. And that kind of like and see kind of con was like contradicting that by saying like, there's only 15 people and then the and letter B servicing motor homes as well as cars. It's kinda like off topic, and it doesn't really like relate to the last paragraph. 213 00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:38.660 sameeha siraj: and then the no change. I'd say like it just kinda introduces the shop rather than. 214 00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:39.920 sameeha siraj: and 215 00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:47.509 sameeha siraj: really likes adding anything. And then the DI think it doesn't, really. I won't say it's like that effective. But 216 00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:54.469 sameeha siraj: I feel like it's the most effective. So it was like one such business. A good transition. 217 00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:10.169 Jenny Duan: The reason why is exactly what you said in the previous paragraph, we talk about small businesses benefiting from renewable energy energy transitions on sort of a larger level right? And then we go into more specific about one such business. In this paragraph. 218 00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.730 Jenny Duan: So you're right. 219 00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.330 Jenny Duan: And now let's look. 220 00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:23.579 Jenny Duan: okay, let's look at 18. It's another transition. 221 00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.770 Jenny Duan: What's the correct answer here. 222 00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:37.130 sameeha siraj: I think it would be d 223 00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.440 Jenny Duan: correct. Why. 224 00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:52.180 sameeha siraj: I think, cause they already have the while so wouldn't be trans transcendentist, however or it doesn't really need another word, because it already says while. 225 00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.720 sameeha siraj: and then comma 226 00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.350 Jenny Duan: awesome. 227 00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.640 Jenny Duan: correct, and then 21. 228 00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:10.439 Jenny Duan: I think this one is a good one. It's which choice provides a second example, as most similar to the one in the previous sentence. So I think it'd be easy to just look at this on your own screen. But yeah, 21. 229 00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.840 sameeha siraj: Let's say, d 230 00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.480 Jenny Duan: correct. Yeah. Why. 231 00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:50.719 sameeha siraj: it kind of like it relates to the last sentence, where it's talking about like how it's attracting people because of going green and then d kind of says the same thing, but with like statistical evidence. 232 00:30:51.460 --> 00:31:06.069 Jenny Duan: Correct? Okay. Now, we're gonna move on to question 25. I think this is pretty good. which choice most effectively establishes the main topic of the paragraph. Are you pretty comfortable with this type of question? 233 00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.370 sameeha siraj: I'd say I'm kind of bad at these kind of questions, so 234 00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.979 Jenny Duan: perfect. Then we'll we'll just review it. 235 00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:18.100 sameeha siraj: Okay? So if we haven't gotten anything wrong, though. I'm surprised. 236 00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:57.769 sameeha siraj: would it be? 237 00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.120 sameeha siraj: D 238 00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.659 Jenny Duan: yeah, correct. A lot of these have been D, actually, why. 239 00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.309 sameeha siraj: okay, so I kinda I quickly read the paragraph. And I saw like 240 00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:24.810 sameeha siraj: the main theme was kinda him just like researching about the place. I couldn't really understand anything else except for, like him, researching about the place and its social issues and stuff. And I think all the other ones kinda 241 00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.310 sameeha siraj: topped about something else. 242 00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.919 sameeha siraj: And d was kind of like the one which is most on topic. 243 00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.120 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect. 244 00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:48.259 Jenny Duan: that sounds good, and I think another note I want to highlight. Is that with anything? You with anything on the SAT. You should not be feel 245 00:32:48.260 --> 00:33:13.230 Jenny Duan: like you're looking for a pattern in your answers like, I think this is something. When I was taking my sat I was like, Oh, like I got 3 C's in a row. The next one can't be a C or like I. You know I've got. I'm getting too many of the this one letter like, just don't worry about that. Just focus on whatever answers correct to you, because I've seen like real sats where they've had 4 of the same letter in the in a row. Or you know all these weird patterns like that. So 246 00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:21.979 Jenny Duan: just don't psych yourself out. If you know that something is correct. Just go with it, and don't look for answers in the scorecard, because that's just going to mess you up more. 247 00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.170 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 248 00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:39.349 sameeha siraj: cool. I feel like my main problem is like, when I'm actually taking the test. It feels like way worse, cause it's like timed and like you kind of try to rush through things, and you can't like calmly look at like each push, each like 249 00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:46.450 sameeha siraj: of the options. That's why, like a lot of these questions the ones with the longer answers, that's kind of where I mess up. 250 00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.249 Jenny Duan: Vasha. Do you run out of time when you take the SAT 251 00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:59.930 sameeha siraj: hmm! For some sections like I feel like I finish a right on the dot like for for this one writing 252 00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:08.150 sameeha siraj: I do get like. I think I have like 2 or 3 min remaining when I'm done and then for reading like I have, like 253 00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:17.340 sameeha siraj: 10 ish minutes left, and like I can review all my answers and stuff. But this one is, I think it's like the harder one cause it's like so short 254 00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:47.759 Jenny Duan: got it. I think this week I want you to do an extra like an extra. Just grammar section. Don't do a full extra test, but just do one extra grammar session, and instead of setting a timer, I want you set a stopwatch. So when you start, start a stopwatch and take as much time as you need. Just don't worry about the time. Focus on accuracy, and at the end see how much time you really need because after that you can work on like cutting down if you need to. But I want you to take a test and see how much time you actually need and work with no time. Pressure like, take 255 00:34:47.760 --> 00:35:02.140 Jenny Duan: unlimited amount of time, but try to get as many accurate as you can. Does that make sense? And then you do one of these. So instead of doing one of the real ones or the ones on the college board website, just do like any one of these, 256 00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Instead. 257 00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:10.559 Jenny Duan: Okay. I think I wanna look at 31. It's another longer. One. 258 00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.689 sameeha siraj: Yeah. Okay. 259 00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:27.040 sameeha siraj: Would it be? B. 260 00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.660 Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry. I was muted. Yes, why 261 00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:51.639 sameeha siraj: so I'd say, like I kinda read the first few sentences, cause I think in the beginning, where I kind of messed up. I read like the sentence before, but from the beginning it says, like 262 00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:55.409 sameeha siraj: in the case of his designs for the museum 263 00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:07.220 sameeha siraj: research showing was the shape of the building. And then I saw that the first one was kind of like I was gonna do other A or B but a kind of says 264 00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:27.379 sameeha siraj: like, how African American communities like wanted a a museum for a really long time, and then for their identity, which doesn't really like, relate to the main paragraph, and then see it doesn't like. It's not part of the main purpose of the paragraph. 265 00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.900 sameeha siraj: And then 266 00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:43.440 sameeha siraj: D, it's like also doesn't really like reinforce the sentence that I just read. And CI think it's or I think B is like the most strong one, because it talks about the shapes of the head wear 267 00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.410 sameeha siraj: but that like he describes in the sentence earlier. 268 00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.870 Jenny Duan: right? Exactly 269 00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:59.580 Jenny Duan: and then there's one more question I want to get to, which is 22. And I think this is the type that you struggle the most with. Right? 270 00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:01.480 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah. 271 00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.930 Jenny Duan: okay. So why don't we do this one? 272 00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.429 sameeha siraj: Okay? 273 00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:16.029 Jenny Duan: these are kind of hard because you get when you read it the first time you're like, Oh, you get used to putting that sentence exactly where it is right and then be able to change it. 274 00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.579 Jenny Duan: You might need to look at the previous paragraph, if you need to. 275 00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.890 sameeha siraj: Okay. 276 00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.759 Jenny Duan: to just get like context. 277 00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:24.790 sameeha siraj: let's say 278 00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.690 sameeha siraj: after sentence, 2, 279 00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.570 Jenny Duan: yeah, correct. Why. 280 00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:39.009 sameeha siraj: okay, this one. I kind of. I was kinda confused about this one. But I decided with after symptoms, too, because 281 00:39:39.380 --> 00:40:08.950 sameeha siraj: it kinda introduces like what she writes. So she's like. Once she describes her political exile, she writes, and then the rest, and then it doesn't really make sense right now, like where it is, because it. She kinda goes more into talking to like the or I guess these those sentences before like 3, and then 4 and 5, 3 and 4 and 6. It's kinda like after they introduce that she got exiled. 282 00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.610 sameeha siraj: so I think I think, after sentence 2 was like the most 283 00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:18.280 sameeha siraj: like cause sentence to also introduces, like what it is. So yeah. 284 00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.730 Jenny Duan: awesome. Sounds good. 285 00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.709 Jenny Duan: That's correct. Okay, I think 286 00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.199 Jenny Duan: you've actually got everything correct? 287 00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:37.450 Jenny Duan: so I feel like. I don't know. Do you feel like this? What do you feel like? You still feel the most confused about with this grammar section, or with grammar sections in general. 288 00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:45.730 sameeha siraj: Let me like, let me see if there's like any specific questions I had on the test. Okay. 289 00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:58.029 Jenny Duan: maybe it's just that matter of like overcoming the mental hurdle. I want you to take a test again this week and have no time pressure and see how you do cause. Maybe sometimes it is just that time pressure that affects you. 290 00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.510 sameeha siraj: yeah. 291 00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:25.469 Jenny Duan: because once we figure out, you know what the real issue is then we can solve it because sometimes you know. The real struggle for some students is that they just don't know the grammar concepts, or they just don't know how to do it. But for you I feel like, that's not the issue. I feel like your issue might be managing time management. And just like personal stress when taking the test. Yeah, I agree. 292 00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:35.919 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I was also like of the same opinion. But and I was not sure, because I was not looking at her evaluation, and how she was actually, how critical was she in kind of scoring herself? 293 00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:43.290 Ivy Mentors: So might be a good idea of that would be like if you could actually share, you know the questions that you got wrong, and what how do you think about that? 294 00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:55.580 Ivy Mentors: And how are you like in general, like, you know? How are you kind of scoring it that kind of stuff because you said you got 1,400 yesterday? Right? So yeah, I mean, might be. 295 00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.260 Ivy Mentors: So yeah. 296 00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:18.689 Ivy Mentors: I think I, identifying the root cause is something that I would actually focus on as well, because I don't know where is the gap then? Because I'm actually quite happy that she is being able to answer rightly. And then, as you said Jenny might be, it's the time, constraint, and might be. Then the focus is like, how how does she really manage time and stress? And that kind of stuff? So 297 00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.309 Jenny Duan: right? Totally, yeah. 298 00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:37.080 Jenny Duan: And don't worry like this is a very normal thing to go through like everyone when they take SAT. It's always a struggle like, obviously you're not the only person who is struggling with whatever it may be, whether that's time management, or something different, like, it's a very normal circumstance. 299 00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.719 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what were you gonna say, though? 300 00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:47.729 sameeha siraj: I think. Is that okay? If we kind of go over the no calculator section now. So I feel like 301 00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:59.459 sameeha siraj: while writing was kinda hard for me, but I feel like I think that was mainly because of time. But some questions on like the math section check me up. So yeah. 302 00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:16.640 Jenny Duan: I would say, let's do our other another session this week and do the math section. I think 2 min is probably not enough to go through it thoroughly. But yeah, cause they're running a little bit low on time. But I think let's get either. Let's do our Tuesday session. 303 00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:29.629 Ivy Mentors: As another sat section, or we can schedule another session because we still have one to make up, cause, I think a couple of weeks ago we skipped one. Hey, Jenny, if you guys want like more time, I'm fine. With that I can sacrifice my time. That's fine. So I'll I'll let you decide. 304 00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:35.160 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, like 15 h, 15 min, or half an hour more. That's fine, too. Like I mean, it's up to you. 305 00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.130 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 306 00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:49.670 Jenny Duan: Then let's say, let's just keep going, because I don't wanna lose the momentum that we're working on and so would it be helpful for you to share your screen, and we'll talk about the questions that you get wrong? Or do you want to go over concepts? 307 00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.230 sameeha siraj: I think I'll share my screen. 308 00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. 309 00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:01.580 sameeha siraj: Okay. Actually, I think this one was with calculator. But I got like a lot of questions wrong on this one. 310 00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.069 sameeha siraj: okay, how many wrong would you say? 311 00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.539 sameeha siraj: Thank you. 312 00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:14.249 sameeha siraj: This was, I had 2 wrong on the with calculator, and then I had 313 00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.220 sameeha siraj: 1, 2, 2, 4, 314 00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:22.939 sameeha siraj: like 5, 5 ish wrong on the with calculator. So 315 00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.970 Jenny Duan: okay, got it. So let's just start from the first one. 316 00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.110 sameeha siraj: Okay, 317 00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.039 sameeha siraj: should I go for the ones with calculator or 318 00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.609 Jenny Duan: yeah, let's just do the ones with calculators, since it seems like 319 00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:45.179 Jenny Duan: you've got you've got more of those wrong. And then for the no calculator section, do you feel like you're getting questions wrong because you make silly mistakes, or because you don't understand the concept. 320 00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:52.020 sameeha siraj: There's some questions that I don't understand the concept like thank 321 00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.050 sameeha siraj: let me try to find Ashley. 322 00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:04.019 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, it's if there's any. No calculator that you don't understand the concept. Maybe we can do those first as well. 323 00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.080 sameeha siraj: Yes, 324 00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:11.210 sameeha siraj: I'm not sure how I got this one wrong, but I think. 325 00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.110 sameeha siraj: it was number 6. I thought I didn't. Guys. But 326 00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:25.919 Jenny Duan: okay, what's up? Okay, how did you do this? First? Tell me how you did this question. Okay? So first, 327 00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:32.600 sameeha siraj: okay. So first, I think I did 2 x minus 3 YI turn it to like 328 00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:40.470 sameeha siraj: 2 x is equal to 3 y minus 14 and then I did. X is equal to 329 00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.570 sameeha siraj: and 330 00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:51.270 sameeha siraj: negative 7 plus 3 over 2 y. And then I substituted that value of x into the other equation. 331 00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.899 sameeha siraj: And then I got the value of y. 332 00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.819 sameeha siraj: and then I substituted that back into this equation to get the value of X 333 00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:06.169 sameeha siraj: and then I got x minus YI don't know what I answered. I think it did. 334 00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:12.209 sameeha siraj: and I answered a for some reason. 335 00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.939 Jenny Duan: Do you feel like you run out of time in the math sections. 336 00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:22.599 sameeha siraj: I think in the second, in the width calculator, when I ran out of time. 337 00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:35.409 Jenny Duan: Okay, no problem on the math section. The thing is, there's a lot of like hacks. To save time. So let me just share one of them with you right now. One of them is that you can completely 338 00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:38.730 Jenny Duan: subtract and add systems of equations. 339 00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:49.070 Jenny Duan: And usually when you do that, that saves a lot of time, and it also makes it more accurate. So whenever you see a question like this, where you're looking for a solution to the systems of equations. 340 00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.240 Jenny Duan: almost never are they asking you to substitute 341 00:46:52.330 --> 00:47:04.000 Jenny Duan: substitution is very easy to make mistakes with, and it takes a lot of time instead. Usually, what they're asking you to is directly manipulate the systems of equations. So in this case, 342 00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:09.240 Jenny Duan: so what would happen if you subtracted this equation from this equation? 343 00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:15.849 Jenny Duan: So take this whole equation and then subtract this equation. What do you get? 344 00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:20.370 sameeha siraj: you'd get 345 00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:25.070 sameeha siraj: negative x minus y. 346 00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.450 sameeha siraj: minus 347 00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.800 sameeha siraj: 8 348 00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.749 sameeha siraj: or equal to negative 8. 349 00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So you get I think 3 X minus 2 x is that should be positive. X, right? 350 00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:50.889 Jenny Duan: Oh, I guess you could substitute the top or the bottom. Yeah, it doesn't really matter if you subtract the bottom button from the top one, you would get yeah, negative x. 351 00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.449 Jenny Duan: negative, 3 x minus negative, 2 y is minus y 352 00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.839 Jenny Duan: is equal to 353 00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.630 sameeha siraj: negative. 8, right? 354 00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.969 Jenny Duan: But what if you want the eggs to be positive, then you do like 355 00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.020 Jenny Duan: 8 minus y 356 00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.300 Jenny Duan: equals? X, right? 357 00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.450 Jenny Duan: And then, okay, actually, this doesn't tell us that much. 358 00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:21.600 Jenny Duan: let's see how else we can manipulate these 2 equations. 359 00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:25.549 Jenny Duan: what if you subtracted the 360 00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:31.250 Jenny Duan: the first one from the second one. Then you get hacks. Oh, plus y. 361 00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.410 Jenny Duan: and then negative, 6 equals 8. 362 00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.840 Jenny Duan: But now you want to get what x minus y is. 363 00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.940 Jenny Duan: actually, never mind, I think you're still mighty to subdue a systems of equations. 364 00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:58.360 Jenny Duan: So okay, let's, I'm just gonna start over and see how I would approach this question. So the first thing that I would do is actually I would check if you could subtract the 2 equations in this case. I don't think that you can, however. 365 00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:05.349 Jenny Duan: But sometimes you are just able to like exactly add or subtract the equations, and it gives you the correct answer. 366 00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:19.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, if that doesn't work, then I would say, the next thing I would try to do is to either get them under like the same denominator, and solve 367 00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:27.819 Jenny Duan: or do systems of equations like you said. But I think systems of equations is generally the last thing that you should do, because it takes a long time. 368 00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:40.419 Jenny Duan: so I would still try to manipulate the equations when solving them. And what I'm going to do is I'm gonna multiply this by 3. And I'm gonna multiply the second equation by 2 to cancel out the X's 369 00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.950 Jenny Duan: does that make sense what I'm doing right now? 370 00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:44.930 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 371 00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.400 Jenny Duan: because I'm trying to get y. So 372 00:49:48.520 --> 00:50:00.830 Jenny Duan: once I do that, I get 6 x minus 9 y equals negative. Think for 2, and then 6 x minus foury is equal to negative 12. 373 00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:02.209 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? 374 00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.420 sameeha siraj: Yes. 375 00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:11.620 Jenny Duan: Okay. And then I'm going to subtract the second equation from the first. So negative 9 y minus negative 4 y is what? 376 00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.770 sameeha siraj: Oh, sorry. What? 377 00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.970 Jenny Duan: So if I subtract the second equation from the first equation, what do I get? 378 00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:19.850 No 379 00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:29.079 sameeha siraj: You get negative 13 y. or is that? 380 00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:36.760 sameeha siraj: Oh, you'd get negative. 5 y is equal to 381 00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:42.129 sameeha siraj: 30, 30 negative 30. 382 00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.800 Jenny Duan: Right? Exactly. So y is equal to what? 383 00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:52.209 sameeha siraj: 30. And oh, not my bad. Y's equal to negative. 6, 384 00:50:52.400 --> 00:51:01.630 sameeha siraj: 6, 6. Okay, no problem. And then, after you do this, it should be pretty easy to solve for X, so you can get twox minus what? 385 00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.660 Jenny Duan: 3 minus 3 times y. 386 00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.750 sameeha siraj: oh, yeah, that would be 18 387 00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.789 Jenny Duan: equals negative 14. So 2 x is equal to what? 388 00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:18.990 sameeha siraj: it would be. 389 00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.149 sameeha siraj: Okay. I'm just like it's not loading on my screens. 390 00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.540 Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry. 391 00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.010 sameeha siraj: Okay, it would be 392 00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:33.890 sameeha siraj: 2 x is equal to 4, and then x is equal to 2. 393 00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:38.260 Jenny Duan: So what is x minus y. 394 00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:44.219 sameeha siraj: negative 4. 395 00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:48.490 Jenny Duan: Exactly perfect. So I don't know. 396 00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:54.979 Jenny Duan: yeah, when you went to when you did it with systems of equations. Where do you think you made the mistake? 397 00:51:55.990 --> 00:52:17.819 sameeha siraj: I think like substituting is kind of like a long process. And I might have like, probably when I got the answer of like what y is equal to. I probably substituted into like the wrong equation, or like the wrong. Yeah, the wrong equation, like, for example, I probably like substituted it into like a 398 00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:26.629 sameeha siraj: like when y is equal to this value, I probably substituted the x in for like the wrong thing. So yeah. 399 00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:43.919 Jenny Duan: awesome. Yeah, I think doing this where you're manipulating the systems of equations directly, and you're trying to like, get rid of some of the variables is a lot faster. Then, if you just try to solve for each of the variables directly with fractions like, try to avoid fractions in all cases. 400 00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:57.939 Jenny Duan: And this is the strategy that you can use like either, subtracting the equations directly, and if you're not able to do that, then like, try to get them under a common constant, and then, like subtracting either the X values or the Y values. Should be easier. 401 00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:11.409 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? That's the strategy that you can kind of have in the back of your head. But did you want to go to the next question? Now, is there another? No calculator question that you didn't understand? Or should we go straight to the calculator section? 402 00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:17.260 sameeha siraj: Let me just see if Number 10 like, why he got it wrong and check. 403 00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.279 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah, I think this one? II don't really know how to do it. 404 00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.139 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 405 00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:27.889 Jenny Duan: Okay. So what does it mean for a system of equations to have no solution. 406 00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:35.120 sameeha siraj: For them not to like equal each other, maybe or 407 00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.870 sameeha siraj: I'm not sure. 408 00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.839 Jenny Duan: Yes. So for 2 lines. What does it mean for them to 409 00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:48.560 Jenny Duan: have no solution, cause assistance of equations. It's just equations for 2 lines, right? 410 00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:52.309 sameeha siraj: I guess. For them not to have like a point of intersection. 411 00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.659 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and what does that look like? 412 00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:57.259 sameeha siraj: Do you have an Internet airline? 413 00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:58.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah, they're parallel. 414 00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.349 Jenny Duan: And so in this case, what it would, it mean for this equation to have no solution. 415 00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:11.710 sameeha siraj: I think, the value of K would have to 416 00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:16.889 sameeha siraj: be the same as a value of like the slope. Maybe. 417 00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So when the 418 00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:31.640 Jenny Duan: yeah. So you want the x's to be the same. But you want the. So you want the equations to be the same, but equal different constants. Does that make sense? 419 00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:33.230 sameeha siraj: Okay, yeah. 420 00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:39.720 Jenny Duan: So we're gonna do what we did in the last in the last problem. And we're going to 421 00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:52.989 Jenny Duan: get them under. We're gonna get the Y values to be the same. And if the Y values are the same, then we can make the X values the same that way that they're they're the same equation. But equally different constants. 422 00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000 Jenny Duan: Does that process make sense? Or is that in and of itself confusing? 423 00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:02.280 sameeha siraj: Oh, so you're gonna like, multiply 4 by a number to make it 7. 424 00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:12.820 Jenny Duan: Not quite. Because we're looking for K, so we're trying to get K to be equal to whatever this 4 is equal to in the end. 425 00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:25.099 Jenny Duan: So let me just walk you through it. And then maybe that'll be helpful. So we're gonna multiply this equation by 3. And this equation by 5, because we want to get the Y values the same. Does that make sense? 426 00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.899 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 427 00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:30.629 Jenny Duan: So what would happen to the first equation if we multiplied by 5, 428 00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:43.229 sameeha siraj: leave 5 KX minus 15 y is equal to 20. Yeah, perfect. And then what about a second? When you multiply by 3 12 x minus 15 y is equal to 429 00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.390 sameeha siraj: 21. 430 00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:51.520 Jenny Duan: So now that the y's are the same, we just want to make sure that the X's are the same. So we want 5 k. To equal 12. Does that make sense? 431 00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:52.630 sameeha siraj: Yes. 432 00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:54.719 Jenny Duan: So what's K? 433 00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.890 sameeha siraj: It would be 434 00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.620 sameeha siraj: 12 over 5 435 00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:17.389 Jenny Duan: perfect, because we, what we wanted is we wanted the same equation, but equaling different constants. Because, if we remember, if we draw on, you know a coordinate axis, then the constants are the parts where it intersects with the y-axis, right? 436 00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.480 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 437 00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:22.870 Jenny Duan: So if we if we have the same line, but 438 00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:27.159 Jenny Duan: I cannot draw a straight line. We have the same 439 00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:37.849 Jenny Duan: if we have the same coordinate plane. But let's just say that the lines intersect on different parts of the axis, then you know that they're going to be parallel, right? 440 00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:45.330 sameeha siraj: and that means that they have no solution. Does that make sense or is that confusing yeah, that makes sense no. 441 00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:52.649 Jenny Duan: cool okay, i'm gonna give you an example problem. Let's wait. Stay on this question. 442 00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.730 Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna write you another problem. And I want you to solve it. 443 00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:59.030 sameeha siraj: Is that? Okay? Yeah. 444 00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:11.910 Jenny Duan: okay, so let's say, 5 x minus 20. Y is equal to 7 is equal to 3, and then 445 00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:24.070 Jenny Duan: 3 x plus KY is equal to 4. For what value of k, will the system of equations have no solution? 446 00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:25.510 Jenny Duan: We solve this? 447 00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:34.830 sameeha siraj: I can't see the equation on my okay, I don't see it. Okay. 448 00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:43.880 Jenny Duan: and feel free to. Yeah. 449 00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:55.889 Jenny Duan: I said, feel free to just like, write on the screen right on paper. Through it. Whatever you feel most comfortable with, you can do it on paper, too, if you need to. I think I'll do on screen. So then 450 00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.370 sameeha siraj: and 452 00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:15.960 Jenny Duan: not quite 453 00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.370 Jenny Duan: they're really close. 454 00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.590 sameeha siraj: I think, i'm doing like this step wrong over here. 455 00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:33.189 Jenny Duan: Yup, so you don't need to worry about what the constants are the constants like at the end 9 and 20, you can forget you're just trying to solve for K. And how are you going to do that? 456 00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.340 sameeha siraj: So we subtract this bottom one? 457 00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.600 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to do any subtraction. Is there another way? You can do it. 458 00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:49.740 sameeha siraj: Oh, with 459 00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:51.740 sameeha siraj: we'd set them equal. 460 00:59:52.440 --> 01:00:07.100 sameeha siraj: Yeah, exactly. Forget about that. But you don't need to look at the 20 and the 9. Those are irrelevant. Now at this point, so negative 60 y would equal to 5. Ky, okay, yeah. Perfect. And then k is equal to 12 461 01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:10.030 Jenny Duan: and is cable the 12. 462 01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.659 sameeha siraj: Oh, negative. 12. 463 01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:16.780 Jenny Duan: Perfect. Yeah, okay, does that make sense on how you just solve that question? 464 01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.220 sameeha siraj: Yeah, I think I think I got tripped up over here like 465 01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.050 sameeha siraj: I didn't know they could equal each other. So yeah. 466 01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:40.030 Jenny Duan: awesome. Yeah. Because when you're looking for having no solution, then, like whatever, it equals whatever's on the right side of the equation doesn't matter, because all you want to do is have the left side be the same, and then the right side, you want them to be different, because those are the different 467 01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:51.640 Jenny Duan: because on the line, if you imagine it on a coordinate plane, the 2 lines have to intersect have to intersect the Y axis at 2 different points. So that's why you don't want to set the things on the right side to be the same thing as well. 468 01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:57.860 Jenny Duan: because if they were the same thing the lines would be parallel. I mean, the lines would be the same line, and they would have infinite solutions. 469 01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.030 sameeha siraj: Okay. okay, okay. 470 01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:08.770 Jenny Duan: Now, let's do the calculator section. Are there like a couple of specific questions that you feel like were the most challenging. 471 01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:11.570 sameeha siraj: Okay? Yeah. 472 01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.179 sameeha siraj: I think there was one of the 473 01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:25.159 sameeha siraj: only there was one question on like the the bubble end, one which I just like didn't get at all. 474 01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.309 sameeha siraj: We find it. 475 01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:39.429 sameeha siraj: I think it's always a system of equations and of inequalities with this one. I didn't really understand how to do it. 476 01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:50.770 Jenny Duan: Ok, let's go over it in the XY plane. If I point with coordinates, A B lies in the solution set of the system of equations above, what is the maximum possible value of? B, 477 01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:52.180 Jenny Duan: okay. 478 01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:58.350 Jenny Duan: so let's just graph this and see what? Oh, I think. 479 01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:09.389 sameeha siraj: Okay, are you familiar with graphing on your graphing calculator? What? That's a good calculator. Do you know how to graph on it? 480 01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.840 sameeha siraj: No. 481 01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:29.719 Jenny Duan: okay, that's your mission for this week. I want you to look up on Youtube, a graphing tutorial, how to graph equations, how to graph in qualities, how to graph circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas on your calculator. I'm gonna write that down in your document just so you can remember 482 01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.910 Jenny Duan: how to grab 483 01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:38.940 Jenny Duan: and 484 01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:46.639 Jenny Duan: systems of equations, inequalities, circles, ellipses, hyperbolas. 485 01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:54.589 Jenny Duan: and that should be it because your calculator will be very helpful in helping you find solutions in other things. 486 01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:07.719 Jenny Duan: So in the Xy plane point with coordinates ab licens in the solution set of the systems of A Co system of inequalities above, what is the maximum possible value of B. So let's just like we can graph this on paper kind of 487 01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.980 Jenny Duan: to see what it looks like. So 488 01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.289 Jenny Duan: you know that this, let's just say, this is like 3,000. 489 01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:23.020 Jenny Duan: it has a negative slope. Right? So what does that line look like? Kinda like something like that? Right? 490 01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:24.510 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 491 01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:31.800 Jenny Duan: And then y is greater than or equal to 5 x. Where is the Where does intersect the y axes? 492 01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:38.870 sameeha siraj: at 3,000? 493 01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:42.900 sameeha siraj: No, for the second equation. Oh, 494 01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.420 sameeha siraj: at the 0. 495 01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.779 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect. So this is, gonna look something like 496 01:03:53.030 --> 01:04:03.989 Jenny Duan: this, the slope is not as steep as the first one, but just like, excuse my bad drawing skills. So it's gonna yeah, it's gonna look something like like, Oh, my, gosh, that's 497 01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:16.789 Jenny Duan: if this were actually just pretend like, this is at the origin. Okay, you get the idea. So where? What are you trying to find? You're trying to find the maximum possible value of B, 498 01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.490 Jenny Duan: so let's see. 499 01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:22.860 Jenny Duan: negative 15 x plus 2,000 500 01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.580 Jenny Duan: in the solution set. So less than 501 01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:34.929 Jenny Duan: So you're looking for stuff that's less than this, right? So I'm just gonna shade in here. It's less than the first equation, right? Does that make sense? 502 01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.610 sameeha siraj: Yeah? 503 01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:42.070 Jenny Duan: And then the second equation, you're looking for less than this. So it's gonna be this area right? 504 01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:49.389 Jenny Duan: And just looking at this graph, what is the maximum value of B like? Where is it on the graph? Can you point to it. 505 01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.979 sameeha siraj: Would it be over here? 506 01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:56.259 Jenny Duan: Yes, and this is also the point of intersection. Right? 507 01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.760 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 508 01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:22.809 Jenny Duan: So all you have to do is if you were to solve this with equations, you can just say, like, where does negative 15 x plus 3,000 equal 5 x. That's another way to solve that. Or once you've graphed these 2 in your graphing calculator, there's actually a feature to just find, like the point of intersection like you should just be a button where you can just press, find point of intersection. And that's something that you should look into this weekend while you're researching how to use your graphing calculator. 509 01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:31.359 Jenny Duan: So I mean, either way is is fine, like solving. This is not to not to time intensive. You just see 20 x is equal to 3,000. 510 01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:38.749 Jenny Duan: So you do. X is equal to, and then you can use your calculator to do 3,000 divided by 20 which should be 511 01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:45.639 Jenny Duan: I think something like 1,500, but 512 01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:50.299 Jenny Duan: I mean 1 50 and negative 1 50. Sorry. 513 01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.690 Jenny Duan: actually wait. No. 514 01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.159 Jenny Duan: pause. Her 1 50, I think that's the answer. But you can verify this. 515 01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:01.310 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 516 01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:06.330 Jenny Duan: So that would be, how you solve this type of question, does that make sense? 517 01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:07.440 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 518 01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:12.290 Jenny Duan: okay, are there any questions that you have? Like burning questions about? 519 01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:30.559 sameeha siraj: yeah, this one is kind of like confusing. No. 2025. 520 01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:38.579 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Geometry. Okay. what is closest to the volume of the grain silo. So just looking at this question, how did you try to approach it? 521 01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:47.590 sameeha siraj: So first, like, I kinda went back to like where it gives you the formulas over 522 01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:51.450 sameeha siraj: in the beginning. I'm gonna use this one hmm 523 01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:58.609 sameeha siraj: to find like the cylinder. And then, like the cone and this one 524 01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:00.460 sameeha siraj: so 525 01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:07.550 sameeha siraj: wait. I don't know. Wait! I'm confused, cause I feel like I don't remember doing this question. I don't 526 01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.729 sameeha siraj: think it looks confusing, but I don't 527 01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:12.020 sameeha siraj: remember. 528 01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:15.740 sameeha siraj: I don't think this is the right test, actually. 529 01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:21.899 sameeha siraj: Oh. wait. isn't it? 530 01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.649 sameeha siraj: Oh, my God! It was it was another one. 531 01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:34.369 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's look at the other test. 532 01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:53.660 sameeha siraj: Then what about that? Systems of equations? Question, how did you remember that one? I looked at my answer she and I think that's the one that I think that's the the I think the other section. I don't know. I remember doing those, but I don't know why II don't remember any of those any of those questions. 533 01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.139 sameeha siraj: yeah. 534 01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.710 sameeha siraj: 20 535 01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.410 sameeha siraj: 7, I think. Wait. 536 01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:04.170 Jenny Duan: So which test did you do? If it wasn't this one? 537 01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:16.160 Jenny Duan: It was it was this one, the wait. Am I sharing it right now? I think it's under the practice of 3 steam. I have to unshare and then reshare. Okay, this is 538 01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.780 sameeha siraj: okay. 539 01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.460 Jenny Duan: so 27, you said. 540 01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:27.740 Jenny Duan: Okay, oh, these are pretty common question types. Okay, it's good that we do this. So 541 01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:32.249 Jenny Duan: okay, the world's population has grown an average rate of 1.9%. 542 01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:47.330 Jenny Duan: There were approximately 4 billion people in 1,975. And then what are the functions? Represents? Which of the functions represents the world's population? P. And billions to years since 1975. 543 01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.290 Jenny Duan: How did you approach this question? 544 01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:55.329 sameeha siraj: So I knew that. Like, since it's like a 19% 545 01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:59.870 sameeha siraj: increase. It wouldn't be like 1.9 or 1.1 9, or like 546 01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:12.450 sameeha siraj: a 1.9% increase, so it wouldn't be 1.9 or 1.19. So it had to be a or DI think II said, D, but I think 547 01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:25.749 sameeha siraj: now that I think on it. It doesn't really make sense. Cause do you use kinda like it initially starts. And this is how much it goes per year. But I don't. That's not accurate, cause it's like percent of 4 billion. 548 01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:35.140 sameeha siraj: So I see where this stuff but like, if there's like more questions like this, I kinda wanna know how to do them. 549 01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:43.160 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so population rate, all of these, they're gonna be exponent questions. And with exponent questions, because 550 01:09:43.160 --> 01:10:06.309 Jenny Duan: everything every year you're building off of what you had the previous year. Right? So when they say 1.9 per year since 1945, they're not adding a fixed number of people every year. So the answer is not going to be a linear equation, because it's not like every year, you know, like 20 babies are born or whatever it's, you know, a certain percentage of what was last year. So it's gonna be continuously increasing. And if you think about what the 2 graphs look like 551 01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.110 Jenny Duan: the graph is gonna look more like that. 552 01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:22.080 Jenny Duan: Cause. If every year you know a certain number of things increase, then you know, compounds year every year versus just a linear increase like this. This is the same concept. Have you heard about the book? Atomic habits? 553 01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:24.320 sameeha siraj: Yeah, I've heard of it. 554 01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:29.049 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So you know how atomic and atomic habits they see like a 1% increase 555 01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:41.660 Jenny Duan: leads to like a huge amount of improvement over time, right? And that's of like compound interest. And the same thing here, because it's compounded. And it's not like a fixed increase every year. So that's why you need to do 556 01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:47.920 Jenny Duan: this exponent. And you're right in eliminating. Be like, that's definitely wrong. C is definitely wrong. 557 01:10:48.290 --> 01:11:03.840 Jenny Duan: and the constant is usually whatever you start with, because if you think about when t is 0, when t is 0, when an exponent is 0, then that's one right. For example, like any constant A to the 0 is just one. Does that make sense? Yeah? 558 01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:09.549 Jenny Duan: So at the start, in 1975, the population is 4 billion right? 559 01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:23.499 Jenny Duan: And so every single year after that you're multiplying it by 1.0 1 9. So you're adding 19 of what they had the previous year? To the following year. Does that make sense? Yeah. 560 01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:29.440 Jenny Duan: so does this type of question make sense to you? Or are there any other aspects of it that are confusing. 561 01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.810 sameeha siraj: I think this kind of makes sense to me now 562 01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:49.379 sameeha siraj: cool. I just realized the last practices. I think that's probably because that was one of the ones that I was taking like throughout the week, just to different sections. And I didn't get to mess Nope with calculator yet. But I think 563 01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:57.710 sameeha siraj: I'll try to find the one which it was like, it was also a volume, question, but I didn't understand it. And then 564 01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.090 sameeha siraj: also. 565 01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:04.869 sameeha siraj: I think the 30 sixth one on this one is not so confusing for me this one 566 01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:15.420 Jenny Duan: alright cool. 36. Let's go for that in the figure above. Tan B, so are you familiar with trigonometry like sign Cosign tangent. 567 01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.350 Jenny Duan: Okay? So what does tangent stand for? 568 01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:22.810 sameeha siraj: opposite, over adjacent. 569 01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:32.520 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I think it's adjacent. But I think pronunciation obviously doesn't really matter. It's math. 10 B equals 3 over 4. So what's the opposite 570 01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.169 sameeha siraj: opposite of tan. 571 01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:41.830 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, like what would be the opposite for B, so like what side would be like? 3. 572 01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.269 sameeha siraj: Oh, it would be DE, 573 01:12:45.990 --> 01:13:01.590 Jenny Duan: yeah, so 3. And adjacent is this one? Right? So 3, 4. So this type of triangle is called a 3, 4, 5 triangle and this is just a ratio that you would need to know and memorize, so be in this case would be 5. 574 01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.190 Jenny Duan: Are you familiar with the different, like common types of triangles. 575 01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:16.410 sameeha siraj: I know about the at the 30 60, 91, and then I know there's like the 90 45 and 45. But I've never heard of. Like the 3, 4, 5, one. 576 01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:24.970 Jenny Duan: Okay, just commit this one to memory. It's another type of right triangle. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 9, 1215. All the same thing. 577 01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:35.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. BC, equals 15. And okay. So if you know that BC equals 15 and D 578 01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.809 Jenny Duan: a equals 4. 579 01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.449 Jenny Duan: Then what is the length of DE. 580 01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.730 Jenny Duan: So another thing the engines know is 581 01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.719 Jenny Duan: BDE is similar to BAC. 582 01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:57.020 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense. Why, okay? So the ratios of the lanes are going to be the same. 583 01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:59.240 Jenny Duan: Okay. 584 01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.050 Jenny Duan: okay. PI see. So if you know that be 585 01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:18.050 Jenny Duan: BC is 15, and DA is 4, because these ratios are like a 3, 4, 5 like this triangle BAC also has a 3, 4, 5 ratio. 586 01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:20.340 Jenny Duan: in its silence. Does that make sense? Why? 587 01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:21.580 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 588 01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:27.790 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Because tan of B also corresponds to the ratio. 589 01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:36.840 Jenny Duan: between Ca, and BA. In this case, tan B, 3 or 4 could also mean that. Ca is 3, and BA is 4. Does that make sense? 590 01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.090 sameeha siraj: So they'd be equal. 591 01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:44.240 sameeha siraj: No, they're not equal. The ratios are equal. 592 01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:58.409 Jenny Duan: So it's not like DE and H and Ca are equal, but it's more like the ratios between them are equal. For example, if this were a 3, 4, 5 triangle, if BED. Were like a 3, 4, 5 triangle. Then BCA, could be a. 593 01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:04.839 Jenny Duan: let's say, 6, 8, 10, triangle where the ratios between the sides are the same. Does that make sense? Yes. 594 01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:13.600 Jenny Duan: okay. And so that's all we need to notice, because these are 2 right triangles, 2 similar right triangles. And how do we know that they're similar? 595 01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:17.360 sameeha siraj: Because they have their same angles 596 01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:26.960 Jenny Duan: exactly exactly perfect. So the BC is 15, and you know that this is a 3, 4, 5 triangle. Then what is the length of BA, 597 01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.240 sameeha siraj: it will be 8 598 01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.079 Jenny Duan: exactly. Wait, actually. 599 01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.570 Jenny Duan: can you explain why it's 8? 600 01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.250 sameeha siraj: Bd is 4, and DA is 4, so I kind of combine them. I saw a skate. 601 01:15:45.640 --> 01:16:07.689 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, no, BD is not actually 4 this. This 3, 4, 5 doesn't refer to the actual sidelines. It refers to the ratio between the sidelines. So right now we still don't know what BD is. Just you can ignore this we don't know. We only know this as the ratio. We don't know what the actual length of BD is, but now we need to know what BA is given that you know. BA. 602 01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:16.489 Jenny Duan: It has a ratio of 4, and BC. Has a ratio of 5, so like the ratio between these 2 sides is 5 is 4 to 5. So 603 01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.299 Jenny Duan: x to 15 is also 4 to 5. 604 01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.509 sameeha siraj: Does that make sense? Yeah. 605 01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:23.500 Jenny Duan: And so what's x? 606 01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:28.450 sameeha siraj: So that would be 12, 607 01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:34.179 Jenny Duan: yeah. 12. So what's now? What's the length? If BA is 12, what's the length of BD 608 01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:38.370 sameeha siraj: It would be 8. 609 01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:46.590 Jenny Duan: Exactly. So. BD is 8, and now we know that you know be 610 01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:52.360 Jenny Duan: Now we know that, you know Tan B is 3 to 4 right 611 01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:54.569 Jenny Duan: again. We're bringing it back to this. 612 01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.550 Jenny Duan: you know that. So we know that 613 01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.900 Jenny Duan: 3, 2 DE, so I'm just gonna call 614 01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:08.660 Jenny Duan: GEX is the same thing as 4 to 8. Does that make sense? 615 01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:22.040 Jenny Duan: b is opposite right DE is what we have here has the ratio of 3, and then BD has the ratio of 8. But it's also like the the 4 side in terms of the ratios. 616 01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.250 sameeha siraj: Okay, yeah. 617 01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:25.209 Jenny Duan: So what's X? 618 01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:28.840 sameeha siraj: it will be. 619 01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.210 sameeha siraj: Wait. Does X represent A to C or a C 620 01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:39.589 Jenny Duan: X represents DE, sorry. 621 01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.730 sameeha siraj: Okay, 622 01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:50.559 sameeha siraj: Oh, I'm kind of confused like, what does that 3 stand for? Then? Like, yeah, 3. Is this ratio? 623 01:17:50.760 --> 01:18:14.540 Jenny Duan: because de and Bd have a 3 to 4 ratio. So 3 to 3 is the length of X, and since we already solve the length of BD. Right, we know that this side, with the 4 ratio has a length of 8, and we know that since it's a 3, 4, 5 triangle, if we know the ratios, we can use the ratios to get the side length, so if they're side with ratio, 4 has the length of 8, then decided 624 01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:16.939 Jenny Duan: with ratio 3 has a length of what? 625 01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:22.800 sameeha siraj: Oh, 6. 626 01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:25.700 Jenny Duan: Exactly. So. The length of DE is 6. 627 01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:37.119 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? Okay, actually, that might be a bit confusing. Now, I want you to find. So now that we've I've walked you through how to find the length of de based on what we know. What's the length of A/C 628 01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.140 sameeha siraj: it would be 629 01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:47.759 sameeha siraj: 3. Oh, not 3. Sorry. It has a ratio of 3. But what's the length? 630 01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:52.019 sameeha siraj: it'll be 12. 631 01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.070 Jenny Duan: We know that BA has leave. 12, right? 632 01:18:57.670 --> 01:18:58.609 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah. 633 01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:10.550 sameeha siraj: Oh, okay. So it would be. 634 01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:11.970 sameeha siraj: And 635 01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.040 sameeha siraj: 18. 636 01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:17.060 Jenny Duan: Why? 637 01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.570 sameeha siraj: Because if 638 01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:29.690 sameeha siraj: wait, so de is 6 then 6 to 6 times 3 is 18. 639 01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:38.060 sameeha siraj: wait, why are you multiplying it by 3? Okay. 640 01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:40.260 sameeha siraj: I'm kind of confused cause. There's like. 641 01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.600 sameeha siraj: like a lot of ratios, cause for no, there's like 4 to 5, and then there's like 4 to 8. 642 01:19:46.840 --> 01:20:07.350 sameeha siraj: And then, okay, let's just ignore. Let's ignore the little triangle. So if you know that these this is a 3, 4, 5, triangle right? Which means that in the in terms of ratios. Ca, it has ratio. 3 BA has ratio 4, and BC has ratio 5. Does that make sense? 643 01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:09.800 Jenny Duan: 9. Right? Perfect? 644 01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:19.090 Jenny Duan: Okay, I really wanna make sure that you get this concept down. So now I'm gonna clear the whole screen. And I want you to explain how to solve for the length of 645 01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:24.909 Jenny Duan: BE. And I want you to walk me through that process. How do we solve for BE, 646 01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:30.010 sameeha siraj: which is this? Link VE, okay. 647 01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:36.009 sameeha siraj: so 10 B is equal to 3 over 4. So 648 01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:40.949 sameeha siraj: 3, and work and then 649 01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.959 sameeha siraj: BC, we know is 650 01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:48.920 sameeha siraj: like entirely 15 651 01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:53.309 sameeha siraj: and then DA is 4, 652 01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:07.640 sameeha siraj: so do the do that 3, 4, 5 ratio. We know that this is going to be like the ratio of 5 653 01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.910 sameeha siraj: perfect. And so now 654 01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.090 sameeha siraj: we should to find like this total thing. 655 01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:20.460 sameeha siraj: it would be a. 656 01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:25.110 sameeha siraj: So, this would be 3, 4 and the left that's a 5, 657 01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:30.120 sameeha siraj: so i guess 3, times 5 is 658 01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:38.910 sameeha siraj: 13. So like 3 would be your think they were multiplying this ratio by so 659 01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:42.119 sameeha siraj: 3 times 4 is 12. 660 01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:46.510 sameeha siraj: And so that's our length of 661 01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:54.790 sameeha siraj: Oh, oops. Okay. So 3 times. What is 15? And it's 5, 662 01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.130 Jenny Duan: right? 663 01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.990 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 664 01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:03.149 Jenny Duan: And then what's what's after that? 665 01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:05.470 sameeha siraj: Oh, okay, to find the other ones. 666 01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:07.240 Jenny Duan: You're looking for the 667 01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:10.279 Jenny Duan: the length of be 668 01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.230 sameeha siraj: right? And so, yeah. 669 01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:15.429 Jenny Duan: so how did you get 5 as the answer there? 670 01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.570 sameeha siraj: Because the ratio 671 01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:30.939 sameeha siraj: since, like we know that this triangle is a 3, 4, 5, and then we know that this, like entire side, this entire side is 15, 672 01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:32.620 sameeha siraj: so I'll be like 673 01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:36.749 sameeha siraj: 15 to 5, 674 01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:44.500 sameeha siraj: x to 4, 675 01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.050 sameeha siraj: and then 676 01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:53.220 sameeha siraj: I'm gonna call this like y 2, 3. 677 01:22:53.550 --> 01:23:00.760 Jenny Duan: But you're talking. Then you're talking about the big triangle you're talking about? BAC, but I'm asking you about the length of BE, the little one. 678 01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 679 01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:09.579 sameeha siraj: Yeah, so like. So 5 like, we don't know 5, right? But we know that this is like the 5 of the 680 01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.340 sameeha siraj: 3, 4, 5 681 01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.520 sameeha siraj: ratio. 682 01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.110 sameeha siraj: So 683 01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:20.940 sameeha siraj: we have to like, consider that this, like big one, is similar to the other triangle. 684 01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:22.090 sameeha siraj: Yeah. Yeah. 685 01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.810 sameeha siraj: And we see that that's like the 5 of the bigger triangle. Right? 686 01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.650 sameeha siraj: And the relation is that 15 687 01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:34.169 sameeha siraj: divided by 3, is going to be 688 01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:41.860 sameeha siraj: the reason i'm doing 3, dividing it by 3 is cause if it has to be 15 689 01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:47.730 sameeha siraj: and it's gonna be the 5, then you can only divide 3 to get 5, 690 01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.450 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah. so what does that tell you about the rest of the triangle? 691 01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:59.080 sameeha siraj: it tells me, like about the other sides. 692 01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:04.589 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. And so how are you going to use that to get the length of the small one. 693 01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:11.779 sameeha siraj: is this not? I'm kind of confused like, would this be considered? The side like 694 01:24:12.570 --> 01:24:14.860 sameeha siraj: is 5. Correct? 695 01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:16.010 Jenny Duan: No. 696 01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:26.089 Jenny Duan: because 5 is just the ratio, it's not the side length. So whenever you're writing like 3, 4, 5, the length is not actually 5. That's just the ratio between the sides. 697 01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:30.440 Jenny Duan: Maybe it would be helpful if we wrote like 3 x 4 x 5 x 698 01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.199 sameeha siraj: huh? Right here. 699 01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:45.639 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because, yeah, II wanna emphasize that like the 3, 4, 5 is not the actual sidelines. It's the ratio. So yeah, maybe 3 x 4 x 5 x would be like a a more useful way to write. That? 700 01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:55.750 sameeha siraj: then 701 01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:06.070 sameeha siraj: 15. 702 01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:09.709 Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. Seen as the yep, perfect. 703 01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.110 sameeha siraj: And then. 704 01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:16.780 sameeha siraj: okay. So the ratio 705 01:25:18.090 --> 01:25:20.289 sameeha siraj: so DA is 4 706 01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:21.990 Jenny Duan: perfect 707 01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:32.120 sameeha siraj: so 708 01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:39.399 sameeha siraj: this like given side. it should equal 709 01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:44.469 sameeha siraj: to like comply with the ratio. 710 01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.419 sameeha siraj: it should equal 12. 711 01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.769 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect, perfect. You're getting it. 712 01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:57.350 sameeha siraj: And in order to make that equal we'd have to make this one equal to at 8 713 01:25:57.610 --> 01:26:02.960 sameeha siraj: And for that we need to multiply. We need X to equal to 2 714 01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:04.220 sameeha siraj: right? 715 01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:11.410 sameeha siraj: And then that way to find these ones. 716 01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:13.190 sameeha siraj: We can. 717 01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.559 sameeha siraj: We can just do 5 times 2, which is 10. 718 01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.529 Jenny Duan: That's correct, perfect. Okay, do you feel it? Okay. 719 01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:29.209 Jenny Duan: this is such a hard concept. But you got it really quickly. Do you feel like you understand this completely? Or are there any aspects of link. 720 01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:43.849 Jenny Duan: this 3, 4, 5, triangle? Similar triangle situation that you don't understand? Because this is like a couple of different things that they're assessing you on. They're assessing you on your knowledge of right triangles, similar triangles, and like specific right triangles. But do you feel like you understand this? 721 01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:51.639 sameeha siraj: I think definitely like the exes. Help me like kind of organize it better, because I was a bit more confused before. 722 01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:57.690 sameeha siraj: so yeah, I think I understand it. But I don't know. Like, are there any more like 723 01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:01.219 sameeha siraj: triangle ratios about to memorize other than this one 724 01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:07.370 Jenny Duan: like the 45, 45 90, which would just be let me just write that down. 725 01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:08.740 Jenny Duan: It would be like 726 01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:13.530 Jenny Duan: XX, and then x square root. 2. 727 01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:18.399 Jenny Duan: So me draw that 728 01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:22.809 Jenny Duan: like XX 729 01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.239 Jenny Duan: x root 2. 730 01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:36.070 Jenny Duan: This is called 45, 45, 90, and there's also 30, 60, 90, which is 731 01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.330 Jenny Duan: which is x 732 01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.029 Jenny Duan: x 2 XX times square 3. 733 01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:50.709 Jenny Duan: So let me just draw that one 734 01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:56.979 Jenny Duan: But other than these, these are the main 3 that you'll need to know. 735 01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.510 sameeha siraj: Okay. 736 01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:05.990 Jenny Duan: okay. 737 01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:09.460 Jenny Duan: awesome. 738 01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:16.390 Jenny Duan: So do you want to take a screenshot of this? Have you gotten it all written down 739 01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:17.900 cool 740 01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.800 Jenny Duan: before we wrap. There's something I really want to show you. Quickly. 741 01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:26.380 Jenny Duan: and 742 01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:38.159 Jenny Duan: Then we can wrap up. I know it's been a long session today, so thanks for your perseverance. I just wanna get this on your radar because it's 743 01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:46.710 Jenny Duan: the deadlines approaching. And I think you should apply. So this is something called a young arts. Oh, let me, can I share my screen? 744 01:28:47.270 --> 01:29:09.820 Jenny Duan: This is something called young Arts. It's in national arts competition. But one of the things they offer is a film competition. And I think that if you're if you want to seriously enter apply as a film major again to to schools like Usc, Us. And Ucla. You should have some more like film things on your resume and on your activities. So I would like you to apply for this. 745 01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.110 Jenny Duan: And 746 01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:22.689 Jenny Duan: this is just a film competition, the short field. It's for high school students. It's very prestigious. It's national and let me just show you like we can look at Henry Spritz film. 747 01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:26.690 Jenny Duan: We can just look at a couple of seconds of it. We don't have to watch the whole thing. 748 01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:32.170 Jenny Duan: Cause it's quite long. Can you see this? Can you hear the sound or no? 749 01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:39.719 sameeha siraj: I think the sound stopped. 750 01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:45.250 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me share computer stuff. Okay. 751 01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:47.070 Jenny Duan: you're now. 752 01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:48.180 sameeha siraj: yeah. 753 01:29:54.910 --> 01:30:02.390 Jenny Duan: let's just go to the middle. It's a long film. So I'm just gonna skip to the middle to show you what it is. 754 01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:28.489 Jenny Duan: Let's just look at another one. This is not a Psa. 755 01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:32.879 Jenny Duan: This is only 3 min long, so your film doesn't have to be long 756 01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:35.750 from the metaphysical to the physical. 757 01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:41.960 Jenny Duan: metaphysical. 758 01:30:43.520 --> 01:31:00.190 Kingsville. 3 k. 2. Gold blemish blood, dirty, cheap, 3 beautiful elephant figurines carved out of my own life to be mixed, I mean gray, and don't people say black makes them look slim. 759 01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:07.270 Better, more a black brother, father, uncle, cousin, best friend, was shot at. 760 01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:12.789 Jenny Duan: and that's it. Alright. Let's look at one more example. 761 01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:37.910 Jenny Duan: No fan of Andy. This is what's called anyways. The point is to give you some examples of student films. And these are the types of films that you will wanna make for your portfolio if you're applying as a film major. And this is kind of like the quality that you should aim for. I'm gonna just turn the quality up. So it's clear. And this is the type of thing that you'll want on your portfolio 762 01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:39.520 Jenny Duan: when applying. 763 01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:42.830 Wait, can't you? Just 764 01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:55.850 Jenny Duan: there? Let me just jump to the middle again, so you can see before Andy this one happened. Then we split up. This is one is like, has some dialogue in it. 765 01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:09.790 You tore them all down. I was going to 766 01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.550 what happened. 767 01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:17.239 What are you doing? 768 01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:19.780 Jenny Duan: Anyways. 769 01:32:31.730 --> 01:32:34.020 sameeha siraj: my screen is frozen. I think 770 01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:43.340 Ivy Mentors: we're losing 771 01:32:46.390 --> 01:33:15.979 Jenny Duan: okay. Anyways, you can watch it in your own time. But this is just to give you an idea of the types of projects that you might want to think about creating when doing like a film portfolio or just applying as a film major in general. So this next week I want you to just look at this and you can see, like the most competitive films are well edited and showcase, original and clear storytelling, while demonstrating strong elements of character and film. So I want you to think about applying for this award because 772 01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:22.810 Jenny Duan: I feel like. and this is something that you should look into, and something I feel like might be 773 01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:35.590 Jenny Duan: a good thing to have on your resume, and also something fun to do. On your own time. So yeah, it's called young Arts. I'm gonna put a link for this in your doc. So that you're aware of it. But 774 01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:40.910 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's a national art competition. It's very competitive, and I think you should enter 775 01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:53.089 Jenny Duan: it'll take some time, though, if you wanna seriously enter to do film because it's a hard, you know. Category. Are there any like 776 01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:59.060 Jenny Duan: I let's look. 777 01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:12.230 Jenny Duan: I think I remember applying. I also had to do some type of video. I think you have to do like an explanation of your piece. So you have to do the film. And then you, I think you have to write an application 778 01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:21.200 Jenny Duan: an application about you know why you made this, or like the story behind what you made. Let's see. 779 01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:23.540 Jenny Duan: And it has to be a portfolio, too. 780 01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:32.710 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm not actually sure. But I think this week you should make an account, and just take a look at it. 781 01:34:32.810 --> 01:35:01.340 Jenny Duan: The deadline is October eleventh. So that's why it's a bit of a rush you have about a month. If you actually want to do this to shoot and film and again, your video doesn't have to be long. You saw one of the previous winners was only 3 min long. So you don't have to make a long video. It just has to be something that you think is representative of your best work. And you can look at these examples. And I'm sure if you search up on Youtube, if you just search up like young Arts film, you can look at some other submission examples, too. 782 01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:02.510 sameeha siraj: Alright. 783 01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:06.959 Jenny Duan: cool. Yeah. 784 01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.190 Jenny Duan: Take care. 785 01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:14.219 Ivy Mentors: So I mean, what's what's your conclusion on the side? Jenny. 786 01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:16.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think. 787 01:35:17.530 --> 01:35:31.920 Jenny Duan: I think, Huda, I think you should do some more practice throughout the week, and I think my question for you is, do you feel like, what do you feel like? Is your biggest hold? Do you feel like it's content, or do you feel like it's time? I think that's one hypothesis we can test this week. 788 01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:59.500 sameeha siraj: But what do you think definitely like, time is like my biggest issue? For some, like some of the sections like, I think, reading I do pretty well, and like I I think for most of the tests I've done I barely get wrong and like the meeting section. But for like, I think the math section there's like a few. It's just I just get really stuck on. And I need to like spend a lot of time on one question, which I kind of 789 01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:06.029 sameeha siraj: the longer I take, I guess the more like worried I am that I have less time. So 790 01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.200 sameeha siraj: yeah. 791 01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:12.399 Jenny Duan: I feel like what might be helpful for you is 792 01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:36.169 Jenny Duan: to get like someone an SA. Tutor, to just spend 1 h with you every week to just review the questions that you get wrong like I honestly feel like, I don't feel like you are lacking that much content. Wise, for example, grammar. I don't think you're lacking like pretty much at all. You didn't get any questions wrong there. For math, maybe like a couple of things, but II don't think you need to sit in like 793 01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:54.870 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to sit in like a boot camp. Does that make sense like, I don't think you need to be sat and like taught how to do things cause it. Seems like most of the content, is there. I think maybe because every test is a little bit different. To catch those edge cases that you just don't know. Maybe it'd be helpful to have someone. Just sit with you for 1 HA week, and just 794 01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:05.190 Jenny Duan: as you do practice throughout the week, just get compile like a list of the questions that you don't know how to do, and then at the end, just have one person just go over all of them with you at the end of the week. I think 795 01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:24.019 Jenny Duan: that is why I would recommend for you, as well as just more practice throughout the week. So if you can just up the practice and do like 30 min a day at least 30 or 45 min. Just do one section just do like one reading section or one grammar section or one math. No calculator, one math calculator, something like that every single day. I think that will help you a lot. 796 01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:25.780 sameeha siraj: Okay, great. 797 01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:28.900 Thank you. 798 01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:46.430 Ivy Mentors: Jenny? Thanks a lot, I think. La, yeah, you don't worry about my section. Today. I think I just want to like prioritize my, my kids here, and it's good. I also have another new gentleman for you or he's by. He's my younger. 799 01:37:46.490 --> 01:38:12.740 Ivy Mentors: yeah, an anonymous way you can't. You're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're 800 01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:34.529 Jenny Duan: but I will send you a link. And if you have some time, would you be able to do a short video testimonial? It'd be really helpful for other students and just helpful for me to improve as we continue working together. Of course, it's just gonna be like a video recording or an audio recording it'll be a video recording but again, it'll only be shared in like an anonymous and privacy preserving way. 801 01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:46.449 sameeha siraj: Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thank you so much. And yeah, I think I'm gonna talk to your brother now. Feel free to hang out or log off and do something else with your time. Take a break. It's been a long session. Okay, thank you. 802 01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:57.939 Ivy Mentors: Thank you. Thanks. Yeah, Jenny. I think it's fine. I mean, we can actually do our session later. I think it's good that you are like with us both sessions. And Whoa, Whoa! Don't don't play with them. Okay? 803 01:38:58.150 --> 01:39:10.179 Ivy Mentors: So yeah, I'd send you I think, on the on the after. After we speak to over that I'll tell you like 5 min I'll send you something, and you can actually have a look at it, and then we can connect later. So he's aware. 804 01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:19.810 Ivy Mentors: and I think he'll introduce himself. I'm 8 years old. I'm a third grader, and I have my own Youtube channel. 805 01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:24.210 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's awesome. Do you wanna show me your Youtube channel? I'd love to see it. 806 01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:33.549 Ivy Mentors: Okay, let me let me let. Oh, so that's what you are doing. Okay. You know what he was actually playing with this whole thing all this time, and I was like, why is he doing it. He was just getting up to show you 807 01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:34.970 Ivy Mentors: his Youtube channel? 808 01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:45.330 Ivy Mentors: what's the name? Homer ranch kid 809 01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:54.580 Ivy Mentors: branch? Good. Yeah. 810 01:39:58.730 --> 01:40:01.779 Ivy Mentors: no brand. Wait. 811 01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:15.610 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. Why don't you just show me your software. Is that the range? No, no, no, no, no! I think he's probably struggling to use the. you know, like these are like outdated things right 812 01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.950 Ivy Mentors: for for the younger generation.

I'm not sure if I can see your screen. I think it's still 815 01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:35.569 Ivy Mentors: I only see like a new tab. I don't see the Youtube channel. 816 01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.569 Ivy Mentors: Sorry over there, Noah, just give me a sec. 817 01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.459 Ivy Mentors: That's the thing with 818 01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:52.500 Ivy Mentors: for this one. Right? Yeah. 819 01:40:52.910 --> 01:41:03.000 Ivy Mentors: I just thank you for fun. You know. Cool this guy. I don't just, you know, upload videos. And then I just expect a thousand views, all of them. 820 01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:09.630 Ivy Mentors: I just want to entertain people that's so awesome. Congrats on 321 subscribers. 821 01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.810 Ivy Mentors: Oh, I've I'll I've had like 100 subscribers the last year. 822 01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:16.700 Ivy Mentors: I always 823 01:41:16.710 --> 01:41:22.139 Ivy Mentors: video. Oh, no, this kind of had. It's a little scary. 824 01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:24.630 Ivy Mentors: But like, you know. 825 01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:30.099 Ivy Mentors: okay, that's okay from a poppy work. Video. 826 01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:37.490 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I can hear. 827 01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:44.680 Ivy Mentors: And then. Now, that's like my most 90,000, 828 01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:58.600 Ivy Mentors: 39000, no. 390000, sorry. 39,000. Okay, see how how he's a metric guy, you know, like completely metric driven. 829 01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:08.859 Ivy Mentors: And and is this lowest of the year? Designor? Yeah, I did design him. I kind of got some inspiration from some characters and like games. I like. 830 01:42:09.230 --> 01:42:10.200 Ivy Mentors: okay. 831 01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:28.329 Ivy Mentors: is that the agenda after his discussion? Probably not. I think. Yeah. But anyways, II think he's that's how he's that's his identity, right? He wants to be. What do you want to be when you grow up? See what kind of generation you're dealing with, Jenny, you know, that's the thing. 832 01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:29.650 Ivy Mentors: So 833 01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:34.469 Ivy Mentors: anyways, I think, I yeah, okay, say, thanks. You know. Thanks for your time. 834 01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:35.730 Ivy Mentors: So 835 01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:42.950 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think, I just wanted to introduce. Because, yeah, you're such a celebrity now at home. And 836 01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:47.119 Ivy Mentors: also, like I was as as we were thinking and and about 837 01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.680 Ivy Mentors: really like identifying and trying to give better access, you know, for 838 01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:56.679 Ivy Mentors: young students. And you know, kids, you know, to really hone their skills. 839 01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:05.629 Ivy Mentors: I think Omar is no different. I think elementary school is still better, I would say, like, you know, there is some personal care, but still, like, you know, the in terms of just the 840 01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:11.779 Ivy Mentors: access to, you know, different kind of things. It's it's it's slightly hard here. 841 01:43:11.850 --> 01:43:21.940 Ivy Mentors: And I was really figure there, you know I was really trying to see, you know, if there are any early kind of student, and there are a lot of programs right? So I search. And I was surprised like there are like hundreds of 842 01:43:22.050 --> 01:43:33.219 Ivy Mentors: for like as early as like, you know, third grade, second grade. I was like shocked literally. Right? So I said, You know, I don't wanna like jump into this emotional thing and then sign him up for something. I would just probably consult with you 843 01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:41.699 Ivy Mentors: areas that I feel like he's got a Mac for number one definitely is animation and creative creativity skill. Right? He's quite ahead. 844 01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:44.000 Ivy Mentors: He started this when he was 6 years old. 845 01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.230 Jenny Duan: Wow. 846 01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.340 Ivy Mentors: yeah. So thank you. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. 847 01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:51.119 Ivy Mentors: My channel is actually 848 01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:54.390 Ivy Mentors: okay. She can't see it now. But how old is it. 849 01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:11.410 Ivy Mentors: January. 850 01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.239 Ivy Mentors: yeah. So the thing is like, yeah, definitely, like, one of the thing is this animation right? 851 01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:24.200 Ivy Mentors: And again, like knowing, like, how important like it's, it's not really about colleges at the end of the day, but I think also an opportunity to really like. 852 01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:27.580 Ivy Mentors: if this could really be the thing for him to really be that 853 01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:30.149 Ivy Mentors: kind of very kind of 854 01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:50.050 Ivy Mentors: growing to really someone like wonderful right in this particular field. I'm more than happy like, I don't want kids to really pursue. And and most in the age of AI, right? It's all about human intelligence. And and he coined some term today, he said, what was that you just said artistic intelligence 855 01:44:50.050 --> 01:45:05.069 Ivy Mentors: actually never even heard of that? So I think it's good to know. So that's number one like animation is this thing, I think writing comic books, and all that, you know. He's so good at like story, so he'll just pick up a paper and write that kind of you know, story line 856 01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:08.179 Ivy Mentors: you know that you see in studio and all that. 857 01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:27.049 Ivy Mentors: Easily. He'd do that. And I think also, like we had this kind of graduation party. and we we were all like, you're scared to kind of go up on the stage and speak. And this Guy just came and grabbed the mic and started speaking in front of everyone like, you know. So he's got the thing like speaking as well like 858 01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:31.720 Ivy Mentors: quite different than Houda, you know, different personality. 859 01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:44.360 Ivy Mentors: So I think debate creativity stuff. These are the kind of things I'm thinking about. So I don't know. What would you recommend like? And if if there's any like debate definitely debate, I want him to kind of get into public speaking early on 860 01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:51.859 Ivy Mentors: any programs that you're familiar with. I would love him to kind of join or anything on animation and creativity stuff as well. 861 01:45:52.340 --> 01:46:10.050 Jenny Duan: Definitely so a couple of things that come up to mind. I'm when I think about like young young students, and also I love your passion. I love your energy, and I want you to keep that think some of the things that are for to start young. Are are you interested in any sports 862 01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:21.929 Jenny Duan: play basketball. Sarge, I think, like for young students, the things that are really time sensitive are the first number. One thing is like sports. 863 01:46:21.930 --> 01:46:33.709 Jenny Duan: If you want to be an athlete, or if you want to do athletics that, and if you want that to be a central part of your identity or personality or 864 01:46:33.710 --> 01:47:00.560 Jenny Duan: like activities. Now is a good time to start and get good coaches for that, because a lot of the sports. You can't start you can't really start after you're in middle school pretty much otherwise you will not really be like you won't have the same opportunities to be good at them compared with other students. So if you're interested in doing a sport seriously, and if you wanna do a sport for fun, then, obviously, that's awesome. You should totally do it. But if you want to seriously pursue or start a new sport and train at like 865 01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:19.459 Jenny Duan: a national international level then now is the time to think about that. And if that's something that you choose not to do that's awesome. Not everyone has to do sports sports are, you know, like for some people, sports is their passion, and so now is the time they should put more energy into that. But if that's not your passion. Then, obviously, then, you should not do that because that's not your passion 866 01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:35.370 Ivy Mentors: or animation. Yeah, go ahead. I wanna try being a tennis champion, you know. you wanna try being a tennis champion. Okay? Awesome maybe should look into tennis. And then also with tennis tennis looking to squash and pickle ball. 867 01:47:35.470 --> 01:48:00.689 Jenny Duan: squash, pickle, ball, racquetball, Badminton, and any other racket based sport. Tennis is awesome. Tennis is also, there's a lot of tennis players so to stand out as a tennis player is, gonna be harder than to stand out, as say, like a squash or Badminton player, or like ping power. Literally any other racket sport that has less people playing it. You wanna look for a sport that has less people in the field 868 01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:25.419 Jenny Duan: because that'll give you a higher opportunity of being successful. That being said, you also wanna look for a sport where you feel like you have a natural like affinity towards. For example, like water. Polo is a sport where not a lot of people do water polo. But like, for example, if you're if you don't like swimming. Then you shouldn't just do a sport because there's not a lot of people in it. You should do a sport that you really like. So if you really like tennis, and that's how you choose. Then obviously, it's still very possible to be very successful, and you should still do it. 869 01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:41.440 Jenny Duan: So choose something that's at the intersection of what you like and what you think you're good at, and also what not a lot of other people are doing, because that'll give you the highest possibility to stand out for animation and art. There's a lot of things that I think you should think about entering, for example. 870 01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:51.940 Jenny Duan: There's a lot of art contest, animation, contests, film contests, even for young students like you, for example. Every single year there's the Google logo contest. Have you heard about this? 871 01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:53.210 Ivy Mentors: Oh, I do. 872 01:48:53.820 --> 01:49:05.430 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Google, Doodle, the Doodles, Google, Google, Doodle competition. That's kind of a brain teaser. So I think, stuff like that. You should enter 873 01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:32.399 Jenny Duan: And, for example, it wouldn't it be cool to have one of your animations as the Google Logo for a day like. I think that would be awesome, and I think that you should look into things like that and if you just do a search of, for example, like art contest for elementary school students, you should probably get a list of a lot of things like that. Google Doodle comes to the top of my mind. There's other logo contests. 874 01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:44.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. So there's things like the Google Doodle contest. There's other logo design contests. And there's also just other art and animation contests for students. So those are some things that you should look into. Also. 875 01:49:44.600 --> 01:50:11.979 Jenny Duan: you make a public portfolio like once you have a couple of films or animations done. You should start sharing that with and your dad help you with this. I don't think you should run like a public social media by yourself. But if your dad and you can work together to maybe start sharing some of your animations, once you start building a following, like you're doing on Youtube, there will be like brands and other things that wanna work with you. So you could end up doing animations for companies for like small businesses for brands, like 876 01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:23.319 Jenny Duan: doing some of their logo design. Even though you're young, if you have the talent, and obviously you have the talent and the skill. People will want to work with you, and they'll recognize that. So don't think that your age is a barrier, because it's not 877 01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:47.360 Jenny Duan: and then other things that I would look into. Siraj are for like gifted and talented programs at. You know, the middle school level. Sometimes you can test into those. So I'd be mindful of that. I know in Oregon. I don't know about California, but in Oregon, gifted and talented programs. The testing begins in third grade. So third, fourth, fifth grade you're doing testing. So I would look into that. And then also, there's things like 878 01:50:47.770 --> 01:51:03.379 Jenny Duan: Davidson, young scholars. Let me put in the chat. If you want to go an academic route as well. There's a lot of academic programs that you can look into for young students like Center for talented youth. This is called Johns Hopkins. 879 01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.930 Jenny Duan: There's also Davidson, young scholars, things like that 880 01:51:07.230 --> 01:51:12.870 Jenny Duan: rise for the future, which are a prize for for the future. 881 01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:38.850 Jenny Duan: Diana, award things like this, which are a lot of which are prestigious competition, slash awards for young people that want to make a difference in the world. So if you take your animation to the next level, you can use it for, like different public awareness campaigns to raise awareness on different social issues. You can use it to, you know, educate people on things that you're passionate about, that. You feel like, the world needs to hear. For example, if what you care about is 882 01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:54.599 Jenny Duan: environmental advocates, you can make you know animations about that, and combine your passion for animation with something else that can make a change in the world. Or if your passion is like cultural awareness, or if your passion is healthcare education, something like that you can combine your 883 01:51:54.830 --> 01:52:01.619 Jenny Duan: your passions for animation, and also for another campaign. Another thing is, Khan Academy 884 01:52:02.730 --> 01:52:24.739 Jenny Duan: has a video making competition. I'm not sure if this is limited to high school students, so I will need to verify this. But if it's open to younger students, you will have the opportunity to make an educational video about some subject that you're interested in. So maybe you're interested in math, you can in these concepts. They don't have to be super difficult. They just you just have to be able to explain them in a way that 885 01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:37.250 Jenny Duan: you can teach people. So if you're able to take any concept. It doesn't have to be hard. It could be anything from, you know, algebra, chemistry, science, something that you're interested in and make a video like a 2 min video on it. You could win 886 01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:48.229 Jenny Duan: like a pretty big award. So there's, you know, awards you can enter. And then for public speaking. I think speech and debate starts at the middle school level. So is speech and debate something that you'd be interested in, do you think? 887 01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:52.289 Ivy Mentors: Oh, yeah, awesome. Can I join young arts? 888 01:52:52.440 --> 01:53:03.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, young hearts, I think you can join. I think young hearts might only be for high school. By the way, he's completely like ultra competitive guy. Awesome. That's awesome. 889 01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:14.030 Jenny Duan: I think young art is only for high school students. But I think scholastic arts and writing you can join here. Let me look into this really quickly. 890 01:53:14.050 --> 01:53:19.390 Ivy Mentors: How do you know all of this? I'm so amazed, you know, like it's like it's like on your fingertips, you know, Jenny. 891 01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:33.439 Jenny Duan: I have. This is like one of my passions like that. I just I've always been thinking about. So I think I think arts and writing can. I'm gonna check if you can do, young students. 892 01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:42.640 Jenny Duan: I am not sure what the age limit is, though it might be middle. I know middle schoolers can do it. I don't know if elementary schoolers can do it. 893 01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:45.169 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you have to be 13 enough 894 01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:56.070 Jenny Duan: 13. So I think you're still a little bit young, but you know something to keep on the radar and then there's also different public speaking competitions. 895 01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:59.790 Jenny Duan: even for young students. 896 01:53:59.850 --> 01:54:22.559 Jenny Duan: So let me just do a quick search. And there's also like video competitions. So if you like, want to make a video or like a Psa on something we could also combine like passion for animation and public speaking. So you can make an animation do a voiceover for that, and then you can practice both of those skills. By the way, today. 897 01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:42.549 Ivy Mentors: he he just hits a noisy room, you know, it's like, well, I need my studio already, like, yeah, in the studio. Wow! He uses my closet as a studio. So he comes in, and so awesome. Let me just put a link into the chat and feel free to just look at this in your own time 898 01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.839 Jenny Duan: might be a Uk list. Sorry. 899 01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:57.610 Jenny Duan: Never mind, disregard this. Let me give you a new list. I want to give you a Us. List has been on his list, you know. He's been. He's been like torturing everyone to go to Uk. Huh? 900 01:54:57.670 --> 01:55:02.279 Ivy Mentors: This, I mean, if you join this competition, we'll all come over with you. 901 01:55:02.970 --> 01:55:08.090 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is just a list of it's a list of different competitions. You can look into. It's like 902 01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:13.700 Jenny Duan: competitions for public speaking, reading aloud poetry, things like that. Yeah. 903 01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:25.969 Ivy Mentors: amazing. I mean, I was really like not really thinking about competitions. It was more like to prep. Right? I think it's a good time for him to prepare. But I mean competitions definitely are a good way to prepare in some ways right? It's just like. 904 01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.270 Ivy Mentors: right? So. 905 01:55:28.590 --> 01:55:30.769 Jenny Duan: totally. So, I think, yeah. 906 01:55:30.830 --> 01:56:00.010 Jenny Duan: just doing. I think competitions is mainly because it gives. The thing about competitions is not actually about winning the award. It's more about giving yourself a platform to showcase your work, or for other people to see your work, because when you enter a competition, obviously like you're presenting in front of a lot of people. So it's just the practice of you know, delivering your work, or doing a public speech, or something to a large audience of people. So oh, also, you can look into doing like 907 01:56:00.670 --> 01:56:26.670 Jenny Duan: different, like public speaking engagements in your own community, too. For example, if you have like a festival, or if you have, you know, a party like a celebration. Maybe you can volunteer to like, give a speech there, and also just have those opportunities to practice, or in your school in your elementary school. If you have an opportunity to like, give a speech to frame your school for like a fundraiser, or for you know, something like that, you can also maybe try to volunteer and see if you're able to do that, too. 908 01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:34.369 Ivy Mentors: if I try doing a sticker raffle. But I'm still not able to make the stickers. I can make a sticker. But I'm still too lazy to make a stickers. 909 01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:36.320 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. 910 01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:46.640 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think I think he's going to like, you know. I mean again, because this is such a. In fact, you know, communities like ours where there isn't really like good access to everything right, like a lot of people do it. 911 01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:58.909 Ivy Mentors: You know, the funny thing is, lot of the people who stay here actually all like work in great companies and all that. I think people just move here during Covid because of, you know, like bigger space to live. And you know, like 912 01:56:59.170 --> 01:57:12.420 Ivy Mentors: the houses are good, and you know the people like hardly thought about the other implications. But it's a new community. And the problem is now like people come together. There's a lot of voluntary work happening. So Omar didn't like a public schools thing or thing. Just start. 913 01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:40.830 Ivy Mentors: You're going to one right on a weekly basis. Someone's running like a nonprofit thing. Correct. The whole idea like going somewhere meaning some random. But I in school like, it's a lot in my school class. There's a lot of annoying kids. Okay, I think we can talk about that. Okay, cool. I think that's fine. I think we can. I just wanted to kind of like, you know. Motivate him number one meet. 914 01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:56.300 Ivy Mentors: Have you also beat? By the I mean I still oh, I have. I need to ask my older daughter to meet you as well like, you know. Might be she'll get some good tips as well. But okay, Omar say, thank you. I wanna wrap up. She's it's been a long day for her, like we, we've used literally 2 h, 3 h of her time today. 915 01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:05.030 Ivy Mentors: Have fun. Good luck with your Youtube channel. It's looking amazing and keep up the good work 916 01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:10.540 Ivy Mentors: you're so passionate about, like, even like, you know, elementary and middle schoolers more than high schoolers, I see. 917 01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:34.550 Jenny Duan: I think. I think elementary schoolers are awesome, because, you know, they still have a lot of their passion. I think sometimes high schools lose passion for things, not your sister. Your sister is very passionate, but other high schoolers, you know, don't always heard that. Elementary schools are schoolers are cool. He came back. 918 01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:37.580 Ivy Mentors: Okay, Worsley, thank you again. 919 01:58:38.770 --> 01:58:40.340 Nice to meet. You. 920 01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.219 Ivy Mentors: Say. Nice to meet you as well. Nice to meet you as well. 921 01:58:43.410 --> 01:58:48.650 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I mean, honestly, like, I'm actually planning now, now that I know all the landscape 922 01:58:48.930 --> 01:59:06.119 Ivy Mentors: in some ways, I want to really solve and want to make like I want to really show I'm I'm so passionately committed that public schoolers with people like yourselves help can actually make it. But you know within me like. I also know that. Okay, I don't want to repeat the same mistake for my son now. 923 01:59:06.210 --> 01:59:11.569 Ivy Mentors: right because I've kind of II just feel like there is so many things that are unfortunately not 924 01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:13.939 Ivy Mentors: available like, it's often. 925 01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:18.279 Ivy Mentors: yeah, thanks. Jenny, how are you doing otherwise? 926 01:59:18.690 --> 01:59:22.270 Jenny Duan: I'm pretty good. I've been really, really busy, like 927 01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:41.500 Jenny Duan: I have my tool. Do list is like endless right now. But I've taken a look at your document, and I should be able to mark comments today. I think that got to market strategy I've been thinking about with Korea market is doing the webinars, and I think that partnering with international schools might be a good way to target, because if we're able to like. 928 01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:58.880 Jenny Duan: I don't know exactly what this would look like. But I did some research, and it seems like other organizations. Some things. What they do is they just partner with the school, and then the school will give them inbound and like recommend their service and maybe they'll do like a free webinar at their school or something, and then the school will just like help them promote their service. 929 01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:08.619 Jenny Duan: So that's a way to get like targeted international customers. If we just promote 2 international schools or just doing like just targeted Korea Webinar. 930 02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:14.670 Jenny Duan: and like. yeah. And then I could help like, maybe with that. 931 02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:17.179 Ivy Mentors: I mean, that is impressive. Right? 932 02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:30.079 Ivy Mentors: And honestly, like this whole product. Strategy was just for you, right to kind of take a stab at it, and I'm not a big fan of strategy, and I think specially you will see this when you work at tech companies like, I think, Mackenzie. And 933 02:00:30.150 --> 02:00:41.409 Ivy Mentors: you know, mainly, Mackenzie. I think the people have spent so much money on, and I think they just find like, with all due respect, I think tech companies really help Mackenzie and kind of strategist, right? They kind of use for certain roles. 934 02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:50.140 Ivy Mentors: But the point is like, unless you do it unless you get to market. And I think that's something very uniquely. You're very gifted. Because when you talk about like a strategic role, everyone would be like, Okay. 935 02:00:50.310 --> 02:01:13.759 Ivy Mentors: it's like someone who's very good at making Powerpoint and Dex. And you know, like there are certain people who are like that is what great at it like. That's their Nac. I think Shashi is one of those guys as an example right? He's like consultant. He works at ebay M. And a Vcs like investors, and all that. But I think going to market. So I'm honestly like that was just for just a framework for us to think about, and also gave me an opportunity to start thinking on. How am I thinking about the strategy. 936 02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:21.269 Ivy Mentors: But you have actually nailed. And you've identified. The more I've been like thinking and brainstorming. We have to really focus on 2 customer segments. 937 02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:36.039 Ivy Mentors: Number one is really mensio and number 2 is Nilima. I think this is where lot of opportunity for innovation, lot of opportunity for also revenue potential right and making a real impact is available. And there's a lot of underserved need. 938 02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:38.960 Ivy Mentors: Because when you think about late in the game, yeah, sorry God. 939 02:01:39.090 --> 02:02:07.699 Jenny Duan: I was gonna say, for we could do like a panel like public school, to to elite schools something like that, like half like Aaron, have students like other public school students with the same background and panel, specifically that try to get public school student, public bay area tech company students like parents work in tech company, maybe don't know a lot about the admissions process, but want to help their kids have the money to help their kids. That's the need to do a panel. They can see the impact 940 02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:15.379 Ivy Mentors: absolutely. I think you nailed it. It's music to yours, you remember. Like, when you told me, mensio as well. What did I say, we just need hyper specificity. 941 02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:25.870 Ivy Mentors: and I think qualifying, even like introducing you and a bunch of other mentors as a panel and say, How do you get into Iv. Or how do you get into Stanford is where the money is? 942 02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:32.699 Ivy Mentors: Because we don't, I mean, honestly, the more I'm thinking might be. The name is Stanford mentors. It's not even Iv mentors anymore. 943 02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:48.780 Ivy Mentors: Right? It could very well be Stanford mentors, because Stanford is still like that kind of premium school that probably has so much beyond just the Iv brand to it like the level to it. But I think Stanford mentors is harder to scale, because Stanford, you know, they only take like 944 02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:53.799 Jenny Duan: a small small class. And so we're not gonna be able to get as many students as if we broaden it. 945 02:02:53.910 --> 02:03:11.989 Ivy Mentors: And I think Iv sales is something that we have proven right. See? The more I'm trying to leave. Iv, I'm not able to, because that's what resonates with people like, especially with Korea. If you remove Iv, it's not gonna sell right? Ivy is like an emotional thing like you looked into that article right? Any article. And I think I've been really deep into this keyword research. 946 02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:29.769 Ivy Mentors: or what are students searching? Because that's how I wanna brand my even 360 ss, and all that honestly like. That's not what people are searching for, like people are searching. What are my chances? How do I get into Xyz. What is my profile like an application review and things like that? Anyways, I'm working on that. But I'm very happy on the second point that you mentioned. 947 02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:42.049 Ivy Mentors: See, that is how I'm thinking. You know, you remember, like, it was all about enabling Iv access to everybody. But it's not even Ib access. It's about enabling the private level kind of support. 948 02:03:42.070 --> 02:04:05.719 Ivy Mentors: you know, to every student, right? Especially the public student public school student. And it could really be in that area where you have this magnet schools, or very competitive schools as well, that are under served as as an initial kind of very niche segment right? We could really uplift, you know, people who are just there, and they are not able to make it because they don't know certain strategies or tricks and tips. You know, things like that. 949 02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:24.350 Ivy Mentors: So love it. Yeah, I think, II just feel like with tech, you know. Again, I have an unfair market advantage, and I would love to tap into that. And I can clearly see again. I'm surprised how many parents you know. I have, like almost 1111 in my network, who really want to talk to me. 950 02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:33.510 Ivy Mentors: Even today I had a meeting. It's just that I'm trying to like, really build that a very good landing page with all the nice signals so that they can just go and they can be driven 951 02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:59.239 Ivy Mentors: but it is going to happen. But I think Korea is something where Jenny, on the strategy as well. What I would recommend is like a do. Don't be bothered about the strategy paper. You don't have to fill it. Okay, it was just like a. It was just my thought on, how am I seeing the strategy? Right? I use that framework from Apple mostly it's an apple framework on how to really think about contrasting and starting different creating like new value, creating new experiences. 952 02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:12.330 Ivy Mentors: and I was like, I don't want to be another crimson, I mean, look at their deck and slides I've given you is the same story, right? Everyone's got the same story, holistic profile, strategic planning, tailored assistance, 101 comfort and all that. I think 953 02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:32.359 Ivy Mentors: this is where it's so important that specificity is where the money is and the specificity city has to be ultra amazing. So awesome. So I think, let's do this call in like one or 2 session. And and I mean again, as I said, I'm not a big. I'm not a big believer in number of hours. As long as there is impact on value. And I've seen that 954 02:05:32.650 --> 02:05:39.440 Ivy Mentors: I just want to crack the Korean market. And if you can really help identify. And you tell me, Suraj, okay. 955 02:05:39.690 --> 02:06:09.050 Ivy Mentors: For example, like, I don't expect you to know the Korean competitive landscape right? But I did speak to Anne. By the way, and I'm speaking to her. And, by the way, is in the Stanford entrepreneurial kind of thing, right? So she's she's very kind of Vc kind of profile, and and also she's economics, right? So she's now going to become a senior, and she's very well she's coming. She also comes from Hong Kong, right? So she followed that path of coming to a boarding school here. That kind of thing. So she's very familiar with that background. 956 02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:22.700 Ivy Mentors: So what we could do is is. See? At the end of the year, the owner, you're the you're the strategist and everything else right? So I just wanna make sure that you don't feel like oh, if I put in something like if I be, then I'll have to do it. You don't have to do it. You just have to be the lead 957 02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:29.340 Ivy Mentors: and help me really find what's the right way to go there and tell me what is the right strategy? Right? 958 02:06:29.670 --> 02:06:52.829 Jenny Duan: I think Korea Webinar as soon as possible, I think. Give mince referral bonus if she can refer like However, many people, I don't know how we want to do this, but, like maybe, like per, every person who converts from Lindsay because they like, give her free session, give her like incentive, give her some incentive to help convert like free session. Maybe like 959 02:06:52.880 --> 02:07:02.730 Jenny Duan: you can just give her like, I think a free session is better than cash incentive. Sometimes you will do like referral. You get $25, but I think free session. I don't know if that's more valuable for her. 960 02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:24.220 Jenny Duan: give mensio Referral a referral credit, because Minto seems to have she, and she already seems to be doing this for free like she seems to be, you know, telling people about the service, and I think she's a pretty big advocate already, so I think she will be open to doing that. So get Minto to like share with her friends or her school, or like something like that. And I think 961 02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.350 Jenny Duan: we should aim for, like. 962 02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:34.659 Jenny Duan: I think, 25 to 50 families or students to join on a panel like Korea students, and I think that will be enough to get like 963 02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:37.170 Jenny Duan: a significant number of conversions. 964 02:07:37.260 --> 02:08:02.880 Ivy Mentors: I agree, II think, by the way, I've already done that right. So it's I already told her, like a 30 min extra session with Jenni on extra curriculars or college app anything of that sort. I even gave her like one session free with. Anne. I I've told her, because you know, she's economics, right and international relations, and I've already all always said so. I think she's probably in a different zone now, right like she's already like so so swarmed with her. 965 02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:08.129 Ivy Mentors: I don't think that has necessarily been an incentivize like that's been a strong incentive for her. 966 02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.510 Ivy Mentors: Got it? But honestly. 967 02:08:10.650 --> 02:08:14.439 Ivy Mentors: I don't even mind giving her like you know 968 02:08:14.710 --> 02:08:25.459 Ivy Mentors: instead of spending money on a marketing campaign or things of that sort, I would rather give it to some agent like, you know, a mensio who can be an advocate, and she can really bring us, 969 02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:29.460 Ivy Mentors: very organically, like, you know, very highly qualified target right? 970 02:08:29.490 --> 02:08:34.970 Ivy Mentors: So happy to look into that. And II think that will be a part of the strategy, but also like international schools. 971 02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:46.059 Ivy Mentors: right? So whatever, based on whatever information you have your friends, right? You, you know, basically put the blueprint there. And you tell me that this is how I believe that we will be able to crack this market. 972 02:08:46.260 --> 02:09:11.349 Ivy Mentors: and what and you know, based on your intelligence around like the public schools there, what is the underserved segment there as well, right like underserved service as well like, you know. Extracurricular is what her mom said, and things like that. So make your assumptions put a hypothesis. Come with a very like, you know, strong hypothesis, and say, I believe if we do, Xyz will be able to crack this market. Come with that, and let's start with that. I'm a firm believer of doing. That 973 02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:12.750 Ivy Mentors: sounds good. 974 02:09:13.050 --> 02:09:31.140 Ivy Mentors: exactly, I think. Let's do that. And I think also in in Bay Area, I think. Meanwhile, I think 360 assess or like whatever I'm gonna call it. Now it's gonna happen. So I will start getting these leads. And how do we position is something that I would love to explore. But I would still put Korea as as top of 975 02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:40.870 Ivy Mentors: the thing. But I think Korea and public school we can do in parallel. Anyways, I want to be respectful of your time. We've already spent too much time, but I just want to tell you what I'm working on heads down now. Right? 976 02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:42.330 Ivy Mentors: So, thank you. 977 02:09:42.590 --> 02:09:57.100 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. So and and and then we can really, like, you know, focus on one or 2 days. And see. So really at the end of the day. And this is like with Maddie back and forth, and all that, I think, landing Page, I think we need more and more social proof. 978 02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:07.210 Ivy Mentors: But I wouldn't just say like social proof in terms of just testimonial. That's the easiest thing to do. By the way, like, you know, you can cook up. You can create. You can put a fake name and Id and all that stuff. I don't want to do that. 979 02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:10.140 Ivy Mentors: Where I feel like we are lagging is 980 02:10:10.210 --> 02:10:29.930 Ivy Mentors: I want to really show that problem solution, that concept that we spoke about like it has to come out. What is this? 360 assess? It's not just a report, right? So I've been thinking about what the outline is. And let's say, for example, like. And again, how are we gonna name it as something I'm Con constantly. And now you just said hacks in one of your thing today, and I just put hacks. 981 02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:44.600 Ivy Mentors: It has to. Really, isn't it a senior coming in like, okay, this is my final stretch. And I wanna have a session with someone. I'm gonna pay $500. What am I getting out of it? That hook? I need to understand. It can be it, and people are searching for chance. Me! 982 02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:48.000 Ivy Mentors: How do I get? How do I boost my profile? Blah! Blah! Blah! 983 02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:52.320 Ivy Mentors: So this is the outline. See, as an example number one. 984 02:10:52.370 --> 02:11:04.890 Ivy Mentors: So real sessions, real strategies, real desserts. Okay? So I've basically taken, even though she's kind of a junior. Now, I'm basically using the because if you think about the strategies that Ann laid out for her was really 30 days, 60 days plan. 985 02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:09.030 Ivy Mentors: So we are saying, Okay, these are the these are like. These are like real session. 986 02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:24.269 Ivy Mentors: Then talking about the report itself right? And this will come, so I'll be preparing a pitch for every service, and what I'll do is in my testimonial section. I'll put a flash where the things will keep changing or people can click next like this so that they see what the product is. 987 02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:36.120 Ivy Mentors: Then next identifying the hidden strength right like, what are we finding then, you know, finding the top weak spots and then working on like, how are we giving the Taylor strategy to fix it 988 02:11:36.420 --> 02:12:01.429 Ivy Mentors: right, and then showing what is the success? And this is this is where we have to be creative because we have to show the past success and say that we believe in this because this is what the admission officers look for, or just say that this is this is something that is the last resort, like, what else can someone do? So I'm working on this. And similarly like, you know, for for the the next one I'll I'll do a similar thing for your kind of 360 assess as well. 989 02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:06.889 Ivy Mentors: And I'm gonna share this with you. I think the landing page 990 02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:25.180 Ivy Mentors: I feel like we just need to focus on to hook service right? $500, $500, 499. Just land and pick one, I think. Once parents sign for one. I have, I'm confident, and they will look at the roadmap, and they'll sign up like Neilim as a good example. Right? So that is, that is my thinking right now. 991 02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:30.809 Ivy Mentors: But feel free to work on the strategy, and I will share this with you offline. And then you can actually 992 02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:36.060 coming, I mean, what do you think about it like, are you getting my idea like, how how we're planning to do it? 993 02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:39.909 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, this makes sense to me, yeah. 994 02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:47.840 Ivy Mentors: And then below this, what's gonna happen is like, we'll put the testimonial of prica. And you know Shashi as well 995 02:12:48.140 --> 02:13:09.710 Ivy Mentors: right like. So then, when someone looks at like my friend when it looks at this. Wow! They're already like these Asian migrant parents like. And I'm saying that this guy is actually this parent is also an Iv grad. Hands on people like, you know. So you see, like the social proof is a complex situation for a parent. And that's what actually Neilima liked as well. She was sold to, and she looked at the 996 02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:20.110 Ivy Mentors: profile. Right? The report! And this is staying lot of time, right? Because, it, it has to be very carefully crafted. And people are, gonna look at things that that's gonna hit the nail. And 997 02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:22.219 Ivy Mentors: that is what I'm focused on anyways. 998 02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:39.859 Ivy Mentors: Great all good thanks. So much for your time today for Huda, and also porumar. He's excited as well. So so where do you wanna catch up? I think. Yeah, you can put some thought on both the Korean, I think, feel free to put on Neil as well, I think. Let's do that as well. 999 02:13:39.930 --> 02:13:52.909 Jenny Duan: okay, let's do. Tuesday evening. Wednesday evening would be best Monday. I, since we already have Anushka's. I don't have time for another one. But Tuesday I should be good. 1000 02:13:53.040 --> 02:14:05.549 Ivy Mentors: I mean Tuesday, or even if you wanted to. Wednesday is fine, but I think for me right now, priority is to take this live. So I'm gonna work on that. And I think that's where I'll probably ping you and say, Hey, have a quick look if there's anything you want me to strengthen, strengthen it 1001 02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:10.269 Ivy Mentors: so let's keep tentatively Tuesday. But if you want to move it to Wednesday, I'm perfectly fine. 1002 02:14:10.630 --> 02:14:12.670 Ivy Mentors: And last thing. 1003 02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:20.690 Ivy Mentors: On your internships, let's get back to that. Honestly, the the guy did not respond to me, and I did not follow up with him. I need to go back. 1004 02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:24.600 Ivy Mentors: I do have a few ideas in mind. By the way, okay. 1005 02:14:24.610 --> 02:14:28.510 Ivy Mentors: so when you, when is your internship start date target start date. 1006 02:14:29.230 --> 02:14:31.739 Jenny Duan: I could start anytime, like. 1007 02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:37.269 Jenny Duan: probably mid June. But if if there's a strict start date in May, I can also go in May, too. 1008 02:14:37.970 --> 02:14:39.940 Ivy Mentors: Okay, so this is for next year. May 1009 02:14:40.110 --> 02:14:41.979 Jenny Duan: next year, next year, June. 1010 02:14:42.230 --> 02:14:49.690 Jenny Duan: But May is okay if it's required. But ideally, mid June is the start date mid June to September to late September. 1011 02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:53.160 Ivy Mentors: I didn't know that. So why are we doing this so early then? 1012 02:14:53.610 --> 02:14:56.540 Jenny Duan: Because tech cycle recruiting starts. Now. 1013 02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:58.150 Ivy Mentors: okay, yeah, yeah. 1014 02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:21.540 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think for the big companies, it does start right now. I think December is the time correct? Like November, December is probably the time, Jan to to to secure. But now is the time to apply. Okay, so this is really for next summer. Correct next summer. Okay, okay, it's very funny, because, you know, I actually was working with another Cmu girl actually, who got a very good internship with an AI startup. And and she was doing, okay, cool. 1015 02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:28.090 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, let's let's do that. And I think once I meet you, I was also what I wanted to do was like, you know. 1016 02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:47.350 Ivy Mentors: just have a blast in my network, even though I'm in sales. I could always say that, hey, I've I've been working with this 2 amazing like, you know. kind of interns at my startup. Pm, and you know, please, I mean I will. I'll keep it anonymous. But I'll just kind of create that thing where people will reach out. Hey, wow! That's amazing. Like Stanford, pm, interns. 1017 02:15:47.370 --> 02:15:52.020 Ivy Mentors: you know. So so I want to do that. I wanted to consult with you before I do that. 1018 02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:59.200 Ivy Mentors: That's why II think it's it's gonna take time. So let's let's just strategize that as well when we meet. Okay. 1019 02:15:59.690 --> 02:16:01.380 Jenny Duan: sounds good. Thank you so much. 1020 02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.540 Ivy Mentors: Thank you. Thank you very much. 1021 02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:11.799 Jenny Duan: Perfect. All good. Right. See? You see it. See you? Yeah. Tomorrow, I mean, Anushka probably join or not. But I'll keep this thing 1022 02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:19.649 Ivy Mentors: and Tuesday I'll just go ahead and I'll book what? 5, 30 to 6 30 is okay for Tuesday. Cool. Thank you. 1023 02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:21.560 Ivy Mentors: Bye, bye.",

How are you? 3 00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.959 Jenny Duan: I'm good. I'm good. 4 00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.570 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. 5 00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:43.940 Ivy Mentors: just waiting for Huda. Thanks. yeah, I think we can. Probably I'll like, I mean, if it's okay, like, we can probably do an hour today, like, you know, if you have time like, I would love to have like a few more sessions. If that's okay. 6 00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.649 Ivy Mentors: because I also like, there's something that which I wanted to kind of connect with you on. So let's just focus on Hudana. And then 7 00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:05.830 Ivy Mentors: sure, sure, no problem. So an hour for who that today, instead of 450, no, I mean for us, I said. 45, or even like an hour, is fine. I mean, I think it depends on the sat and other things that she has. So I will let you talk. Then I'll probably just like 8 00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.659 Ivy Mentors: jump in in the middle, like for the sad thing. 9 00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.030 Ivy Mentors: But yeah, please get started. 10 00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.090 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Hi, hooda, how's it going? 11 00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.240 sameeha siraj: Hi! It's going good! How are you? 12 00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.560 Jenny Duan: I'm good. I was thinking 13 00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:38.649 Jenny Duan: So I was talking to your dad. And he said that we could do a little bit more focus on sat today. So I was thinking, we could just do updates really quickly, because they still just wanna hear what you've been up to? But then, after that, we can just focus on doing sat for the rest of the session. How does that sound to you? That sounds great. 14 00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.190 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. So, yeah, just 15 00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.490 Jenny Duan: ",
    "what are some of your updates? 16 00:01:45.100 --> 00:02:11.450 sameeha siraj: Essay? And we'll we'll talk about that in our second session this week. So I just wanna make sure that you know, I haven't forgotten that I've seen that we'll talk about that later. But yeah, go ahead. Yeah. So I made like the first draft for the essay, and I got like the video editing program downloaded on this computer. And I was actually just editing it before this 17 00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.240 sameeha siraj: and then 18 00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:24.769 sameeha siraj: I guess I I'm planning like my first meeting for Filmmakers Club. And like we're making the slideshow and stuff so that we can hold it this week. And then 19 00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.310 sameeha siraj: I think 20 00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.459 sameeha siraj: I haven't been able to like film any of the interviews yet, but I think my first one is gonna be in like 21 00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.909 sameeha siraj: next to next weekend 22 00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:47.050 sameeha siraj: and I think we started working on like the slideshow for our 23 00:02:47.470 --> 00:03:07.799 sameeha siraj: for empowering AI, and like, we're about like 10 slides in we just kind of finish like the foundational like, what is computer science like, why should you be learning this like, what are we doing? And we plan like a cahoot that we're gonna make at the end, which is kinda like quizzing on like python 24 00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.580 sameeha siraj: and stuff. So, yeah. 25 00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.369 Jenny Duan: okay, this is all awesome. I have a question about folklift. How is the progress on the website looking like the Folklift website. 26 00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.250 sameeha siraj: I think we need to put more time into that actually, cause I haven't been able to work on it at all much. 27 00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.689 sameeha siraj: I think I'm kind of struggling like in the creation of it, cause I don't know how to make it like I guess.",
    " 28 00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.269 sameeha siraj: like more flexible and stuff, because I've just been making it using like HTML, css, in Javascript. 29 00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.430 But I feel like I should be using more complicated things which is kinda like holding me back. 30 00:03:49.330 --> 00:04:06.909 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you should try. I think you should look into react I think, react. Js, is, it's I mean, it's basically just Javascript. But react is like a lot more responsive to work with. And what I like personally about react is it's 31 00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:22.419 Jenny Duan: it's good for Mobile and for web, because I know a lot of HTML, Css. Javascript. Is not that good for Mobile like with the spacing and everything you need to add a lot of Flexbox and and all of that. But I think for react if you build it. 32 00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:32.440 Jenny Duan: it it's more responsive for webin mobile. So you should look into that, and it's not too hard to learn. I don't think, especially if you already know. HTML javascript and css. 33 00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.859 Jenny Duan: so I'll just look. I'll just make a note on that. 34 00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:59.149 sameeha siraj: Oh, also I had a question about early college, so I was wondering, should I sign up for, like an articulate course, which I kinda accounts for. High school credits that way. I'll have like high school credits out of the way, and I could take more Ap's next year. So I was like wondering if I should take I think English ap 35 00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:09.850 sameeha siraj: this summer. Or not. Summer, I think spring semester, so that so that way, like, I'll have that credit, those credits out of the way, and then I'll be able to take more. Ap's 36 00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.780 sameeha siraj: and senior year. 37 00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:35.460 Jenny Duan: I think that sounds good. Yeah, I think because Ap's have more weight on your Gpa. I think you should try to prioritize those more, and then, with ",
    "Ap's in your senior year, you should sign up with as many for as many as you think you can handle in the first semester, because in the second semester it doesn't actually matter if you take the test or not, because it'll be after you get accepted into your college. 38 00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:49.619 Jenny Duan: so it doesn't matter if you actually take the test at the end. But what matters is in that first semester, like how many Ap's can you successfully handle? So I think that's the goal to like. Try to sign up for as many as you can handle in semester one, and then semester 2. Honestly, it doesn't 39 00:05:49.660 --> 00:06:10.460 Jenny Duan: like. The honest answer is, it doesn't really matter what your grades are as long as you don't fail like, unless it's for yourself personally, like, I know people who've gotten into Stanford, and then second semesters in a year that got C's, and like, it's not like your college is going to rescind you. Unless you fail, don't fail a class. Then you know your admissions could get revoked. But if you get Bs in your second semester. No one's going to like. 40 00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:24.880 Jenny Duan: If you're a straight, a student, get B's. No one's gonna be like, oh, we're gonna kick you out of the school that you got accepted to so second semester senior year is really low pressure. It's mostly just, however, many you think you can handle in your first semester. Yeah, does that make sense? 41 00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:34.990 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And so I put down these specific goals from folklift. I'm just gonna copy paste. Goals from last time, because I feel like they're still pretty 42 00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.650 Jenny Duan: pretty similar. 43 00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.869 Jenny Duan: and do you have an update on the video game project? 44 00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:53.029 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah, so I started or like not started. But I implemented like dialogue into the into the classification scene. So kinda like 45 00:06:5",
    "3.050 --> 00:06:59.029 sameeha siraj: it like makes sense in the game play now? And then I started 46 00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:14.339 sameeha siraj: working on like Was it the like? The exposition scenes where? It kind of like introduced like what the problem is, and kind of explains like what's going on. So like, I started writing the dialogue and the code for that as well. 47 00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:28.730 sameeha siraj: And like I made a spreadsheet for Ada Lovelace. And I'm working on one for car, for like I think I was, gonna add Carol Shaw, who made like the first atari, I think, so, yeah. 48 00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:37.380 Jenny Duan: okay, amazing. Sounds good. Okay. So I think we can pause here. Do you have any urgent questions before we move on to SAT. Things. 49 00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:52.889 sameeha siraj: So for for community college, do you think I should stick with just a courses that are articulate from my high school credits? Or do you think I should also take like the film class cause? I don't know if I should. 50 00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.540 sameeha siraj: They continue, both of them. 51 00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:02.549 Jenny Duan: Oh, I see what you mean. Do you plan on applying as a film, major at schools? Is that still your intention? 52 00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:20.349 sameeha siraj: Only like a few like, just for like, just for a chance, maybe apply to like Usc or Nyu for film. But I think, for, like Stanford and UC. Berkeley and such. I won't apply for like data science and AI ethics. 53 00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:35.010 Jenny Duan: Okay? Awesome. Then, yeah, I would still take the film class, because for Usc. And Nyu, if you want to apply for film, you need to have a portfolio. And so you should have like a couple of movies or things under your belt that you can show in your portfolio. 54 00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:43.920 Jenny Duan: Okay? Sounds good. So yeah, I would still stick with your phone class in addition to anything else that you would want to take.",
    " 55 00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.650 Jenny Duan: But yeah, keep your phone class. 56 00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.890 sameeha siraj: Okay, thank you. No problem. 57 00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:56.520 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then, yeah, I would be mindful of just thinking about your portfolio, and 58 00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.539 Jenny Duan: thinking about like what you would want to enter for that. And 59 00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:29.360 Jenny Duan: well, I think that's something that we can send some time on in a different session. But yeah, if you are like, seriously considering planning to apply as a film major to Usc and Nyu, which are like very competitive film schools. Then you should have like a pretty strong portfolio. That you'll need to prepare this year, and next summer. Cool. So for the sat wh what would be easiest for you? We can do just broad concept review, or we can go over questions that you've missed on previous tests. 60 00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.649 sameeha siraj: I think like kind of broad would kind of help me more, maybe. 61 00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.920 Jenny Duan: Ok, cool right off the top of your head. What section would you say that you struggled the most on? 62 00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.250 sameeha siraj: I think. I think there was the 63 00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.610 sameeha siraj: English section. I mean the writing one. 64 00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.260 sameeha siraj: Okay, like the grammar section. Yes. 65 00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:59.719 Jenny Duan: okay, we'll just do. Sat grammar review. with my God, okay. 66 00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.169 Jenny Duan: So I just wanna walk you through like some general tips. This is kind of 67 00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:17.850 Jenny Duan: like, I'm just gonna flood your brain with some information, and then we'll do some practice problems at the end. So just first of all for questions, asking which sentence or sentence fragment fits best 68 00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:25.100 Jenny Duan: almost all the time, like the shorter one",
    " or the shortest one is the correct answer. Then 69 00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:33.770 Jenny Duan: anything that has a comet plus in it. She day is a common spice, which is wrong. So, for example. 70 00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.829 Jenny Duan: say like, okay. 71 00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.219 Jenny Duan: comma. She went to the store 72 00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:53.859 Jenny Duan: a lot of the times. They'll have situations like this, and that's almost always wrong. Okay, I think these 73 00:10:54.070 --> 00:11:06.819 Jenny Duan: these you can just read over in your own time. You have, I think, I shared with this document, but I'll share in the chat again. But let me just go over some other things from the beginning. I think these general tips don't really come up that often. But 74 00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.060 Jenny Duan: okay, we'll go over part of the speech first. So 75 00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.189 Jenny Duan: have you had formal grammar classes yet? 76 00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.759 sameeha siraj: I don't think so. 77 00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:28.799 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you know what type of question you normally miss on the grammar section that'll help me know what to go. Let me see. Like II think there's like one 78 00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.979 sameeha siraj: Let me like open the test that I took, and then see 79 00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.790 Jenny Duan: awesome. 80 00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.120 sameeha siraj: Sometimes it's like 81 00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:09.320 sameeha siraj: through like questions. You're like nevertheless, alternatively finally. 82 00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.440 sameeha siraj: sometimes those type of questions or 84 00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:25.310 sameeha siraj: oh, I think, like the most hard ones for me, are like the ones where you're supposed to like. Place the sentence like, where it's most logical. 85 00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:39.570 Jenny Duan: Okay? Got it. So let's first talk about commas and separating clauses. So these are your transitions, like t",
    "he additionally. Consequently, therefore, etc. So do you know what an independent, independent clause is 86 00:12:39.880 --> 00:13:00.549 Jenny Duan: okay. Awesome. Also. But tell me if you already know this stuff, because I'm just like going from the very, very basic. So most of the stuff you might already know. But I'm just gonna repeat it for redundancy. But just let me know if you like, already know this so there's 3 ways to separate 2 independent clauses, a period, a semicolon, and a comma plus a coordinated conjunction. 87 00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:11.289 Jenny Duan: so semicolon has the same usage as a period. So if you if you see a semicolon, it's basically like a period. So it separates 2 independent clauses. 88 00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.940 Jenny Duan: A comma 89 00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:25.349 Jenny Duan: is another way to connect different clauses. But if you have 2 independent clauses separated by a comma, that's a common spice, so you can't separate 2 independent clauses with a comma any time you see that happening that's just wrong. 90 00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.380 Jenny Duan: So 2 separate 2 commas can separate independent clause from an independent clause. 91 00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:40.380 Jenny Duan: However, they are not always separating a non essential clause, which means that an essential clause is basically the heart of a sentence. For example, if you say like 92 00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.980 Jenny Duan: therefore she went to the store. 93 00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.610 Jenny Duan: The part she went to the store would be the essential clause. 94 00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.840 Jenny Duan: And so here's the chart of when you should use a comma 95 00:13:51.540 --> 00:14:01.799 Jenny Duan: after name or title, always use a comma to separate a dependent clause from an independent clause, to separate a list, and after introductory words and phrases. 96 00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.660 Jenny Duan: so introductory words and phrases would be like first, second. 9",
    "7 00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.130 Jenny Duan: etc., like that. 98 00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:15.550 Jenny Duan: And no you. So you shouldn't use a comma after the word that before, after the word, that after the word, and between 2 independent clauses. 99 00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.750 Jenny Duan: before, after prepositions between adjectives and nouns. 100 00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:33.079 Jenny Duan: and then all these other things I think, are, too, in depth. I don't think you need to like explicitly memorize the rest. Okay? And then dashes and parentheses. Do you know these types of questions? Are you familiar with these? 101 00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:42.209 Jenny Duan: like, if it's like, okay, do you typically get typically, get these questions right or wrong? 102 00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:53.309 sameeha siraj: Usually right. Cause. I think like these kind of questions. It's like the ending of the sentence would either have like a comma or like a dash, and I'll be able to tell like, which one to use. 103 00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.950 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. And then 104 00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.939 Jenny Duan: transitions. So there's 3 types of transitions, continuous contradictions and cause and effect. 105 00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:14.279 Jenny Duan: So sometimes with transitions, what they're testing you for is how it connects to the rest of the, you know, piece or passage. So you need to identify what type of transition you're working with, and then decide what works best. 106 00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:27.290 Jenny Duan: So, for example, there's like continuers that add information that gives an example, defy, clarify, emphasize, compared also contradictors. So these are your alternatively, conversely. 107 00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:38.850 Jenny Duan: etc., and cause and effect. So when you have 2 sentences together, sometimes you need to identify what type of transition. It is said, not only whether it's grammatically correct, but whether it fits the situation 108 00:15:39.590 ",
    "--> 00:15:46.149 Jenny Duan: and then I think now that we've gone over this, let me run some practice problems. 109 00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.880 Jenny Duan: So 110 00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:54.419 Jenny Duan: you've done. Have you done all the Khan Academy tests like the SAT. Free practice test one through 10. 111 00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.430 sameeha siraj: No, I've been. I think I've been doing the ones on the college board site. 112 00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:06.339 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. I think those are the the same thing. So let me give you a test that you haven't done. 113 00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.979 Jenny Duan: and and how many of those have you done out of the tab? 114 00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.709 sameeha siraj: I think I've done like 6 of them. So let me. 115 00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.369 sameeha siraj: Yes, I did. 7, 8, 116 00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.429 sameeha siraj: the like. I think the fee that I didn't do were like 9, 117 00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.410 sameeha siraj: 5, one and 118 00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.620 sameeha siraj: 6, I think, yeah. 119 00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.210 Jenny Duan: okay, good. 120 00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.330 Jenny Duan: Let me find some other practice test. 121 00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.060 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna send you a link where? 122 00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.390 Jenny Duan: you can. 123 00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.090 Jenny Duan: You can find some more 124 00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.169 Jenny Duan: tests that you haven't taken yet. Give me a second. 125 00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:09.069 Jenny Duan: okay. 126 00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.579 Jenny Duan: can you see the chat 127 00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.500 sameeha siraj: slash my screen? Oh, yeah. 128 00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.540 Jenny Duan: Okay. So 129 00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.560 Jenny Duan: basically, here are 130 00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:36.379 Jenny Duan: It collected a database of some more sats that aren't released on the college board website. So, like April 2017, scho",
    "ol day, may 2017, etc. And then here are the answers, 131 00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.520 Jenny Duan: yeah. 132 00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.380 sameeha siraj: okay, 133 00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:48.790 Jenny Duan: so let's just look at like the more recent one may 21 us. And 134 00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.760 Jenny Duan: okay, just gonna download this. 135 00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.820 Okay? 136 00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:03.529 Jenny Duan: So it's okay. If you go to that link, it's a safe link like you're not gonna download a virus. Click it, 137 00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.329 Jenny Duan: and just go to the mid 2020 21. Us test. 138 00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.909 sameeha siraj: Yeah. Okay, I'm on it now 139 00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:17.249 Jenny Duan: and then scroll down to the grammar section. So that starts on page 17 of the Pdf. 140 00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.080 sameeha siraj: okay. 141 00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.329 Jenny Duan: okay, so I think I just wanna go through these like starting from the top 142 00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:38.399 sameeha siraj: sort of one by one. And on the grammar section. How many typically do you get wrong out of the 44? I mean, like, usually I do pretty well like I think I think 143 00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:46.730 sameeha siraj: like 3 to 4. II think it's not that well, but like 3 to 4 wrong. But this time I think I got like, 8 wrong. So 144 00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.710 Jenny Duan: okay, have no problem. Have you reviewed what you've gotten wrong so far already? 145 00:18:51.800 --> 00:19:03.159 sameeha siraj: Yeah, they're like, mostly, I think, like like most of them, were the sentence, like where to put them. And then, like there were like 3 which were because of 146 00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.929 sameeha siraj: the transition words. 147 00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:14.950 Jenny Duan: okay. So let me just pick out those types of questions, and we'll look at them. So for number one, this is a transition. So what's the correct answer? 148 00:19:16.130 --> 00:",
    "19:25.769 sameeha siraj: her number one? 149 00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.130 sameeha siraj: it would be d 150 00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.410 Jenny Duan: yep. And why is that? 151 00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.510 sameeha siraj: Because, like, you don't really need the. This means 152 00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.759 sameeha siraj: cause it's not a new sentence, and in which it means 153 00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.339 sameeha siraj: doesn't really make sense. And then and meaning cause you're not explaining anything before. So meaning would be the correct answer. 154 00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.530 Jenny Duan: Awesome. That's really good. 155 00:19:52.730 --> 00:20:15.720 Jenny Duan: And I think that with every SAT question you should have an explicit answer in your head as to why, that's the correct answer. So there shouldn't ever be ambiguity. Does that make sense? So you should always be able to explain to yourself like, why is something correct, or why something wrong? So if you feel like you're guessing, then try to come up with an answer at least to yourself, like why something is correct or why the other answers are wrong. 156 00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:40.649 Jenny Duan: Because I think a lot of the times people approach the grammar section sort of based on vibes. They're like, okay, this one feels right. So I'm just gonna choose it. But I think you should have an explanation for yourself, like basically what you just said to me was perfect like, answer, A is wrong, because this answer, B is wrong, because this answer D is correct, because this you should always be able to justify your answers. And if you go off of vibes, I would say like, try to come up with an answer, if you can. 157 00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.850 sameeha siraj: Okay? 158 00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.679 Jenny Duan: And then. 159 00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:58.129 Jenny Duan: okay, let's look at question 10. Add delete. Revise. The writer wants to add the following sentence to this paragraph. where is the best place",
    "ment for the sentence. 160 00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:04.149 Jenny Duan: and take your time with looking at this. Don't feel rushed. But once you're ready, let me know what the correct answer is. 161 00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.019 sameeha siraj: let's say after sentence, one. 162 00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's correct. Why. 163 00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:47.280 sameeha siraj: I think, cause it's kind of gives you like the foundation. So it says like they begin by, and then and the rest of us kind of expanding the rest of the project. 164 00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:57.219 sameeha siraj: or like the research and then the it won't be before the first one cause. That's kind of where they're introducing like what the research is. 165 00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.150 Jenny Duan: Got it? 166 00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:05.830 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And so what do you feel like is difficult about these types of questions, cause I feel like you got this one pretty immediately. 167 00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:26.539 sameeha siraj: I think not. It wouldn't be like necessarily, these type of questions. I think it'd be like like when it gives you like a sentence from the actual paragraph. And then it says like, where should it be moved cause. And then I think this one kind of makes more sense, because more like chronological. But sometimes in like. 168 00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.950 sameeha siraj: I'd say more 169 00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:39.099 sameeha siraj: fictional on text about that. That's when I kinda get confused cause they're kind of saying the same thing throughout, so you don't know like where to place it. 170 00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:40.610 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. 171 00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.400 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So what about this question? 11, this transition question. 172 00:22:48.030 --> 00:23:08.009 sameeha siraj: I'd probably say. 173 00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.319 sameeha siraj: okay, 174 00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.650 sameeha siraj: no change. 175 00:23:28.750 --> 00:",
    "23:29.970 Jenny Duan: I have. Why. 176 00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:46.599 sameeha siraj: I think. Okay. So it says, some plans propose moving threatened shallow water corals to deep waters. But this study suggests that. So it kind of like contradicts mid sentence 177 00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.990 sameeha siraj: like 178 00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:57.290 sameeha siraj: So the first sentence is kind of like the researchers hope that their findings can be used to improve quarrels. And then it kind of shows like 179 00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.989 sameeha siraj: how the plans 180 00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:14.860 sameeha siraj: I like that. And I kind of meanwhile, doesn't really make sense. Cause. It's not like happened. It's not like a time kind of thing, and as a result, would be kind of causes and effect. And conversely. 181 00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.849 sameeha siraj: I think that's kind of like 182 00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:27.650 sameeha siraj: it's like because of this, this happened, which is kind of the same as as a result. So I assume that like, for example, would be the best option. 183 00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:37.139 Jenny Duan: right? Because right here it says, the researchers hope that their findings can be used to improve coral conservation plans. And then, for example, 184 00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:44.149 Jenny Duan: right here. They're talking about the plans, and then they're illustrating a specific plan. So they're going more into detail about a specific plan that they talk about. 185 00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.640 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 186 00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:46.710 Jenny Duan: cool. 187 00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.140 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 188 00:24:51.240 --> 00:25:00.570 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think 13 is a good question to look at. At this point the writer wants to present argument that will be refuted. 189 00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.409 Jenny Duan: what do you think is the best answer. 190 00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.100 sameeha siraj: I say, C, 191 00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:",
    "33.139 Jenny Duan: correct. Yeah. Why? 192 00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:54.179 sameeha siraj: Because it says that it wants to be refuted in the next sent part of the sentence, and then I kind of read the beginning of the next part of the sentence, where it says, small businesses also stand to gain by going green. So I knew it had to be like despite, or although or while so, I kind of crossed out like the 193 00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.149 sameeha siraj: number, or like letter d and then 194 00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:08.499 sameeha siraj: I also saw that, like small businesses, large corporations, and also like kind of found, some one of the options which said that 195 00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:17.550 sameeha siraj: kind of like people think that small businesses wouldn't be able to gain. So yeah, I think C was the best option for that 196 00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.120 Jenny Duan: awesome 197 00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:34.819 Jenny Duan: awesome. That's correct. See the next one? okay. Hmm. 5, 15 is the transition one. 198 00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.199 Jenny Duan: What do you think is the correct answer. Oh, let's look at the end of the previous paragraph. 199 00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.540 Jenny Duan: Okay. 200 00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.539 Jenny Duan: alright. Now, let's look at this one. 201 00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.290 Jenny Duan: 15. 202 00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.720 sameeha siraj: Okay. 203 00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.160 sameeha siraj: can I see the end of the 204 00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.639 sameeha siraj: yeah, you can just look at it on your own. Pdf, as well. 205 00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.340 sameeha siraj: Okay. 206 00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.460 sameeha siraj: I'd say. 207 00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.010 sameeha siraj: d. 208 00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.350 Jenny Duan: yeah, that's correct. Why. 209 00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.560 sameeha siraj: this one is kind of like hard, which I don't have like a solid reasoning. 210 00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:07.709 sameeha siraj: But I'd say",
    ", like the other ones. The other options just kind of didn't make sense cause like the ending of the last paragraph kind of said 211 00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.649 sameeha siraj: like it would 212 00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:32.070 sameeha siraj: make employees wanna like apply. And that kind of like and see kind of con was like contradicting that by saying like, there's only 15 people and then the and letter B servicing motor homes as well as cars. It's kinda like off topic, and it doesn't really like relate to the last paragraph. 213 00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:38.660 sameeha siraj: and then the no change. I'd say like it just kinda introduces the shop rather than. 214 00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:39.920 sameeha siraj: and 215 00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:47.509 sameeha siraj: really likes adding anything. And then the DI think it doesn't, really. I won't say it's like that effective. But 216 00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:54.469 sameeha siraj: I feel like it's the most effective. So it was like one such business. A good transition. 217 00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:10.169 Jenny Duan: The reason why is exactly what you said in the previous paragraph, we talk about small businesses benefiting from renewable energy energy transitions on sort of a larger level right? And then we go into more specific about one such business. In this paragraph. 218 00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.730 Jenny Duan: So you're right. 219 00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.330 Jenny Duan: And now let's look. 220 00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:23.579 Jenny Duan: okay, let's look at 18. It's another transition. 221 00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.770 Jenny Duan: What's the correct answer here. 222 00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:37.130 sameeha siraj: I think it would be d 223 00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.440 Jenny Duan: correct. Why. 224 00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:52.180 sameeha siraj: I think, cause they already have the while so wouldn't be trans transcendentist, however or it doesn't really need another word, because it already says while. 225 00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.7",
    "20 sameeha siraj: and then comma 226 00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.350 Jenny Duan: awesome. 227 00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.640 Jenny Duan: correct, and then 21. 228 00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:10.439 Jenny Duan: I think this one is a good one. It's which choice provides a second example, as most similar to the one in the previous sentence. So I think it'd be easy to just look at this on your own screen. But yeah, 21. 229 00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.840 sameeha siraj: Let's say, d 230 00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.480 Jenny Duan: correct. Yeah. Why. 231 00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:50.719 sameeha siraj: it kind of like it relates to the last sentence, where it's talking about like how it's attracting people because of going green and then d kind of says the same thing, but with like statistical evidence. 232 00:30:51.460 --> 00:31:06.069 Jenny Duan: Correct? Okay. Now, we're gonna move on to question 25. I think this is pretty good. which choice most effectively establishes the main topic of the paragraph. Are you pretty comfortable with this type of question? 233 00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.370 sameeha siraj: I'd say I'm kind of bad at these kind of questions, so 234 00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.979 Jenny Duan: perfect. Then we'll we'll just review it. 235 00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:18.100 sameeha siraj: Okay? So if we haven't gotten anything wrong, though. I'm surprised. 236 00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:57.769 sameeha siraj: would it be? 237 00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.120 sameeha siraj: D 238 00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.659 Jenny Duan: yeah, correct. A lot of these have been D, actually, why. 239 00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.309 sameeha siraj: okay, so I kinda I quickly read the paragraph. And I saw like 240 00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:24.810 sameeha siraj: the main theme was kinda him just like researching about the place. I couldn't really understand anything else except for, like him, researching about the place and its social issues and stuff. And I think all the other ones kinda 241 00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:2",
    "8.310 sameeha siraj: topped about something else. 242 00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.919 sameeha siraj: And d was kind of like the one which is most on topic. 243 00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.120 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect. 244 00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:48.259 Jenny Duan: that sounds good, and I think another note I want to highlight. Is that with anything? You with anything on the SAT. You should not be feel 245 00:32:48.260 --> 00:33:13.230 Jenny Duan: like you're looking for a pattern in your answers like, I think this is something. When I was taking my sat I was like, Oh, like I got 3 C's in a row. The next one can't be a C or like I. You know I've got. I'm getting too many of the this one letter like, just don't worry about that. Just focus on whatever answers correct to you, because I've seen like real sats where they've had 4 of the same letter in the in a row. Or you know all these weird patterns like that. So 246 00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:21.979 Jenny Duan: just don't psych yourself out. If you know that something is correct. Just go with it, and don't look for answers in the scorecard, because that's just going to mess you up more. 247 00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.170 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 248 00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:39.349 sameeha siraj: cool. I feel like my main problem is like, when I'm actually taking the test. It feels like way worse, cause it's like timed and like you kind of try to rush through things, and you can't like calmly look at like each push, each like 249 00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:46.450 sameeha siraj: of the options. That's why, like a lot of these questions the ones with the longer answers, that's kind of where I mess up. 250 00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.249 Jenny Duan: Vasha. Do you run out of time when you take the SAT 251 00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:59.930 sameeha siraj: hmm! For some sections like I feel like I finish a right on the dot like for for this one writing 252 00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:08.150 sameeha siraj: I do get like. I think I have like 2 or 3 min rema",
    "ining when I'm done and then for reading like I have, like 253 00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:17.340 sameeha siraj: 10 ish minutes left, and like I can review all my answers and stuff. But this one is, I think it's like the harder one cause it's like so short 254 00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:47.759 Jenny Duan: got it. I think this week I want you to do an extra like an extra. Just grammar section. Don't do a full extra test, but just do one extra grammar session, and instead of setting a timer, I want you set a stopwatch. So when you start, start a stopwatch and take as much time as you need. Just don't worry about the time. Focus on accuracy, and at the end see how much time you really need because after that you can work on like cutting down if you need to. But I want you to take a test and see how much time you actually need and work with no time. Pressure like, take 255 00:34:47.760 --> 00:35:02.140 Jenny Duan: unlimited amount of time, but try to get as many accurate as you can. Does that make sense? And then you do one of these. So instead of doing one of the real ones or the ones on the college board website, just do like any one of these, 256 00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Instead. 257 00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:10.559 Jenny Duan: Okay. I think I wanna look at 31. It's another longer. One. 258 00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.689 sameeha siraj: Yeah. Okay. 259 00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:27.040 sameeha siraj: Would it be? B. 260 00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.660 Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry. I was muted. Yes, why 261 00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:51.639 sameeha siraj: so I'd say, like I kinda read the first few sentences, cause I think in the beginning, where I kind of messed up. I read like the sentence before, but from the beginning it says, like 262 00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:55.409 sameeha siraj: in the case of his designs for the museum 263 00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:07.220 sameeha siraj: research showing was the shape of the building. And then I saw that the first one was kind of like I was",
    " gonna do other A or B but a kind of says 264 00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:27.379 sameeha siraj: like, how African American communities like wanted a a museum for a really long time, and then for their identity, which doesn't really like, relate to the main paragraph, and then see it doesn't like. It's not part of the main purpose of the paragraph. 265 00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.900 sameeha siraj: And then 266 00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:43.440 sameeha siraj: D, it's like also doesn't really like reinforce the sentence that I just read. And CI think it's or I think B is like the most strong one, because it talks about the shapes of the head wear 267 00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.410 sameeha siraj: but that like he describes in the sentence earlier. 268 00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.870 Jenny Duan: right? Exactly 269 00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:59.580 Jenny Duan: and then there's one more question I want to get to, which is 22. And I think this is the type that you struggle the most with. Right? 270 00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:01.480 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah. 271 00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.930 Jenny Duan: okay. So why don't we do this one? 272 00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.429 sameeha siraj: Okay? 273 00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:16.029 Jenny Duan: these are kind of hard because you get when you read it the first time you're like, Oh, you get used to putting that sentence exactly where it is right and then be able to change it. 274 00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.579 Jenny Duan: You might need to look at the previous paragraph, if you need to. 275 00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.890 sameeha siraj: Okay. 276 00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.759 Jenny Duan: to just get like context. 277 00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:24.790 sameeha siraj: let's say 278 00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.690 sameeha siraj: after sentence, 2, 279 00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.570 Jenny Duan: yeah, correct. Why. 280 00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:39.009 sameeha siraj: okay, this one. I kind of. I was kinda confused about this one. But I decided with after symptoms, too, becaus",
    "e 281 00:39:39.380 --> 00:40:08.950 sameeha siraj: it kinda introduces like what she writes. So she's like. Once she describes her political exile, she writes, and then the rest, and then it doesn't really make sense right now, like where it is, because it. She kinda goes more into talking to like the or I guess these those sentences before like 3, and then 4 and 5, 3 and 4 and 6. It's kinda like after they introduce that she got exiled. 282 00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.610 sameeha siraj: so I think I think, after sentence 2 was like the most 283 00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:18.280 sameeha siraj: like cause sentence to also introduces, like what it is. So yeah. 284 00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.730 Jenny Duan: awesome. Sounds good. 285 00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.709 Jenny Duan: That's correct. Okay, I think 286 00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.199 Jenny Duan: you've actually got everything correct? 287 00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:37.450 Jenny Duan: so I feel like. I don't know. Do you feel like this? What do you feel like? You still feel the most confused about with this grammar section, or with grammar sections in general. 288 00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:45.730 sameeha siraj: Let me like, let me see if there's like any specific questions I had on the test. Okay. 289 00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:58.029 Jenny Duan: maybe it's just that matter of like overcoming the mental hurdle. I want you to take a test again this week and have no time pressure and see how you do cause. Maybe sometimes it is just that time pressure that affects you. 290 00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.510 sameeha siraj: yeah. 291 00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:25.469 Jenny Duan: because once we figure out, you know what the real issue is then we can solve it because sometimes you know. The real struggle for some students is that they just don't know the grammar concepts, or they just don't know how to do it. But for you I feel like, that's not the issue. I feel like your issue might be managing time management. And just like personal stress when ta",
    "king the test. Yeah, I agree. 292 00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:35.919 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I was also like of the same opinion. But and I was not sure, because I was not looking at her evaluation, and how she was actually, how critical was she in kind of scoring herself? 293 00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:43.290 Ivy Mentors: So might be a good idea of that would be like if you could actually share, you know the questions that you got wrong, and what how do you think about that? 294 00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:55.580 Ivy Mentors: And how are you like in general, like, you know? How are you kind of scoring it that kind of stuff because you said you got 1,400 yesterday? Right? So yeah, I mean, might be. 295 00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.260 Ivy Mentors: So yeah. 296 00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:18.689 Ivy Mentors: I think I, identifying the root cause is something that I would actually focus on as well, because I don't know where is the gap then? Because I'm actually quite happy that she is being able to answer rightly. And then, as you said Jenny might be, it's the time, constraint, and might be. Then the focus is like, how how does she really manage time and stress? And that kind of stuff? So 297 00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.309 Jenny Duan: right? Totally, yeah. 298 00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:37.080 Jenny Duan: And don't worry like this is a very normal thing to go through like everyone when they take SAT. It's always a struggle like, obviously you're not the only person who is struggling with whatever it may be, whether that's time management, or something different, like, it's a very normal circumstance. 299 00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.719 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what were you gonna say, though? 300 00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:47.729 sameeha siraj: I think. Is that okay? If we kind of go over the no calculator section now. So I feel like 301 00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:59.459 sameeha siraj: while writing was kinda hard for me, but I feel like I think that was mainly because of time. But some questions on like the math s",
    "ection check me up. So yeah. 302 00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:16.640 Jenny Duan: I would say, let's do our other another session this week and do the math section. I think 2 min is probably not enough to go through it thoroughly. But yeah, cause they're running a little bit low on time. But I think let's get either. Let's do our Tuesday session. 303 00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:29.629 Ivy Mentors: As another sat section, or we can schedule another session because we still have one to make up, cause, I think a couple of weeks ago we skipped one. Hey, Jenny, if you guys want like more time, I'm fine. With that I can sacrifice my time. That's fine. So I'll I'll let you decide. 304 00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:35.160 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, like 15 h, 15 min, or half an hour more. That's fine, too. Like I mean, it's up to you. 305 00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.130 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 306 00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:49.670 Jenny Duan: Then let's say, let's just keep going, because I don't wanna lose the momentum that we're working on and so would it be helpful for you to share your screen, and we'll talk about the questions that you get wrong? Or do you want to go over concepts? 307 00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.230 sameeha siraj: I think I'll share my screen. 308 00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. 309 00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:01.580 sameeha siraj: Okay. Actually, I think this one was with calculator. But I got like a lot of questions wrong on this one. 310 00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.069 sameeha siraj: okay, how many wrong would you say? 311 00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.539 sameeha siraj: Thank you. 312 00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:14.249 sameeha siraj: This was, I had 2 wrong on the with calculator, and then I had 313 00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.220 sameeha siraj: 1, 2, 2, 4, 314 00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:22.939 sameeha siraj: like 5, 5 ish wrong on the with calculator. So 315 00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.970 Jenny Duan: okay, got it. So let's just start from the first one. 316 00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:",
    "28.110 sameeha siraj: Okay, 317 00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.039 sameeha siraj: should I go for the ones with calculator or 318 00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.609 Jenny Duan: yeah, let's just do the ones with calculators, since it seems like 319 00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:45.179 Jenny Duan: you've got you've got more of those wrong. And then for the no calculator section, do you feel like you're getting questions wrong because you make silly mistakes, or because you don't understand the concept. 320 00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:52.020 sameeha siraj: There's some questions that I don't understand the concept like thank 321 00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.050 sameeha siraj: let me try to find Ashley. 322 00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:04.019 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, it's if there's any. No calculator that you don't understand the concept. Maybe we can do those first as well. 323 00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.080 sameeha siraj: Yes, 324 00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:11.210 sameeha siraj: I'm not sure how I got this one wrong, but I think. 325 00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.110 sameeha siraj: it was number 6. I thought I didn't. Guys. But 326 00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:25.919 Jenny Duan: okay, what's up? Okay, how did you do this? First? Tell me how you did this question. Okay? So first, 327 00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:32.600 sameeha siraj: okay. So first, I think I did 2 x minus 3 YI turn it to like 328 00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:40.470 sameeha siraj: 2 x is equal to 3 y minus 14 and then I did. X is equal to 329 00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.570 sameeha siraj: and 330 00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:51.270 sameeha siraj: negative 7 plus 3 over 2 y. And then I substituted that value of x into the other equation. 331 00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.899 sameeha siraj: And then I got the value of y. 332 00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.819 sameeha siraj: and then I substituted that back into this equation to get the value of X 333 00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:06.169 sameeha siraj: and then I got x minus YI don't know what I answered. I think it did. 334 00:46:06.600",
    " --> 00:46:12.209 sameeha siraj: and I answered a for some reason. 335 00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.939 Jenny Duan: Do you feel like you run out of time in the math sections. 336 00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:22.599 sameeha siraj: I think in the second, in the width calculator, when I ran out of time. 337 00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:35.409 Jenny Duan: Okay, no problem on the math section. The thing is, there's a lot of like hacks. To save time. So let me just share one of them with you right now. One of them is that you can completely 338 00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:38.730 Jenny Duan: subtract and add systems of equations. 339 00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:49.070 Jenny Duan: And usually when you do that, that saves a lot of time, and it also makes it more accurate. So whenever you see a question like this, where you're looking for a solution to the systems of equations. 340 00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.240 Jenny Duan: almost never are they asking you to substitute 341 00:46:52.330 --> 00:47:04.000 Jenny Duan: substitution is very easy to make mistakes with, and it takes a lot of time instead. Usually, what they're asking you to is directly manipulate the systems of equations. So in this case, 342 00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:09.240 Jenny Duan: so what would happen if you subtracted this equation from this equation? 343 00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:15.849 Jenny Duan: So take this whole equation and then subtract this equation. What do you get? 344 00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:20.370 sameeha siraj: you'd get 345 00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:25.070 sameeha siraj: negative x minus y. 346 00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.450 sameeha siraj: minus 347 00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.800 sameeha siraj: 8 348 00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.749 sameeha siraj: or equal to negative 8. 349 00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So you get I think 3 X minus 2 x is that should be positive. X, right? 350 00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:50.889 Jenny Duan: Oh, I guess you could substitute the top or the bottom. Yeah, it doesn't really matter if you subtr",
    "act the bottom button from the top one, you would get yeah, negative x. 351 00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.449 Jenny Duan: negative, 3 x minus negative, 2 y is minus y 352 00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.839 Jenny Duan: is equal to 353 00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.630 sameeha siraj: negative. 8, right? 354 00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.969 Jenny Duan: But what if you want the eggs to be positive, then you do like 355 00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.020 Jenny Duan: 8 minus y 356 00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.300 Jenny Duan: equals? X, right? 357 00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.450 Jenny Duan: And then, okay, actually, this doesn't tell us that much. 358 00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:21.600 Jenny Duan: let's see how else we can manipulate these 2 equations. 359 00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:25.549 Jenny Duan: what if you subtracted the 360 00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:31.250 Jenny Duan: the first one from the second one. Then you get hacks. Oh, plus y. 361 00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.410 Jenny Duan: and then negative, 6 equals 8. 362 00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.840 Jenny Duan: But now you want to get what x minus y is. 363 00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.940 Jenny Duan: actually, never mind, I think you're still mighty to subdue a systems of equations. 364 00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:58.360 Jenny Duan: So okay, let's, I'm just gonna start over and see how I would approach this question. So the first thing that I would do is actually I would check if you could subtract the 2 equations in this case. I don't think that you can, however. 365 00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:05.349 Jenny Duan: But sometimes you are just able to like exactly add or subtract the equations, and it gives you the correct answer. 366 00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:19.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, if that doesn't work, then I would say, the next thing I would try to do is to either get them under like the same denominator, and solve 367 00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:27.819 Jenny Duan: or do systems of equations like you said. But I think systems of equations is generally the last thing that you s",
    "hould do, because it takes a long time. 368 00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:40.419 Jenny Duan: so I would still try to manipulate the equations when solving them. And what I'm going to do is I'm gonna multiply this by 3. And I'm gonna multiply the second equation by 2 to cancel out the X's 369 00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.950 Jenny Duan: does that make sense what I'm doing right now? 370 00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:44.930 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 371 00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.400 Jenny Duan: because I'm trying to get y. So 372 00:49:48.520 --> 00:50:00.830 Jenny Duan: once I do that, I get 6 x minus 9 y equals negative. Think for 2, and then 6 x minus foury is equal to negative 12. 373 00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:02.209 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? 374 00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.420 sameeha siraj: Yes. 375 00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:11.620 Jenny Duan: Okay. And then I'm going to subtract the second equation from the first. So negative 9 y minus negative 4 y is what? 376 00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.770 sameeha siraj: Oh, sorry. What? 377 00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.970 Jenny Duan: So if I subtract the second equation from the first equation, what do I get? 378 00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:19.850 No 379 00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:29.079 sameeha siraj: You get negative 13 y. or is that? 380 00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:36.760 sameeha siraj: Oh, you'd get negative. 5 y is equal to 381 00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:42.129 sameeha siraj: 30, 30 negative 30. 382 00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.800 Jenny Duan: Right? Exactly. So y is equal to what? 383 00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:52.209 sameeha siraj: 30. And oh, not my bad. Y's equal to negative. 6, 384 00:50:52.400 --> 00:51:01.630 sameeha siraj: 6, 6. Okay, no problem. And then, after you do this, it should be pretty easy to solve for X, so you can get twox minus what? 385 00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.660 Jenny Duan: 3 minus 3 times y. 386 00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.750 sameeha siraj: oh, yeah, that would be 18 387 00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.789 Jenny Duan: equals negative 14. So 2 x is e",
    "qual to what? 388 00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:18.990 sameeha siraj: it would be. 389 00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.149 sameeha siraj: Okay. I'm just like it's not loading on my screens. 390 00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.540 Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry. 391 00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.010 sameeha siraj: Okay, it would be 392 00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:33.890 sameeha siraj: 2 x is equal to 4, and then x is equal to 2. 393 00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:38.260 Jenny Duan: So what is x minus y. 394 00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:44.219 sameeha siraj: negative 4. 395 00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:48.490 Jenny Duan: Exactly perfect. So I don't know. 396 00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:54.979 Jenny Duan: yeah, when you went to when you did it with systems of equations. Where do you think you made the mistake? 397 00:51:55.990 --> 00:52:17.819 sameeha siraj: I think like substituting is kind of like a long process. And I might have like, probably when I got the answer of like what y is equal to. I probably substituted into like the wrong equation, or like the wrong. Yeah, the wrong equation, like, for example, I probably like substituted it into like a 398 00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:26.629 sameeha siraj: like when y is equal to this value, I probably substituted the x in for like the wrong thing. So yeah. 399 00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:43.919 Jenny Duan: awesome. Yeah, I think doing this where you're manipulating the systems of equations directly, and you're trying to like, get rid of some of the variables is a lot faster. Then, if you just try to solve for each of the variables directly with fractions like, try to avoid fractions in all cases. 400 00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:57.939 Jenny Duan: And this is the strategy that you can use like either, subtracting the equations directly, and if you're not able to do that, then like, try to get them under a common constant, and then, like subtracting either the X values or the Y values. Should be easier. 401 00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:11.409 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? That's the strategy that y",
    "ou can kind of have in the back of your head. But did you want to go to the next question? Now, is there another? No calculator question that you didn't understand? Or should we go straight to the calculator section? 402 00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:17.260 sameeha siraj: Let me just see if Number 10 like, why he got it wrong and check. 403 00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.279 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah, I think this one? II don't really know how to do it. 404 00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.139 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 405 00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:27.889 Jenny Duan: Okay. So what does it mean for a system of equations to have no solution. 406 00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:35.120 sameeha siraj: For them not to like equal each other, maybe or 407 00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.870 sameeha siraj: I'm not sure. 408 00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.839 Jenny Duan: Yes. So for 2 lines. What does it mean for them to 409 00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:48.560 Jenny Duan: have no solution, cause assistance of equations. It's just equations for 2 lines, right? 410 00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:52.309 sameeha siraj: I guess. For them not to have like a point of intersection. 411 00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.659 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and what does that look like? 412 00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:57.259 sameeha siraj: Do you have an Internet airline? 413 00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:58.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah, they're parallel. 414 00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.349 Jenny Duan: And so in this case, what it would, it mean for this equation to have no solution. 415 00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:11.710 sameeha siraj: I think, the value of K would have to 416 00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:16.889 sameeha siraj: be the same as a value of like the slope. Maybe. 417 00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So when the 418 00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:31.640 Jenny Duan: yeah. So you want the x's to be the same. But you want the. So you want the equations to be the same, but equal different constants. Does that make sense? 419 00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:33.230 sameeha siraj: Okay, ",
    "yeah. 420 00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:39.720 Jenny Duan: So we're gonna do what we did in the last in the last problem. And we're going to 421 00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:52.989 Jenny Duan: get them under. We're gonna get the Y values to be the same. And if the Y values are the same, then we can make the X values the same that way that they're they're the same equation. But equally different constants. 422 00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000 Jenny Duan: Does that process make sense? Or is that in and of itself confusing? 423 00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:02.280 sameeha siraj: Oh, so you're gonna like, multiply 4 by a number to make it 7. 424 00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:12.820 Jenny Duan: Not quite. Because we're looking for K, so we're trying to get K to be equal to whatever this 4 is equal to in the end. 425 00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:25.099 Jenny Duan: So let me just walk you through it. And then maybe that'll be helpful. So we're gonna multiply this equation by 3. And this equation by 5, because we want to get the Y values the same. Does that make sense? 426 00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.899 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 427 00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:30.629 Jenny Duan: So what would happen to the first equation if we multiplied by 5, 428 00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:43.229 sameeha siraj: leave 5 KX minus 15 y is equal to 20. Yeah, perfect. And then what about a second? When you multiply by 3 12 x minus 15 y is equal to 429 00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.390 sameeha siraj: 21. 430 00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:51.520 Jenny Duan: So now that the y's are the same, we just want to make sure that the X's are the same. So we want 5 k. To equal 12. Does that make sense? 431 00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:52.630 sameeha siraj: Yes. 432 00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:54.719 Jenny Duan: So what's K? 433 00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.890 sameeha siraj: It would be 434 00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.620 sameeha siraj: 12 over 5 435 00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:17.389 Jenny Duan: perfect, because we, what we wanted is we wanted the same equation, but equaling different c",
    "onstants. Because, if we remember, if we draw on, you know a coordinate axis, then the constants are the parts where it intersects with the y-axis, right? 436 00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.480 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 437 00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:22.870 Jenny Duan: So if we if we have the same line, but 438 00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:27.159 Jenny Duan: I cannot draw a straight line. We have the same 439 00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:37.849 Jenny Duan: if we have the same coordinate plane. But let's just say that the lines intersect on different parts of the axis, then you know that they're going to be parallel, right? 440 00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:45.330 sameeha siraj: and that means that they have no solution. Does that make sense or is that confusing yeah, that makes sense no. 441 00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:52.649 Jenny Duan: cool okay, i'm gonna give you an example problem. Let's wait. Stay on this question. 442 00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.730 Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna write you another problem. And I want you to solve it. 443 00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:59.030 sameeha siraj: Is that? Okay? Yeah. 444 00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:11.910 Jenny Duan: okay, so let's say, 5 x minus 20. Y is equal to 7 is equal to 3, and then 445 00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:24.070 Jenny Duan: 3 x plus KY is equal to 4. For what value of k, will the system of equations have no solution? 446 00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:25.510 Jenny Duan: We solve this? 447 00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:34.830 sameeha siraj: I can't see the equation on my okay, I don't see it. Okay. 448 00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:43.880 Jenny Duan: and feel free to. Yeah. 449 00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:55.889 Jenny Duan: I said, feel free to just like, write on the screen right on paper. Through it. Whatever you feel most comfortable with, you can do it on paper, too, if you need to. I think I'll do on screen. So then 450 00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.370 sameeha siraj: and 452 00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:15.960 Jenny Duan: not quite 453 00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.370 Jenny Duan: they're really ",
    "close. 454 00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.590 sameeha siraj: I think, i'm doing like this step wrong over here. 455 00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:33.189 Jenny Duan: Yup, so you don't need to worry about what the constants are the constants like at the end 9 and 20, you can forget you're just trying to solve for K. And how are you going to do that? 456 00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.340 sameeha siraj: So we subtract this bottom one? 457 00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.600 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to do any subtraction. Is there another way? You can do it. 458 00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:49.740 sameeha siraj: Oh, with 459 00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:51.740 sameeha siraj: we'd set them equal. 460 00:59:52.440 --> 01:00:07.100 sameeha siraj: Yeah, exactly. Forget about that. But you don't need to look at the 20 and the 9. Those are irrelevant. Now at this point, so negative 60 y would equal to 5. Ky, okay, yeah. Perfect. And then k is equal to 12 461 01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:10.030 Jenny Duan: and is cable the 12. 462 01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.659 sameeha siraj: Oh, negative. 12. 463 01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:16.780 Jenny Duan: Perfect. Yeah, okay, does that make sense on how you just solve that question? 464 01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.220 sameeha siraj: Yeah, I think I think I got tripped up over here like 465 01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.050 sameeha siraj: I didn't know they could equal each other. So yeah. 466 01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:40.030 Jenny Duan: awesome. Yeah. Because when you're looking for having no solution, then, like whatever, it equals whatever's on the right side of the equation doesn't matter, because all you want to do is have the left side be the same, and then the right side, you want them to be different, because those are the different 467 01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:51.640 Jenny Duan: because on the line, if you imagine it on a coordinate plane, the 2 lines have to intersect have to intersect the Y axis at 2 different points. So that's why you don't want to set the things on the righ",
    "t side to be the same thing as well. 468 01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:57.860 Jenny Duan: because if they were the same thing the lines would be parallel. I mean, the lines would be the same line, and they would have infinite solutions. 469 01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.030 sameeha siraj: Okay. okay, okay. 470 01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:08.770 Jenny Duan: Now, let's do the calculator section. Are there like a couple of specific questions that you feel like were the most challenging. 471 01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:11.570 sameeha siraj: Okay? Yeah. 472 01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.179 sameeha siraj: I think there was one of the 473 01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:25.159 sameeha siraj: only there was one question on like the the bubble end, one which I just like didn't get at all. 474 01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.309 sameeha siraj: We find it. 475 01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:39.429 sameeha siraj: I think it's always a system of equations and of inequalities with this one. I didn't really understand how to do it. 476 01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:50.770 Jenny Duan: Ok, let's go over it in the XY plane. If I point with coordinates, A B lies in the solution set of the system of equations above, what is the maximum possible value of? B, 477 01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:52.180 Jenny Duan: okay. 478 01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:58.350 Jenny Duan: so let's just graph this and see what? Oh, I think. 479 01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:09.389 sameeha siraj: Okay, are you familiar with graphing on your graphing calculator? What? That's a good calculator. Do you know how to graph on it? 480 01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.840 sameeha siraj: No. 481 01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:29.719 Jenny Duan: okay, that's your mission for this week. I want you to look up on Youtube, a graphing tutorial, how to graph equations, how to graph in qualities, how to graph circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas on your calculator. I'm gonna write that down in your document just so you can remember 482 01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.910 Jenny Duan: how to grab 483 01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:3",
    "8.940 Jenny Duan: and 484 01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:46.639 Jenny Duan: systems of equations, inequalities, circles, ellipses, hyperbolas. 485 01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:54.589 Jenny Duan: and that should be it because your calculator will be very helpful in helping you find solutions in other things. 486 01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:07.719 Jenny Duan: So in the Xy plane point with coordinates ab licens in the solution set of the systems of A Co system of inequalities above, what is the maximum possible value of B. So let's just like we can graph this on paper kind of 487 01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.980 Jenny Duan: to see what it looks like. So 488 01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.289 Jenny Duan: you know that this, let's just say, this is like 3,000. 489 01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:23.020 Jenny Duan: it has a negative slope. Right? So what does that line look like? Kinda like something like that? Right? 490 01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:24.510 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 491 01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:31.800 Jenny Duan: And then y is greater than or equal to 5 x. Where is the Where does intersect the y axes? 492 01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:38.870 sameeha siraj: at 3,000? 493 01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:42.900 sameeha siraj: No, for the second equation. Oh, 494 01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.420 sameeha siraj: at the 0. 495 01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.779 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect. So this is, gonna look something like 496 01:03:53.030 --> 01:04:03.989 Jenny Duan: this, the slope is not as steep as the first one, but just like, excuse my bad drawing skills. So it's gonna yeah, it's gonna look something like like, Oh, my, gosh, that's 497 01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:16.789 Jenny Duan: if this were actually just pretend like, this is at the origin. Okay, you get the idea. So where? What are you trying to find? You're trying to find the maximum possible value of B, 498 01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.490 Jenny Duan: so let's see. 499 01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:22.860 Jenny Duan: negative 15 x plus 2,000 500 01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.580 Jenny Du",
    "an: in the solution set. So less than 501 01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:34.929 Jenny Duan: So you're looking for stuff that's less than this, right? So I'm just gonna shade in here. It's less than the first equation, right? Does that make sense? 502 01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.610 sameeha siraj: Yeah? 503 01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:42.070 Jenny Duan: And then the second equation, you're looking for less than this. So it's gonna be this area right? 504 01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:49.389 Jenny Duan: And just looking at this graph, what is the maximum value of B like? Where is it on the graph? Can you point to it. 505 01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.979 sameeha siraj: Would it be over here? 506 01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:56.259 Jenny Duan: Yes, and this is also the point of intersection. Right? 507 01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.760 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 508 01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:22.809 Jenny Duan: So all you have to do is if you were to solve this with equations, you can just say, like, where does negative 15 x plus 3,000 equal 5 x. That's another way to solve that. Or once you've graphed these 2 in your graphing calculator, there's actually a feature to just find, like the point of intersection like you should just be a button where you can just press, find point of intersection. And that's something that you should look into this weekend while you're researching how to use your graphing calculator. 509 01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:31.359 Jenny Duan: So I mean, either way is is fine, like solving. This is not to not to time intensive. You just see 20 x is equal to 3,000. 510 01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:38.749 Jenny Duan: So you do. X is equal to, and then you can use your calculator to do 3,000 divided by 20 which should be 511 01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:45.639 Jenny Duan: I think something like 1,500, but 512 01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:50.299 Jenny Duan: I mean 1 50 and negative 1 50. Sorry. 513 01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.690 Jenny Duan: actually wait. No. 514 01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.159 Jenny Duan: pause. Her 1 50,",
    " I think that's the answer. But you can verify this. 515 01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:01.310 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 516 01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:06.330 Jenny Duan: So that would be, how you solve this type of question, does that make sense? 517 01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:07.440 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 518 01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:12.290 Jenny Duan: okay, are there any questions that you have? Like burning questions about? 519 01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:30.559 sameeha siraj: yeah, this one is kind of like confusing. No. 2025. 520 01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:38.579 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Geometry. Okay. what is closest to the volume of the grain silo. So just looking at this question, how did you try to approach it? 521 01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:47.590 sameeha siraj: So first, like, I kinda went back to like where it gives you the formulas over 522 01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:51.450 sameeha siraj: in the beginning. I'm gonna use this one hmm 523 01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:58.609 sameeha siraj: to find like the cylinder. And then, like the cone and this one 524 01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:00.460 sameeha siraj: so 525 01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:07.550 sameeha siraj: wait. I don't know. Wait! I'm confused, cause I feel like I don't remember doing this question. I don't 526 01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.729 sameeha siraj: think it looks confusing, but I don't 527 01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:12.020 sameeha siraj: remember. 528 01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:15.740 sameeha siraj: I don't think this is the right test, actually. 529 01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:21.899 sameeha siraj: Oh. wait. isn't it? 530 01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.649 sameeha siraj: Oh, my God! It was it was another one. 531 01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:34.369 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's look at the other test. 532 01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:53.660 sameeha siraj: Then what about that? Systems of equations? Question, how did you remember that one? I looked at my answer she and I think that's the one that I think that's the the I think the other section. I don't know. I remember doing those, b",
    "ut I don't know why II don't remember any of those any of those questions. 533 01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.139 sameeha siraj: yeah. 534 01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.710 sameeha siraj: 20 535 01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.410 sameeha siraj: 7, I think. Wait. 536 01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:04.170 Jenny Duan: So which test did you do? If it wasn't this one? 537 01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:16.160 Jenny Duan: It was it was this one, the wait. Am I sharing it right now? I think it's under the practice of 3 steam. I have to unshare and then reshare. Okay, this is 538 01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.780 sameeha siraj: okay. 539 01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.460 Jenny Duan: so 27, you said. 540 01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:27.740 Jenny Duan: Okay, oh, these are pretty common question types. Okay, it's good that we do this. So 541 01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:32.249 Jenny Duan: okay, the world's population has grown an average rate of 1.9%. 542 01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:47.330 Jenny Duan: There were approximately 4 billion people in 1,975. And then what are the functions? Represents? Which of the functions represents the world's population? P. And billions to years since 1975. 543 01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.290 Jenny Duan: How did you approach this question? 544 01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:55.329 sameeha siraj: So I knew that. Like, since it's like a 19% 545 01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:59.870 sameeha siraj: increase. It wouldn't be like 1.9 or 1.1 9, or like 546 01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:12.450 sameeha siraj: a 1.9% increase, so it wouldn't be 1.9 or 1.19. So it had to be a or DI think II said, D, but I think 547 01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:25.749 sameeha siraj: now that I think on it. It doesn't really make sense. Cause do you use kinda like it initially starts. And this is how much it goes per year. But I don't. That's not accurate, cause it's like percent of 4 billion. 548 01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:35.140 sameeha siraj: So I see where this stuff but like, if there's like more questions like this, I kinda wanna know how to do them. 549 0",
    "1:09:35.479 --> 01:09:43.160 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so population rate, all of these, they're gonna be exponent questions. And with exponent questions, because 550 01:09:43.160 --> 01:10:06.309 Jenny Duan: everything every year you're building off of what you had the previous year. Right? So when they say 1.9 per year since 1945, they're not adding a fixed number of people every year. So the answer is not going to be a linear equation, because it's not like every year, you know, like 20 babies are born or whatever it's, you know, a certain percentage of what was last year. So it's gonna be continuously increasing. And if you think about what the 2 graphs look like 551 01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.110 Jenny Duan: the graph is gonna look more like that. 552 01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:22.080 Jenny Duan: Cause. If every year you know a certain number of things increase, then you know, compounds year every year versus just a linear increase like this. This is the same concept. Have you heard about the book? Atomic habits? 553 01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:24.320 sameeha siraj: Yeah, I've heard of it. 554 01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:29.049 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So you know how atomic and atomic habits they see like a 1% increase 555 01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:41.660 Jenny Duan: leads to like a huge amount of improvement over time, right? And that's of like compound interest. And the same thing here, because it's compounded. And it's not like a fixed increase every year. So that's why you need to do 556 01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:47.920 Jenny Duan: this exponent. And you're right in eliminating. Be like, that's definitely wrong. C is definitely wrong. 557 01:10:48.290 --> 01:11:03.840 Jenny Duan: and the constant is usually whatever you start with, because if you think about when t is 0, when t is 0, when an exponent is 0, then that's one right. For example, like any constant A to the 0 is just one. Does that make sense? Yeah? 558 01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:09.549 Jenny Duan: So at the start, in 1975, the popula",
    "tion is 4 billion right? 559 01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:23.499 Jenny Duan: And so every single year after that you're multiplying it by 1.0 1 9. So you're adding 19 of what they had the previous year? To the following year. Does that make sense? Yeah. 560 01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:29.440 Jenny Duan: so does this type of question make sense to you? Or are there any other aspects of it that are confusing. 561 01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.810 sameeha siraj: I think this kind of makes sense to me now 562 01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:49.379 sameeha siraj: cool. I just realized the last practices. I think that's probably because that was one of the ones that I was taking like throughout the week, just to different sections. And I didn't get to mess Nope with calculator yet. But I think 563 01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:57.710 sameeha siraj: I'll try to find the one which it was like, it was also a volume, question, but I didn't understand it. And then 564 01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.090 sameeha siraj: also. 565 01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:04.869 sameeha siraj: I think the 30 sixth one on this one is not so confusing for me this one 566 01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:15.420 Jenny Duan: alright cool. 36. Let's go for that in the figure above. Tan B, so are you familiar with trigonometry like sign Cosign tangent. 567 01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.350 Jenny Duan: Okay? So what does tangent stand for? 568 01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:22.810 sameeha siraj: opposite, over adjacent. 569 01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:32.520 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I think it's adjacent. But I think pronunciation obviously doesn't really matter. It's math. 10 B equals 3 over 4. So what's the opposite 570 01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.169 sameeha siraj: opposite of tan. 571 01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:41.830 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, like what would be the opposite for B, so like what side would be like? 3. 572 01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.269 sameeha siraj: Oh, it would be DE, 573 01:12:45.990 --> 01:13:01.590 Jenny Duan: yeah, so 3. And adjacent is this one? Right? So 3,",
    " 4. So this type of triangle is called a 3, 4, 5 triangle and this is just a ratio that you would need to know and memorize, so be in this case would be 5. 574 01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.190 Jenny Duan: Are you familiar with the different, like common types of triangles. 575 01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:16.410 sameeha siraj: I know about the at the 30 60, 91, and then I know there's like the 90 45 and 45. But I've never heard of. Like the 3, 4, 5, one. 576 01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:24.970 Jenny Duan: Okay, just commit this one to memory. It's another type of right triangle. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 9, 1215. All the same thing. 577 01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:35.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. BC, equals 15. And okay. So if you know that BC equals 15 and D 578 01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.809 Jenny Duan: a equals 4. 579 01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.449 Jenny Duan: Then what is the length of DE. 580 01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.730 Jenny Duan: So another thing the engines know is 581 01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.719 Jenny Duan: BDE is similar to BAC. 582 01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:57.020 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense. Why, okay? So the ratios of the lanes are going to be the same. 583 01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:59.240 Jenny Duan: Okay. 584 01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.050 Jenny Duan: okay. PI see. So if you know that be 585 01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:18.050 Jenny Duan: BC is 15, and DA is 4, because these ratios are like a 3, 4, 5 like this triangle BAC also has a 3, 4, 5 ratio. 586 01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:20.340 Jenny Duan: in its silence. Does that make sense? Why? 587 01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:21.580 sameeha siraj: Yeah. 588 01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:27.790 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Because tan of B also corresponds to the ratio. 589 01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:36.840 Jenny Duan: between Ca, and BA. In this case, tan B, 3 or 4 could also mean that. Ca is 3, and BA is 4. Does that make sense? 590 01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.090 sameeha siraj: So they'd be equal. 591 01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:44.240 sameeha siraj: No, they're not equal. The rati",
    "os are equal. 592 01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:58.409 Jenny Duan: So it's not like DE and H and Ca are equal, but it's more like the ratios between them are equal. For example, if this were a 3, 4, 5 triangle, if BED. Were like a 3, 4, 5 triangle. Then BCA, could be a. 593 01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:04.839 Jenny Duan: let's say, 6, 8, 10, triangle where the ratios between the sides are the same. Does that make sense? Yes. 594 01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:13.600 Jenny Duan: okay. And so that's all we need to notice, because these are 2 right triangles, 2 similar right triangles. And how do we know that they're similar? 595 01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:17.360 sameeha siraj: Because they have their same angles 596 01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:26.960 Jenny Duan: exactly exactly perfect. So the BC is 15, and you know that this is a 3, 4, 5 triangle. Then what is the length of BA, 597 01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.240 sameeha siraj: it will be 8 598 01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.079 Jenny Duan: exactly. Wait, actually. 599 01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.570 Jenny Duan: can you explain why it's 8? 600 01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.250 sameeha siraj: Bd is 4, and DA is 4, so I kind of combine them. I saw a skate. 601 01:15:45.640 --> 01:16:07.689 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, no, BD is not actually 4 this. This 3, 4, 5 doesn't refer to the actual sidelines. It refers to the ratio between the sidelines. So right now we still don't know what BD is. Just you can ignore this we don't know. We only know this as the ratio. We don't know what the actual length of BD is, but now we need to know what BA is given that you know. BA. 602 01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:16.489 Jenny Duan: It has a ratio of 4, and BC. Has a ratio of 5, so like the ratio between these 2 sides is 5 is 4 to 5. So 603 01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.299 Jenny Duan: x to 15 is also 4 to 5. 604 01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.509 sameeha siraj: Does that make sense? Yeah. 605 01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:23.500 Jenny Duan: And so what's x? 606 01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:28.450 sameeha siraj: So",
    " that would be 12, 607 01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:34.179 Jenny Duan: yeah. 12. So what's now? What's the length? If BA is 12, what's the length of BD 608 01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:38.370 sameeha siraj: It would be 8. 609 01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:46.590 Jenny Duan: Exactly. So. BD is 8, and now we know that you know be 610 01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:52.360 Jenny Duan: Now we know that, you know Tan B is 3 to 4 right 611 01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:54.569 Jenny Duan: again. We're bringing it back to this. 612 01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.550 Jenny Duan: you know that. So we know that 613 01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.900 Jenny Duan: 3, 2 DE, so I'm just gonna call 614 01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:08.660 Jenny Duan: GEX is the same thing as 4 to 8. Does that make sense? 615 01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:22.040 Jenny Duan: b is opposite right DE is what we have here has the ratio of 3, and then BD has the ratio of 8. But it's also like the the 4 side in terms of the ratios. 616 01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.250 sameeha siraj: Okay, yeah. 617 01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:25.209 Jenny Duan: So what's X? 618 01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:28.840 sameeha siraj: it will be. 619 01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.210 sameeha siraj: Wait. Does X represent A to C or a C 620 01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:39.589 Jenny Duan: X represents DE, sorry. 621 01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.730 sameeha siraj: Okay, 622 01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:50.559 sameeha siraj: Oh, I'm kind of confused like, what does that 3 stand for? Then? Like, yeah, 3. Is this ratio? 623 01:17:50.760 --> 01:18:14.540 Jenny Duan: because de and Bd have a 3 to 4 ratio. So 3 to 3 is the length of X, and since we already solve the length of BD. Right, we know that this side, with the 4 ratio has a length of 8, and we know that since it's a 3, 4, 5 triangle, if we know the ratios, we can use the ratios to get the side length, so if they're side with ratio, 4 has the length of 8, then decided 624 01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:16.939 Jenny Duan: with ratio 3 has a length of what? 625 01:18:18.300 --> 01:1",
    "8:22.800 sameeha siraj: Oh, 6. 626 01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:25.700 Jenny Duan: Exactly. So. The length of DE is 6. 627 01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:37.119 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? Okay, actually, that might be a bit confusing. Now, I want you to find. So now that we've I've walked you through how to find the length of de based on what we know. What's the length of A/C 628 01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.140 sameeha siraj: it would be 629 01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:47.759 sameeha siraj: 3. Oh, not 3. Sorry. It has a ratio of 3. But what's the length? 630 01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:52.019 sameeha siraj: it'll be 12. 631 01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.070 Jenny Duan: We know that BA has leave. 12, right? 632 01:18:57.670 --> 01:18:58.609 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah. 633 01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:10.550 sameeha siraj: Oh, okay. So it would be. 634 01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:11.970 sameeha siraj: And 635 01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.040 sameeha siraj: 18. 636 01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:17.060 Jenny Duan: Why? 637 01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.570 sameeha siraj: Because if 638 01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:29.690 sameeha siraj: wait, so de is 6 then 6 to 6 times 3 is 18. 639 01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:38.060 sameeha siraj: wait, why are you multiplying it by 3? Okay. 640 01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:40.260 sameeha siraj: I'm kind of confused cause. There's like. 641 01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.600 sameeha siraj: like a lot of ratios, cause for no, there's like 4 to 5, and then there's like 4 to 8. 642 01:19:46.840 --> 01:20:07.350 sameeha siraj: And then, okay, let's just ignore. Let's ignore the little triangle. So if you know that these this is a 3, 4, 5, triangle right? Which means that in the in terms of ratios. Ca, it has ratio. 3 BA has ratio 4, and BC has ratio 5. Does that make sense? 643 01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:09.800 Jenny Duan: 9. Right? Perfect? 644 01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:19.090 Jenny Duan: Okay, I really wanna make sure that you get this concept down. So now I'm gonna clear the whole screen. And I want you to explain ",
    "how to solve for the length of 645 01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:24.909 Jenny Duan: BE. And I want you to walk me through that process. How do we solve for BE, 646 01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:30.010 sameeha siraj: which is this? Link VE, okay. 647 01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:36.009 sameeha siraj: so 10 B is equal to 3 over 4. So 648 01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:40.949 sameeha siraj: 3, and work and then 649 01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.959 sameeha siraj: BC, we know is 650 01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:48.920 sameeha siraj: like entirely 15 651 01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:53.309 sameeha siraj: and then DA is 4, 652 01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:07.640 sameeha siraj: so do the do that 3, 4, 5 ratio. We know that this is going to be like the ratio of 5 653 01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.910 sameeha siraj: perfect. And so now 654 01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.090 sameeha siraj: we should to find like this total thing. 655 01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:20.460 sameeha siraj: it would be a. 656 01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:25.110 sameeha siraj: So, this would be 3, 4 and the left that's a 5, 657 01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:30.120 sameeha siraj: so i guess 3, times 5 is 658 01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:38.910 sameeha siraj: 13. So like 3 would be your think they were multiplying this ratio by so 659 01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:42.119 sameeha siraj: 3 times 4 is 12. 660 01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:46.510 sameeha siraj: And so that's our length of 661 01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:54.790 sameeha siraj: Oh, oops. Okay. So 3 times. What is 15? And it's 5, 662 01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.130 Jenny Duan: right? 663 01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.990 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 664 01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:03.149 Jenny Duan: And then what's what's after that? 665 01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:05.470 sameeha siraj: Oh, okay, to find the other ones. 666 01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:07.240 Jenny Duan: You're looking for the 667 01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:10.279 Jenny Duan: the length of be 668 01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.230 sameeha siraj: right? And so, yeah. 669 01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:15.429 Jenny Duan: so ho",
    "w did you get 5 as the answer there? 670 01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.570 sameeha siraj: Because the ratio 671 01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:30.939 sameeha siraj: since, like we know that this triangle is a 3, 4, 5, and then we know that this, like entire side, this entire side is 15, 672 01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:32.620 sameeha siraj: so I'll be like 673 01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:36.749 sameeha siraj: 15 to 5, 674 01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:44.500 sameeha siraj: x to 4, 675 01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.050 sameeha siraj: and then 676 01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:53.220 sameeha siraj: I'm gonna call this like y 2, 3. 677 01:22:53.550 --> 01:23:00.760 Jenny Duan: But you're talking. Then you're talking about the big triangle you're talking about? BAC, but I'm asking you about the length of BE, the little one. 678 01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 679 01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:09.579 sameeha siraj: Yeah, so like. So 5 like, we don't know 5, right? But we know that this is like the 5 of the 680 01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.340 sameeha siraj: 3, 4, 5 681 01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.520 sameeha siraj: ratio. 682 01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.110 sameeha siraj: So 683 01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:20.940 sameeha siraj: we have to like, consider that this, like big one, is similar to the other triangle. 684 01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:22.090 sameeha siraj: Yeah. Yeah. 685 01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.810 sameeha siraj: And we see that that's like the 5 of the bigger triangle. Right? 686 01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.650 sameeha siraj: And the relation is that 15 687 01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:34.169 sameeha siraj: divided by 3, is going to be 688 01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:41.860 sameeha siraj: the reason i'm doing 3, dividing it by 3 is cause if it has to be 15 689 01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:47.730 sameeha siraj: and it's gonna be the 5, then you can only divide 3 to get 5, 690 01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.450 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah. so what does that tell you about the rest of the triangle? 691 01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:59.080 samee",
    "ha siraj: it tells me, like about the other sides. 692 01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:04.589 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. And so how are you going to use that to get the length of the small one. 693 01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:11.779 sameeha siraj: is this not? I'm kind of confused like, would this be considered? The side like 694 01:24:12.570 --> 01:24:14.860 sameeha siraj: is 5. Correct? 695 01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:16.010 Jenny Duan: No. 696 01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:26.089 Jenny Duan: because 5 is just the ratio, it's not the side length. So whenever you're writing like 3, 4, 5, the length is not actually 5. That's just the ratio between the sides. 697 01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:30.440 Jenny Duan: Maybe it would be helpful if we wrote like 3 x 4 x 5 x 698 01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.199 sameeha siraj: huh? Right here. 699 01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:45.639 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because, yeah, II wanna emphasize that like the 3, 4, 5 is not the actual sidelines. It's the ratio. So yeah, maybe 3 x 4 x 5 x would be like a a more useful way to write. That? 700 01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:55.750 sameeha siraj: then 701 01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:06.070 sameeha siraj: 15. 702 01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:09.709 Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. Seen as the yep, perfect. 703 01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.110 sameeha siraj: And then. 704 01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:16.780 sameeha siraj: okay. So the ratio 705 01:25:18.090 --> 01:25:20.289 sameeha siraj: so DA is 4 706 01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:21.990 Jenny Duan: perfect 707 01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:32.120 sameeha siraj: so 708 01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:39.399 sameeha siraj: this like given side. it should equal 709 01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:44.469 sameeha siraj: to like comply with the ratio. 710 01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.419 sameeha siraj: it should equal 12. 711 01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.769 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect, perfect. You're getting it. 712 01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:57.350 sameeha siraj: And in order to make that equal we'd have to make this one equal to at 8 713 01:25:57.610 --> 01:26:02.9",
    "60 sameeha siraj: And for that we need to multiply. We need X to equal to 2 714 01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:04.220 sameeha siraj: right? 715 01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:11.410 sameeha siraj: And then that way to find these ones. 716 01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:13.190 sameeha siraj: We can. 717 01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.559 sameeha siraj: We can just do 5 times 2, which is 10. 718 01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.529 Jenny Duan: That's correct, perfect. Okay, do you feel it? Okay. 719 01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:29.209 Jenny Duan: this is such a hard concept. But you got it really quickly. Do you feel like you understand this completely? Or are there any aspects of link. 720 01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:43.849 Jenny Duan: this 3, 4, 5, triangle? Similar triangle situation that you don't understand? Because this is like a couple of different things that they're assessing you on. They're assessing you on your knowledge of right triangles, similar triangles, and like specific right triangles. But do you feel like you understand this? 721 01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:51.639 sameeha siraj: I think definitely like the exes. Help me like kind of organize it better, because I was a bit more confused before. 722 01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:57.690 sameeha siraj: so yeah, I think I understand it. But I don't know. Like, are there any more like 723 01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:01.219 sameeha siraj: triangle ratios about to memorize other than this one 724 01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:07.370 Jenny Duan: like the 45, 45 90, which would just be let me just write that down. 725 01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:08.740 Jenny Duan: It would be like 726 01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:13.530 Jenny Duan: XX, and then x square root. 2. 727 01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:18.399 Jenny Duan: So me draw that 728 01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:22.809 Jenny Duan: like XX 729 01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.239 Jenny Duan: x root 2. 730 01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:36.070 Jenny Duan: This is called 45, 45, 90, and there's also 30, 60, 90, which is 731 01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.330 Jenny Duan: whi",
    "ch is x 732 01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.029 Jenny Duan: x 2 XX times square 3. 733 01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:50.709 Jenny Duan: So let me just draw that one 734 01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:56.979 Jenny Duan: But other than these, these are the main 3 that you'll need to know. 735 01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.510 sameeha siraj: Okay. 736 01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:05.990 Jenny Duan: okay. 737 01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:09.460 Jenny Duan: awesome. 738 01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:16.390 Jenny Duan: So do you want to take a screenshot of this? Have you gotten it all written down 739 01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:17.900 cool 740 01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.800 Jenny Duan: before we wrap. There's something I really want to show you. Quickly. 741 01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:26.380 Jenny Duan: and 742 01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:38.159 Jenny Duan: Then we can wrap up. I know it's been a long session today, so thanks for your perseverance. I just wanna get this on your radar because it's 743 01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:46.710 Jenny Duan: the deadlines approaching. And I think you should apply. So this is something called a young arts. Oh, let me, can I share my screen? 744 01:28:47.270 --> 01:29:09.820 Jenny Duan: This is something called young Arts. It's in national arts competition. But one of the things they offer is a film competition. And I think that if you're if you want to seriously enter apply as a film major again to to schools like Usc, Us. And Ucla. You should have some more like film things on your resume and on your activities. So I would like you to apply for this. 745 01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.110 Jenny Duan: And 746 01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:22.689 Jenny Duan: this is just a film competition, the short field. It's for high school students. It's very prestigious. It's national and let me just show you like we can look at Henry Spritz film. 747 01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:26.690 Jenny Duan: We can just look at a couple of seconds of it. We don't have to watch the whole thing. 748 01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:32.170 Jenny D",
    "uan: Cause it's quite long. Can you see this? Can you hear the sound or no? 749 01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:39.719 sameeha siraj: I think the sound stopped. 750 01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:45.250 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me share computer stuff. Okay. 751 01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:47.070 Jenny Duan: you're now. 752 01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:48.180 sameeha siraj: yeah. 753 01:29:54.910 --> 01:30:02.390 Jenny Duan: let's just go to the middle. It's a long film. So I'm just gonna skip to the middle to show you what it is. 754 01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:28.489 Jenny Duan: Let's just look at another one. This is not a Psa. 755 01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:32.879 Jenny Duan: This is only 3 min long, so your film doesn't have to be long 756 01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:35.750 from the metaphysical to the physical. 757 01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:41.960 Jenny Duan: metaphysical. 758 01:30:43.520 --> 01:31:00.190 Kingsville. 3 k. 2. Gold blemish blood, dirty, cheap, 3 beautiful elephant figurines carved out of my own life to be mixed, I mean gray, and don't people say black makes them look slim. 759 01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:07.270 Better, more a black brother, father, uncle, cousin, best friend, was shot at. 760 01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:12.789 Jenny Duan: and that's it. Alright. Let's look at one more example. 761 01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:37.910 Jenny Duan: No fan of Andy. This is what's called anyways. The point is to give you some examples of student films. And these are the types of films that you will wanna make for your portfolio if you're applying as a film major. And this is kind of like the quality that you should aim for. I'm gonna just turn the quality up. So it's clear. And this is the type of thing that you'll want on your portfolio 762 01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:39.520 Jenny Duan: when applying. 763 01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:42.830 Wait, can't you? Just 764 01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:55.850 Jenny Duan: there? Let me just jump to the middle again, so you can see before Andy this one happened. Then we split up. This is ",
    "one is like, has some dialogue in it. 765 01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:09.790 You tore them all down. I was going to 766 01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.550 what happened. 767 01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:17.239 What are you doing? 768 01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:19.780 Jenny Duan: Anyways. 769 01:32:31.730 --> 01:32:34.020 sameeha siraj: my screen is frozen. I think 770 01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:43.340 Ivy Mentors: we're losing 771 01:32:46.390 --> 01:33:15.979 Jenny Duan: okay. Anyways, you can watch it in your own time. But this is just to give you an idea of the types of projects that you might want to think about creating when doing like a film portfolio or just applying as a film major in general. So this next week I want you to just look at this and you can see, like the most competitive films are well edited and showcase, original and clear storytelling, while demonstrating strong elements of character and film. So I want you to think about applying for this award because 772 01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:22.810 Jenny Duan: I feel like. and this is something that you should look into, and something I feel like might be 773 01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:35.590 Jenny Duan: a good thing to have on your resume, and also something fun to do. On your own time. So yeah, it's called young Arts. I'm gonna put a link for this in your doc. So that you're aware of it. But 774 01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:40.910 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's a national art competition. It's very competitive, and I think you should enter 775 01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:53.089 Jenny Duan: it'll take some time, though, if you wanna seriously enter to do film because it's a hard, you know. Category. Are there any like 776 01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:59.060 Jenny Duan: I let's look. 777 01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:12.230 Jenny Duan: I think I remember applying. I also had to do some type of video. I think you have to do like an explanation of your piece. So you have to do the film. And then you, I think you have to write an application 778 01:34:12.240 --> 01",
    ":34:21.200 Jenny Duan: an application about you know why you made this, or like the story behind what you made. Let's see. 779 01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:23.540 Jenny Duan: And it has to be a portfolio, too. 780 01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:32.710 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm not actually sure. But I think this week you should make an account, and just take a look at it. 781 01:34:32.810 --> 01:35:01.340 Jenny Duan: The deadline is October eleventh. So that's why it's a bit of a rush you have about a month. If you actually want to do this to shoot and film and again, your video doesn't have to be long. You saw one of the previous winners was only 3 min long. So you don't have to make a long video. It just has to be something that you think is representative of your best work. And you can look at these examples. And I'm sure if you search up on Youtube, if you just search up like young Arts film, you can look at some other submission examples, too. 782 01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:02.510 sameeha siraj: Alright. 783 01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:06.959 Jenny Duan: cool. Yeah. 784 01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.190 Jenny Duan: Take care. 785 01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:14.219 Ivy Mentors: So I mean, what's what's your conclusion on the side? Jenny. 786 01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:16.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think. 787 01:35:17.530 --> 01:35:31.920 Jenny Duan: I think, Huda, I think you should do some more practice throughout the week, and I think my question for you is, do you feel like, what do you feel like? Is your biggest hold? Do you feel like it's content, or do you feel like it's time? I think that's one hypothesis we can test this week. 788 01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:59.500 sameeha siraj: But what do you think definitely like, time is like my biggest issue? For some, like some of the sections like, I think, reading I do pretty well, and like I I think for most of the tests I've done I barely get wrong and like the meeting section. But for like, I think the math section there's like a few. It's just I just get ",
    "really stuck on. And I need to like spend a lot of time on one question, which I kind of 789 01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:06.029 sameeha siraj: the longer I take, I guess the more like worried I am that I have less time. So 790 01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.200 sameeha siraj: yeah. 791 01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:12.399 Jenny Duan: I feel like what might be helpful for you is 792 01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:36.169 Jenny Duan: to get like someone an SA. Tutor, to just spend 1 h with you every week to just review the questions that you get wrong like I honestly feel like, I don't feel like you are lacking that much content. Wise, for example, grammar. I don't think you're lacking like pretty much at all. You didn't get any questions wrong there. For math, maybe like a couple of things, but II don't think you need to sit in like 793 01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:54.870 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to sit in like a boot camp. Does that make sense like, I don't think you need to be sat and like taught how to do things cause it. Seems like most of the content, is there. I think maybe because every test is a little bit different. To catch those edge cases that you just don't know. Maybe it'd be helpful to have someone. Just sit with you for 1 HA week, and just 794 01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:05.190 Jenny Duan: as you do practice throughout the week, just get compile like a list of the questions that you don't know how to do, and then at the end, just have one person just go over all of them with you at the end of the week. I think 795 01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:24.019 Jenny Duan: that is why I would recommend for you, as well as just more practice throughout the week. So if you can just up the practice and do like 30 min a day at least 30 or 45 min. Just do one section just do like one reading section or one grammar section or one math. No calculator, one math calculator, something like that every single day. I think that will help you a lot. 796 01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:25.780 sameeha siraj: Okay, great",
    ". 797 01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:28.900 Thank you. 798 01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:46.430 Ivy Mentors: Jenny? Thanks a lot, I think. La, yeah, you don't worry about my section. Today. I think I just want to like prioritize my, my kids here, and it's good. I also have another new gentleman for you or he's by. He's my younger. 799 01:37:46.490 --> 01:38:12.740 Ivy Mentors: yeah, an anonymous way you can't. You're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're 800 01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:34.529 Jenny Duan: but I will send you a link. And if you have some time, would you be able to do a short video testimonial? It'd be really helpful for other students and just helpful for me to improve as we continue working together. Of course, it's just gonna be like a video recording or an audio recording it'll be a video recording but again, it'll only be shared in like an anonymous and privacy preserving way. 801 01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:46.449 sameeha siraj: Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thank you so much. And yeah, I think I'm gonna talk to your brother now. Feel free to hang out or log off and do something else with your time. Take a break. It's been a long session. Okay, thank you. 802 01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:57.939 Ivy Mentors: Thank you. Thanks. Yeah, Jenny. I think it's fine. I mean, we can actually do our session later. I think it's good that you are like with us both sessions. And Whoa, Whoa! Don't don't play with them. Okay? 803 01:38:58.150 --> 01:39:10.179 Ivy Mentors: So yeah, I'd send you I think, on the on the after. After we speak to over that I'll tell you like 5 min I'll send you something, and you can actually have a look at it, and then we can connect later. So he's aware. 804 01:39:10.440 --> 0",
    "1:39:19.810 Ivy Mentors: and I think he'll introduce himself. I'm 8 years old. I'm a third grader, and I have my own Youtube channel. 805 01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:24.210 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's awesome. Do you wanna show me your Youtube channel? I'd love to see it. 806 01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:33.549 Ivy Mentors: Okay, let me let me let. Oh, so that's what you are doing. Okay. You know what he was actually playing with this whole thing all this time, and I was like, why is he doing it. He was just getting up to show you 807 01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:34.970 Ivy Mentors: his Youtube channel? 808 01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:45.330 Ivy Mentors: what's the name? Homer ranch kid 809 01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:54.580 Ivy Mentors: branch? Good. Yeah. 810 01:39:58.730 --> 01:40:01.779 Ivy Mentors: no brand. Wait. 811 01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:15.610 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. Why don't you just show me your software. Is that the range? No, no, no, no, no! I think he's probably struggling to use the. you know, like these are like outdated things right 812 01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.950 Ivy Mentors: for for the younger generation. This one. 813 01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.430 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. Next lunch. 814 01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:31.170 Ivy Mentors: I just support silly stuff on here. I do use for fun, you know. Just a hobby. I'm not sure if I can see your screen. I think it's still 815 01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:35.569 Ivy Mentors: I only see like a new tab. I don't see the Youtube channel. 816 01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.569 Ivy Mentors: Sorry over there, Noah, just give me a sec. 817 01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.459 Ivy Mentors: That's the thing with 818 01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:52.500 Ivy Mentors: for this one. Right? Yeah. 819 01:40:52.910 --> 01:41:03.000 Ivy Mentors: I just thank you for fun. You know. Cool this guy. I don't just, you know, upload videos. And then I just expect a thousand views, all of them. 820 01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:09.630 Ivy Mentors: I just want to entertain people that's so awesome. Con",
    "grats on 321 subscribers. 821 01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.810 Ivy Mentors: Oh, I've I'll I've had like 100 subscribers the last year. 822 01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:16.700 Ivy Mentors: I always 823 01:41:16.710 --> 01:41:22.139 Ivy Mentors: video. Oh, no, this kind of had. It's a little scary. 824 01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:24.630 Ivy Mentors: But like, you know. 825 01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:30.099 Ivy Mentors: okay, that's okay from a poppy work. Video. 826 01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:37.490 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I can hear. 827 01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:44.680 Ivy Mentors: And then. Now, that's like my most 90,000, 828 01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:58.600 Ivy Mentors: 39000, no. 390000, sorry. 39,000. Okay, see how how he's a metric guy, you know, like completely metric driven. 829 01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:08.859 Ivy Mentors: And and is this lowest of the year? Designor? Yeah, I did design him. I kind of got some inspiration from some characters and like games. I like. 830 01:42:09.230 --> 01:42:10.200 Ivy Mentors: okay. 831 01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:28.329 Ivy Mentors: is that the agenda after his discussion? Probably not. I think. Yeah. But anyways, II think he's that's how he's that's his identity, right? He wants to be. What do you want to be when you grow up? See what kind of generation you're dealing with, Jenny, you know, that's the thing. 832 01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:29.650 Ivy Mentors: So 833 01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:34.469 Ivy Mentors: anyways, I think, I yeah, okay, say, thanks. You know. Thanks for your time. 834 01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:35.730 Ivy Mentors: So 835 01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:42.950 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think, I just wanted to introduce. Because, yeah, you're such a celebrity now at home. And 836 01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:47.119 Ivy Mentors: also, like I was as as we were thinking and and about 837 01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.680 Ivy Mentors: really like identifying and trying to give better access, you know, for 838 01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:56.679 Ivy Mentors: young students. And you kno",
    "w, kids, you know, to really hone their skills. 839 01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:05.629 Ivy Mentors: I think Omar is no different. I think elementary school is still better, I would say, like, you know, there is some personal care, but still, like, you know, the in terms of just the 840 01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:11.779 Ivy Mentors: access to, you know, different kind of things. It's it's it's slightly hard here. 841 01:43:11.850 --> 01:43:21.940 Ivy Mentors: And I was really figure there, you know I was really trying to see, you know, if there are any early kind of student, and there are a lot of programs right? So I search. And I was surprised like there are like hundreds of 842 01:43:22.050 --> 01:43:33.219 Ivy Mentors: for like as early as like, you know, third grade, second grade. I was like shocked literally. Right? So I said, You know, I don't wanna like jump into this emotional thing and then sign him up for something. I would just probably consult with you 843 01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:41.699 Ivy Mentors: areas that I feel like he's got a Mac for number one definitely is animation and creative creativity skill. Right? He's quite ahead. 844 01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:44.000 Ivy Mentors: He started this when he was 6 years old. 845 01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.230 Jenny Duan: Wow. 846 01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.340 Ivy Mentors: yeah. So thank you. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. 847 01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:51.119 Ivy Mentors: My channel is actually 848 01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:54.390 Ivy Mentors: okay. She can't see it now. But how old is it. 849 01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:11.410 Ivy Mentors: January. 850 01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.239 Ivy Mentors: yeah. So the thing is like, yeah, definitely, like, one of the thing is this animation right? 851 01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:24.200 Ivy Mentors: And again, like knowing, like, how important like it's, it's not really about colleges at the end of the day, but I think also an opportunity to really like. 852 01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:27.580 Ivy Mentors: if thi",
    "s could really be the thing for him to really be that 853 01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:30.149 Ivy Mentors: kind of very kind of 854 01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:50.050 Ivy Mentors: growing to really someone like wonderful right in this particular field. I'm more than happy like, I don't want kids to really pursue. And and most in the age of AI, right? It's all about human intelligence. And and he coined some term today, he said, what was that you just said artistic intelligence 855 01:44:50.050 --> 01:45:05.069 Ivy Mentors: actually never even heard of that? So I think it's good to know. So that's number one like animation is this thing, I think writing comic books, and all that, you know. He's so good at like story, so he'll just pick up a paper and write that kind of you know, story line 856 01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:08.179 Ivy Mentors: you know that you see in studio and all that. 857 01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:27.049 Ivy Mentors: Easily. He'd do that. And I think also, like we had this kind of graduation party. and we we were all like, you're scared to kind of go up on the stage and speak. And this Guy just came and grabbed the mic and started speaking in front of everyone like, you know. So he's got the thing like speaking as well like 858 01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:31.720 Ivy Mentors: quite different than Houda, you know, different personality. 859 01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:44.360 Ivy Mentors: So I think debate creativity stuff. These are the kind of things I'm thinking about. So I don't know. What would you recommend like? And if if there's any like debate definitely debate, I want him to kind of get into public speaking early on 860 01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:51.859 Ivy Mentors: any programs that you're familiar with. I would love him to kind of join or anything on animation and creativity stuff as well. 861 01:45:52.340 --> 01:46:10.050 Jenny Duan: Definitely so a couple of things that come up to mind. I'm when I think about like young young students, and also I love your passion. I lov",
    "e your energy, and I want you to keep that think some of the things that are for to start young. Are are you interested in any sports 862 01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:21.929 Jenny Duan: play basketball. Sarge, I think, like for young students, the things that are really time sensitive are the first number. One thing is like sports. 863 01:46:21.930 --> 01:46:33.709 Jenny Duan: If you want to be an athlete, or if you want to do athletics that, and if you want that to be a central part of your identity or personality or 864 01:46:33.710 --> 01:47:00.560 Jenny Duan: like activities. Now is a good time to start and get good coaches for that, because a lot of the sports. You can't start you can't really start after you're in middle school pretty much otherwise you will not really be like you won't have the same opportunities to be good at them compared with other students. So if you're interested in doing a sport seriously, and if you wanna do a sport for fun, then, obviously, that's awesome. You should totally do it. But if you want to seriously pursue or start a new sport and train at like 865 01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:19.459 Jenny Duan: a national international level then now is the time to think about that. And if that's something that you choose not to do that's awesome. Not everyone has to do sports sports are, you know, like for some people, sports is their passion, and so now is the time they should put more energy into that. But if that's not your passion. Then, obviously, then, you should not do that because that's not your passion 866 01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:35.370 Ivy Mentors: or animation. Yeah, go ahead. I wanna try being a tennis champion, you know. you wanna try being a tennis champion. Okay? Awesome maybe should look into tennis. And then also with tennis tennis looking to squash and pickle ball. 867 01:47:35.470 --> 01:48:00.689 Jenny Duan: squash, pickle, ball, racquetball, Badminton, and any other racket based sport. Tennis is awesome. Tennis is also, there's a",
    " lot of tennis players so to stand out as a tennis player is, gonna be harder than to stand out, as say, like a squash or Badminton player, or like ping power. Literally any other racket sport that has less people playing it. You wanna look for a sport that has less people in the field 868 01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:25.419 Jenny Duan: because that'll give you a higher opportunity of being successful. That being said, you also wanna look for a sport where you feel like you have a natural like affinity towards. For example, like water. Polo is a sport where not a lot of people do water polo. But like, for example, if you're if you don't like swimming. Then you shouldn't just do a sport because there's not a lot of people in it. You should do a sport that you really like. So if you really like tennis, and that's how you choose. Then obviously, it's still very possible to be very successful, and you should still do it. 869 01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:41.440 Jenny Duan: So choose something that's at the intersection of what you like and what you think you're good at, and also what not a lot of other people are doing, because that'll give you the highest possibility to stand out for animation and art. There's a lot of things that I think you should think about entering, for example. 870 01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:51.940 Jenny Duan: There's a lot of art contest, animation, contests, film contests, even for young students like you, for example. Every single year there's the Google logo contest. Have you heard about this? 871 01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:53.210 Ivy Mentors: Oh, I do. 872 01:48:53.820 --> 01:49:05.430 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Google, Doodle, the Doodles, Google, Google, Doodle competition. That's kind of a brain teaser. So I think, stuff like that. You should enter 873 01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:32.399 Jenny Duan: And, for example, it wouldn't it be cool to have one of your animations as the Google Logo for a day like. I think that would be awesome, and I think that you should look into t",
    "hings like that and if you just do a search of, for example, like art contest for elementary school students, you should probably get a list of a lot of things like that. Google Doodle comes to the top of my mind. There's other logo contests. 874 01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:44.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. So there's things like the Google Doodle contest. There's other logo design contests. And there's also just other art and animation contests for students. So those are some things that you should look into. Also. 875 01:49:44.600 --> 01:50:11.979 Jenny Duan: you make a public portfolio like once you have a couple of films or animations done. You should start sharing that with and your dad help you with this. I don't think you should run like a public social media by yourself. But if your dad and you can work together to maybe start sharing some of your animations, once you start building a following, like you're doing on Youtube, there will be like brands and other things that wanna work with you. So you could end up doing animations for companies for like small businesses for brands, like 876 01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:23.319 Jenny Duan: doing some of their logo design. Even though you're young, if you have the talent, and obviously you have the talent and the skill. People will want to work with you, and they'll recognize that. So don't think that your age is a barrier, because it's not 877 01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:47.360 Jenny Duan: and then other things that I would look into. Siraj are for like gifted and talented programs at. You know, the middle school level. Sometimes you can test into those. So I'd be mindful of that. I know in Oregon. I don't know about California, but in Oregon, gifted and talented programs. The testing begins in third grade. So third, fourth, fifth grade you're doing testing. So I would look into that. And then also, there's things like 878 01:50:47.770 --> 01:51:03.379 Jenny Duan: Davidson, young scholars. Let me put in the chat. If you want to go",
    " an academic route as well. There's a lot of academic programs that you can look into for young students like Center for talented youth. This is called Johns Hopkins. 879 01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.930 Jenny Duan: There's also Davidson, young scholars, things like that 880 01:51:07.230 --> 01:51:12.870 Jenny Duan: rise for the future, which are a prize for for the future. 881 01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:38.850 Jenny Duan: Diana, award things like this, which are a lot of which are prestigious competition, slash awards for young people that want to make a difference in the world. So if you take your animation to the next level, you can use it for, like different public awareness campaigns to raise awareness on different social issues. You can use it to, you know, educate people on things that you're passionate about, that. You feel like, the world needs to hear. For example, if what you care about is 882 01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:54.599 Jenny Duan: environmental advocates, you can make you know animations about that, and combine your passion for animation with something else that can make a change in the world. Or if your passion is like cultural awareness, or if your passion is healthcare education, something like that you can combine your 883 01:51:54.830 --> 01:52:01.619 Jenny Duan: your passions for animation, and also for another campaign. Another thing is, Khan Academy 884 01:52:02.730 --> 01:52:24.739 Jenny Duan: has a video making competition. I'm not sure if this is limited to high school students, so I will need to verify this. But if it's open to younger students, you will have the opportunity to make an educational video about some subject that you're interested in. So maybe you're interested in math, you can in these concepts. They don't have to be super difficult. They just you just have to be able to explain them in a way that 885 01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:37.250 Jenny Duan: you can teach people. So if you're able to take any concept. It doesn't have to be hard. I",
    "t could be anything from, you know, algebra, chemistry, science, something that you're interested in and make a video like a 2 min video on it. You could win 886 01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:48.229 Jenny Duan: like a pretty big award. So there's, you know, awards you can enter. And then for public speaking. I think speech and debate starts at the middle school level. So is speech and debate something that you'd be interested in, do you think? 887 01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:52.289 Ivy Mentors: Oh, yeah, awesome. Can I join young arts? 888 01:52:52.440 --> 01:53:03.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, young hearts, I think you can join. I think young hearts might only be for high school. By the way, he's completely like ultra competitive guy. Awesome. That's awesome. 889 01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:14.030 Jenny Duan: I think young art is only for high school students. But I think scholastic arts and writing you can join here. Let me look into this really quickly. 890 01:53:14.050 --> 01:53:19.390 Ivy Mentors: How do you know all of this? I'm so amazed, you know, like it's like it's like on your fingertips, you know, Jenny. 891 01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:33.439 Jenny Duan: I have. This is like one of my passions like that. I just I've always been thinking about. So I think I think arts and writing can. I'm gonna check if you can do, young students. 892 01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:42.640 Jenny Duan: I am not sure what the age limit is, though it might be middle. I know middle schoolers can do it. I don't know if elementary schoolers can do it. 893 01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:45.169 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you have to be 13 enough 894 01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:56.070 Jenny Duan: 13. So I think you're still a little bit young, but you know something to keep on the radar and then there's also different public speaking competitions. 895 01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:59.790 Jenny Duan: even for young students. 896 01:53:59.850 --> 01:54:22.559 Jenny Duan: So let me just do a quick search. And there's also like video competitions. So ",
    "if you like, want to make a video or like a Psa on something we could also combine like passion for animation and public speaking. So you can make an animation do a voiceover for that, and then you can practice both of those skills. By the way, today. 897 01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:42.549 Ivy Mentors: he he just hits a noisy room, you know, it's like, well, I need my studio already, like, yeah, in the studio. Wow! He uses my closet as a studio. So he comes in, and so awesome. Let me just put a link into the chat and feel free to just look at this in your own time 898 01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.839 Jenny Duan: might be a Uk list. Sorry. 899 01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:57.610 Jenny Duan: Never mind, disregard this. Let me give you a new list. I want to give you a Us. List has been on his list, you know. He's been. He's been like torturing everyone to go to Uk. Huh? 900 01:54:57.670 --> 01:55:02.279 Ivy Mentors: This, I mean, if you join this competition, we'll all come over with you. 901 01:55:02.970 --> 01:55:08.090 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is just a list of it's a list of different competitions. You can look into. It's like 902 01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:13.700 Jenny Duan: competitions for public speaking, reading aloud poetry, things like that. Yeah. 903 01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:25.969 Ivy Mentors: amazing. I mean, I was really like not really thinking about competitions. It was more like to prep. Right? I think it's a good time for him to prepare. But I mean competitions definitely are a good way to prepare in some ways right? It's just like. 904 01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.270 Ivy Mentors: right? So. 905 01:55:28.590 --> 01:55:30.769 Jenny Duan: totally. So, I think, yeah. 906 01:55:30.830 --> 01:56:00.010 Jenny Duan: just doing. I think competitions is mainly because it gives. The thing about competitions is not actually about winning the award. It's more about giving yourself a platform to showcase your work, or for other people to see your work, because when you enter a competiti",
    "on, obviously like you're presenting in front of a lot of people. So it's just the practice of you know, delivering your work, or doing a public speech, or something to a large audience of people. So oh, also, you can look into doing like 907 01:56:00.670 --> 01:56:26.670 Jenny Duan: different, like public speaking engagements in your own community, too. For example, if you have like a festival, or if you have, you know, a party like a celebration. Maybe you can volunteer to like, give a speech there, and also just have those opportunities to practice, or in your school in your elementary school. If you have an opportunity to like, give a speech to frame your school for like a fundraiser, or for you know, something like that, you can also maybe try to volunteer and see if you're able to do that, too. 908 01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:34.369 Ivy Mentors: if I try doing a sticker raffle. But I'm still not able to make the stickers. I can make a sticker. But I'm still too lazy to make a stickers. 909 01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:36.320 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. 910 01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:46.640 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think I think he's going to like, you know. I mean again, because this is such a. In fact, you know, communities like ours where there isn't really like good access to everything right, like a lot of people do it. 911 01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:58.909 Ivy Mentors: You know, the funny thing is, lot of the people who stay here actually all like work in great companies and all that. I think people just move here during Covid because of, you know, like bigger space to live. And you know, like 912 01:56:59.170 --> 01:57:12.420 Ivy Mentors: the houses are good, and you know the people like hardly thought about the other implications. But it's a new community. And the problem is now like people come together. There's a lot of voluntary work happening. So Omar didn't like a public schools thing or thing. Just start. 913 01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:40.830 Ivy Mentors: You're going to one right o",
    "n a weekly basis. Someone's running like a nonprofit thing. Correct. The whole idea like going somewhere meaning some random. But I in school like, it's a lot in my school class. There's a lot of annoying kids. Okay, I think we can talk about that. Okay, cool. I think that's fine. I think we can. I just wanted to kind of like, you know. Motivate him number one meet. 914 01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:56.300 Ivy Mentors: Have you also beat? By the I mean I still oh, I have. I need to ask my older daughter to meet you as well like, you know. Might be she'll get some good tips as well. But okay, Omar say, thank you. I wanna wrap up. She's it's been a long day for her, like we, we've used literally 2 h, 3 h of her time today. 915 01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:05.030 Ivy Mentors: Have fun. Good luck with your Youtube channel. It's looking amazing and keep up the good work 916 01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:10.540 Ivy Mentors: you're so passionate about, like, even like, you know, elementary and middle schoolers more than high schoolers, I see. 917 01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:34.550 Jenny Duan: I think. I think elementary schoolers are awesome, because, you know, they still have a lot of their passion. I think sometimes high schools lose passion for things, not your sister. Your sister is very passionate, but other high schoolers, you know, don't always heard that. Elementary schools are schoolers are cool. He came back. 918 01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:37.580 Ivy Mentors: Okay, Worsley, thank you again. 919 01:58:38.770 --> 01:58:40.340 Nice to meet. You. 920 01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.219 Ivy Mentors: Say. Nice to meet you as well. Nice to meet you as well. 921 01:58:43.410 --> 01:58:48.650 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I mean, honestly, like, I'm actually planning now, now that I know all the landscape 922 01:58:48.930 --> 01:59:06.119 Ivy Mentors: in some ways, I want to really solve and want to make like I want to really show I'm I'm so passionately committed that public schoolers with people like",
    " yourselves help can actually make it. But you know within me like. I also know that. Okay, I don't want to repeat the same mistake for my son now. 923 01:59:06.210 --> 01:59:11.569 Ivy Mentors: right because I've kind of II just feel like there is so many things that are unfortunately not 924 01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:13.939 Ivy Mentors: available like, it's often. 925 01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:18.279 Ivy Mentors: yeah, thanks. Jenny, how are you doing otherwise? 926 01:59:18.690 --> 01:59:22.270 Jenny Duan: I'm pretty good. I've been really, really busy, like 927 01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:41.500 Jenny Duan: I have my tool. Do list is like endless right now. But I've taken a look at your document, and I should be able to mark comments today. I think that got to market strategy I've been thinking about with Korea market is doing the webinars, and I think that partnering with international schools might be a good way to target, because if we're able to like. 928 01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:58.880 Jenny Duan: I don't know exactly what this would look like. But I did some research, and it seems like other organizations. Some things. What they do is they just partner with the school, and then the school will give them inbound and like recommend their service and maybe they'll do like a free webinar at their school or something, and then the school will just like help them promote their service. 929 01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:08.619 Jenny Duan: So that's a way to get like targeted international customers. If we just promote 2 international schools or just doing like just targeted Korea Webinar. 930 02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:14.670 Jenny Duan: and like. yeah. And then I could help like, maybe with that. 931 02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:17.179 Ivy Mentors: I mean, that is impressive. Right? 932 02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:30.079 Ivy Mentors: And honestly, like this whole product. Strategy was just for you, right to kind of take a stab at it, and I'm not a big fan of strategy, and I think specially you wi",
    "ll see this when you work at tech companies like, I think, Mackenzie. And 933 02:00:30.150 --> 02:00:41.409 Ivy Mentors: you know, mainly, Mackenzie. I think the people have spent so much money on, and I think they just find like, with all due respect, I think tech companies really help Mackenzie and kind of strategist, right? They kind of use for certain roles. 934 02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:50.140 Ivy Mentors: But the point is like, unless you do it unless you get to market. And I think that's something very uniquely. You're very gifted. Because when you talk about like a strategic role, everyone would be like, Okay. 935 02:00:50.310 --> 02:01:13.759 Ivy Mentors: it's like someone who's very good at making Powerpoint and Dex. And you know, like there are certain people who are like that is what great at it like. That's their Nac. I think Shashi is one of those guys as an example right? He's like consultant. He works at ebay M. And a Vcs like investors, and all that. But I think going to market. So I'm honestly like that was just for just a framework for us to think about, and also gave me an opportunity to start thinking on. How am I thinking about the strategy. 936 02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:21.269 Ivy Mentors: But you have actually nailed. And you've identified. The more I've been like thinking and brainstorming. We have to really focus on 2 customer segments. 937 02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:36.039 Ivy Mentors: Number one is really mensio and number 2 is Nilima. I think this is where lot of opportunity for innovation, lot of opportunity for also revenue potential right and making a real impact is available. And there's a lot of underserved need. 938 02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:38.960 Ivy Mentors: Because when you think about late in the game, yeah, sorry God. 939 02:01:39.090 --> 02:02:07.699 Jenny Duan: I was gonna say, for we could do like a panel like public school, to to elite schools something like that, like half like Aaron, have students like other public school students w",
    "ith the same background and panel, specifically that try to get public school student, public bay area tech company students like parents work in tech company, maybe don't know a lot about the admissions process, but want to help their kids have the money to help their kids. That's the need to do a panel. They can see the impact 940 02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:15.379 Ivy Mentors: absolutely. I think you nailed it. It's music to yours, you remember. Like, when you told me, mensio as well. What did I say, we just need hyper specificity. 941 02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:25.870 Ivy Mentors: and I think qualifying, even like introducing you and a bunch of other mentors as a panel and say, How do you get into Iv. Or how do you get into Stanford is where the money is? 942 02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:32.699 Ivy Mentors: Because we don't, I mean, honestly, the more I'm thinking might be. The name is Stanford mentors. It's not even Iv mentors anymore. 943 02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:48.780 Ivy Mentors: Right? It could very well be Stanford mentors, because Stanford is still like that kind of premium school that probably has so much beyond just the Iv brand to it like the level to it. But I think Stanford mentors is harder to scale, because Stanford, you know, they only take like 944 02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:53.799 Jenny Duan: a small small class. And so we're not gonna be able to get as many students as if we broaden it. 945 02:02:53.910 --> 02:03:11.989 Ivy Mentors: And I think Iv sales is something that we have proven right. See? The more I'm trying to leave. Iv, I'm not able to, because that's what resonates with people like, especially with Korea. If you remove Iv, it's not gonna sell right? Ivy is like an emotional thing like you looked into that article right? Any article. And I think I've been really deep into this keyword research. 946 02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:29.769 Ivy Mentors: or what are students searching? Because that's how I wanna brand my even 360 ss, and all that honestly like. That'",
    "s not what people are searching for, like people are searching. What are my chances? How do I get into Xyz. What is my profile like an application review and things like that? Anyways, I'm working on that. But I'm very happy on the second point that you mentioned. 947 02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:42.049 Ivy Mentors: See, that is how I'm thinking. You know, you remember, like, it was all about enabling Iv access to everybody. But it's not even Ib access. It's about enabling the private level kind of support. 948 02:03:42.070 --> 02:04:05.719 Ivy Mentors: you know, to every student, right? Especially the public student public school student. And it could really be in that area where you have this magnet schools, or very competitive schools as well, that are under served as as an initial kind of very niche segment right? We could really uplift, you know, people who are just there, and they are not able to make it because they don't know certain strategies or tricks and tips. You know, things like that. 949 02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:24.350 Ivy Mentors: So love it. Yeah, I think, II just feel like with tech, you know. Again, I have an unfair market advantage, and I would love to tap into that. And I can clearly see again. I'm surprised how many parents you know. I have, like almost 1111 in my network, who really want to talk to me. 950 02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:33.510 Ivy Mentors: Even today I had a meeting. It's just that I'm trying to like, really build that a very good landing page with all the nice signals so that they can just go and they can be driven 951 02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:59.239 Ivy Mentors: but it is going to happen. But I think Korea is something where Jenny, on the strategy as well. What I would recommend is like a do. Don't be bothered about the strategy paper. You don't have to fill it. Okay, it was just like a. It was just my thought on, how am I seeing the strategy? Right? I use that framework from Apple mostly it's an apple framework on how to really think about ",
    "contrasting and starting different creating like new value, creating new experiences. 952 02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:12.330 Ivy Mentors: and I was like, I don't want to be another crimson, I mean, look at their deck and slides I've given you is the same story, right? Everyone's got the same story, holistic profile, strategic planning, tailored assistance, 101 comfort and all that. I think 953 02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:32.359 Ivy Mentors: this is where it's so important that specificity is where the money is and the specificity city has to be ultra amazing. So awesome. So I think, let's do this call in like one or 2 session. And and I mean again, as I said, I'm not a big. I'm not a big believer in number of hours. As long as there is impact on value. And I've seen that 954 02:05:32.650 --> 02:05:39.440 Ivy Mentors: I just want to crack the Korean market. And if you can really help identify. And you tell me, Suraj, okay. 955 02:05:39.690 --> 02:06:09.050 Ivy Mentors: For example, like, I don't expect you to know the Korean competitive landscape right? But I did speak to Anne. By the way, and I'm speaking to her. And, by the way, is in the Stanford entrepreneurial kind of thing, right? So she's she's very kind of Vc kind of profile, and and also she's economics, right? So she's now going to become a senior, and she's very well she's coming. She also comes from Hong Kong, right? So she followed that path of coming to a boarding school here. That kind of thing. So she's very familiar with that background. 956 02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:22.700 Ivy Mentors: So what we could do is is. See? At the end of the year, the owner, you're the you're the strategist and everything else right? So I just wanna make sure that you don't feel like oh, if I put in something like if I be, then I'll have to do it. You don't have to do it. You just have to be the lead 957 02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:29.340 Ivy Mentors: and help me really find what's the right way to go there and tell me what is the right str",
    "ategy? Right? 958 02:06:29.670 --> 02:06:52.829 Jenny Duan: I think Korea Webinar as soon as possible, I think. Give mince referral bonus if she can refer like However, many people, I don't know how we want to do this, but, like maybe, like per, every person who converts from Lindsay because they like, give her free session, give her like incentive, give her some incentive to help convert like free session. Maybe like 959 02:06:52.880 --> 02:07:02.730 Jenny Duan: you can just give her like, I think a free session is better than cash incentive. Sometimes you will do like referral. You get $25, but I think free session. I don't know if that's more valuable for her. 960 02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:24.220 Jenny Duan: give mensio Referral a referral credit, because Minto seems to have she, and she already seems to be doing this for free like she seems to be, you know, telling people about the service, and I think she's a pretty big advocate already, so I think she will be open to doing that. So get Minto to like share with her friends or her school, or like something like that. And I think 961 02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.350 Jenny Duan: we should aim for, like. 962 02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:34.659 Jenny Duan: I think, 25 to 50 families or students to join on a panel like Korea students, and I think that will be enough to get like 963 02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:37.170 Jenny Duan: a significant number of conversions. 964 02:07:37.260 --> 02:08:02.880 Ivy Mentors: I agree, II think, by the way, I've already done that right. So it's I already told her, like a 30 min extra session with Jenni on extra curriculars or college app anything of that sort. I even gave her like one session free with. Anne. I I've told her, because you know, she's economics, right and international relations, and I've already all always said so. I think she's probably in a different zone now, right like she's already like so so swarmed with her. 965 02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:08.129 Ivy Mentors: I don't think that has ",
    "necessarily been an incentivize like that's been a strong incentive for her. 966 02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.510 Ivy Mentors: Got it? But honestly. 967 02:08:10.650 --> 02:08:14.439 Ivy Mentors: I don't even mind giving her like you know 968 02:08:14.710 --> 02:08:25.459 Ivy Mentors: instead of spending money on a marketing campaign or things of that sort, I would rather give it to some agent like, you know, a mensio who can be an advocate, and she can really bring us, 969 02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:29.460 Ivy Mentors: very organically, like, you know, very highly qualified target right? 970 02:08:29.490 --> 02:08:34.970 Ivy Mentors: So happy to look into that. And II think that will be a part of the strategy, but also like international schools. 971 02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:46.059 Ivy Mentors: right? So whatever, based on whatever information you have your friends, right? You, you know, basically put the blueprint there. And you tell me that this is how I believe that we will be able to crack this market. 972 02:08:46.260 --> 02:09:11.349 Ivy Mentors: and what and you know, based on your intelligence around like the public schools there, what is the underserved segment there as well, right like underserved service as well like, you know. Extracurricular is what her mom said, and things like that. So make your assumptions put a hypothesis. Come with a very like, you know, strong hypothesis, and say, I believe if we do, Xyz will be able to crack this market. Come with that, and let's start with that. I'm a firm believer of doing. That 973 02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:12.750 Ivy Mentors: sounds good. 974 02:09:13.050 --> 02:09:31.140 Ivy Mentors: exactly, I think. Let's do that. And I think also in in Bay Area, I think. Meanwhile, I think 360 assess or like whatever I'm gonna call it. Now it's gonna happen. So I will start getting these leads. And how do we position is something that I would love to explore. But I would still put Korea as as top of 975 02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:40.870",
    " Ivy Mentors: the thing. But I think Korea and public school we can do in parallel. Anyways, I want to be respectful of your time. We've already spent too much time, but I just want to tell you what I'm working on heads down now. Right? 976 02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:42.330 Ivy Mentors: So, thank you. 977 02:09:42.590 --> 02:09:57.100 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. So and and and then we can really, like, you know, focus on one or 2 days. And see. So really at the end of the day. And this is like with Maddie back and forth, and all that, I think, landing Page, I think we need more and more social proof. 978 02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:07.210 Ivy Mentors: But I wouldn't just say like social proof in terms of just testimonial. That's the easiest thing to do. By the way, like, you know, you can cook up. You can create. You can put a fake name and Id and all that stuff. I don't want to do that. 979 02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:10.140 Ivy Mentors: Where I feel like we are lagging is 980 02:10:10.210 --> 02:10:29.930 Ivy Mentors: I want to really show that problem solution, that concept that we spoke about like it has to come out. What is this? 360 assess? It's not just a report, right? So I've been thinking about what the outline is. And let's say, for example, like. And again, how are we gonna name it as something I'm Con constantly. And now you just said hacks in one of your thing today, and I just put hacks. 981 02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:44.600 Ivy Mentors: It has to. Really, isn't it a senior coming in like, okay, this is my final stretch. And I wanna have a session with someone. I'm gonna pay $500. What am I getting out of it? That hook? I need to understand. It can be it, and people are searching for chance. Me! 982 02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:48.000 Ivy Mentors: How do I get? How do I boost my profile? Blah! Blah! Blah! 983 02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:52.320 Ivy Mentors: So this is the outline. See, as an example number one. 984 02:10:52.370 --> 02:11:04.890 Ivy Mentors: So real sessions, real strategie",
    "s, real desserts. Okay? So I've basically taken, even though she's kind of a junior. Now, I'm basically using the because if you think about the strategies that Ann laid out for her was really 30 days, 60 days plan. 985 02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:09.030 Ivy Mentors: So we are saying, Okay, these are the these are like. These are like real session. 986 02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:24.269 Ivy Mentors: Then talking about the report itself right? And this will come, so I'll be preparing a pitch for every service, and what I'll do is in my testimonial section. I'll put a flash where the things will keep changing or people can click next like this so that they see what the product is. 987 02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:36.120 Ivy Mentors: Then next identifying the hidden strength right like, what are we finding then, you know, finding the top weak spots and then working on like, how are we giving the Taylor strategy to fix it 988 02:11:36.420 --> 02:12:01.429 Ivy Mentors: right, and then showing what is the success? And this is this is where we have to be creative because we have to show the past success and say that we believe in this because this is what the admission officers look for, or just say that this is this is something that is the last resort, like, what else can someone do? So I'm working on this. And similarly like, you know, for for the the next one I'll I'll do a similar thing for your kind of 360 assess as well. 989 02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:06.889 Ivy Mentors: And I'm gonna share this with you. I think the landing page 990 02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:25.180 Ivy Mentors: I feel like we just need to focus on to hook service right? $500, $500, 499. Just land and pick one, I think. Once parents sign for one. I have, I'm confident, and they will look at the roadmap, and they'll sign up like Neilim as a good example. Right? So that is, that is my thinking right now. 991 02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:30.809 Ivy Mentors: But feel free to work on the strategy, and I will share this with you offl",
    "ine. And then you can actually 992 02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:36.060 coming, I mean, what do you think about it like, are you getting my idea like, how how we're planning to do it? 993 02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:39.909 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, this makes sense to me, yeah. 994 02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:47.840 Ivy Mentors: And then below this, what's gonna happen is like, we'll put the testimonial of prica. And you know Shashi as well 995 02:12:48.140 --> 02:13:09.710 Ivy Mentors: right like. So then, when someone looks at like my friend when it looks at this. Wow! They're already like these Asian migrant parents like. And I'm saying that this guy is actually this parent is also an Iv grad. Hands on people like, you know. So you see, like the social proof is a complex situation for a parent. And that's what actually Neilima liked as well. She was sold to, and she looked at the 996 02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:20.110 Ivy Mentors: profile. Right? The report! And this is staying lot of time, right? Because, it, it has to be very carefully crafted. And people are, gonna look at things that that's gonna hit the nail. And 997 02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:22.219 Ivy Mentors: that is what I'm focused on anyways. 998 02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:39.859 Ivy Mentors: Great all good thanks. So much for your time today for Huda, and also porumar. He's excited as well. So so where do you wanna catch up? I think. Yeah, you can put some thought on both the Korean, I think, feel free to put on Neil as well, I think. Let's do that as well. 999 02:13:39.930 --> 02:13:52.909 Jenny Duan: okay, let's do. Tuesday evening. Wednesday evening would be best Monday. I, since we already have Anushka's. I don't have time for another one. But Tuesday I should be good. 1000 02:13:53.040 --> 02:14:05.549 Ivy Mentors: I mean Tuesday, or even if you wanted to. Wednesday is fine, but I think for me right now, priority is to take this live. So I'm gonna work on that. And I think that's where I'll probably ping you and say, Hey, have a qu",
    "ick look if there's anything you want me to strengthen, strengthen it 1001 02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:10.269 Ivy Mentors: so let's keep tentatively Tuesday. But if you want to move it to Wednesday, I'm perfectly fine. 1002 02:14:10.630 --> 02:14:12.670 Ivy Mentors: And last thing. 1003 02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:20.690 Ivy Mentors: On your internships, let's get back to that. Honestly, the the guy did not respond to me, and I did not follow up with him. I need to go back. 1004 02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:24.600 Ivy Mentors: I do have a few ideas in mind. By the way, okay. 1005 02:14:24.610 --> 02:14:28.510 Ivy Mentors: so when you, when is your internship start date target start date. 1006 02:14:29.230 --> 02:14:31.739 Jenny Duan: I could start anytime, like. 1007 02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:37.269 Jenny Duan: probably mid June. But if if there's a strict start date in May, I can also go in May, too. 1008 02:14:37.970 --> 02:14:39.940 Ivy Mentors: Okay, so this is for next year. May 1009 02:14:40.110 --> 02:14:41.979 Jenny Duan: next year, next year, June. 1010 02:14:42.230 --> 02:14:49.690 Jenny Duan: But May is okay if it's required. But ideally, mid June is the start date mid June to September to late September. 1011 02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:53.160 Ivy Mentors: I didn't know that. So why are we doing this so early then? 1012 02:14:53.610 --> 02:14:56.540 Jenny Duan: Because tech cycle recruiting starts. Now. 1013 02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:58.150 Ivy Mentors: okay, yeah, yeah. 1014 02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:21.540 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think for the big companies, it does start right now. I think December is the time correct? Like November, December is probably the time, Jan to to to secure. But now is the time to apply. Okay, so this is really for next summer. Correct next summer. Okay, okay, it's very funny, because, you know, I actually was working with another Cmu girl actually, who got a very good internship with an AI startup. And and she was doing, okay, cool. 1015 02:15:21.580 --> 0",
    "2:15:28.090 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, let's let's do that. And I think once I meet you, I was also what I wanted to do was like, you know. 1016 02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:47.350 Ivy Mentors: just have a blast in my network, even though I'm in sales. I could always say that, hey, I've I've been working with this 2 amazing like, you know. kind of interns at my startup. Pm, and you know, please, I mean I will. I'll keep it anonymous. But I'll just kind of create that thing where people will reach out. Hey, wow! That's amazing. Like Stanford, pm, interns. 1017 02:15:47.370 --> 02:15:52.020 Ivy Mentors: you know. So so I want to do that. I wanted to consult with you before I do that. 1018 02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:59.200 Ivy Mentors: That's why II think it's it's gonna take time. So let's let's just strategize that as well when we meet. Okay. 1019 02:15:59.690 --> 02:16:01.380 Jenny Duan: sounds good. Thank you so much. 1020 02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.540 Ivy Mentors: Thank you. Thank you very much. 1021 02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:11.799 Jenny Duan: Perfect. All good. Right. See? You see it. See you? Yeah. Tomorrow, I mean, Anushka probably join or not. But I'll keep this thing 1022 02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:19.649 Ivy Mentors: and Tuesday I'll just go ahead and I'll book what? 5, 30 to 6 30 is okay for Tuesday. Cool. Thank you. 1023 02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:21.560 Ivy Mentors: Bye, bye."

Unless you fail, don't fail a class. Then you know your admissions could get revoked. But if you get Bs in your second semester. No one's going to like. 40 If you're a straight, a student, get B's.

But tell me if you already know this stuff, because I'm just like going from the very, very basic. So most of the stuff you might already know. But I'm just gonna repeat it for redundancy. But just let me know if you like, already know this so there's 3 ways to separate 2 independent clauses, a period, a semicolon, and a comma plus a coordinated conjunction. 87 so semicolon has the same usage as a period. So if you if you see a semicolon, it's basically like a period. So it separates 2 independent clauses. 88 A comma 89"

But if you have 2 independent clauses separated by a comma, that's a common spice, so you can't separate 2 independent clauses with a comma any time you see that happening that's just wrong. 90 So 2 separate 2 commas can separate independent clause from an independent clause. 91 However, they are not always separating a non essential clause, which means that an essential clause is basically the heart of a sentence. For example, if you say like 92 therefore she went to the store. 93 The part she went to the store would be the essential clause. 94 And so here's the chart of when you should use a comma 95"

I don't think you need to like explicitly memorize the rest. Okay? And then dashes and parentheses. Do you know these types of questions?

So there's 3 types of transitions, continuous contradictions and cause and effect. 105 So sometimes with transitions, what they're testing you for is how it connects to the rest of the, you know, piece or passage. So you need to identify what type of transition you're working with, and then decide what works best. 106 So, for example, there's like continuers that add information that gives an example, defy, clarify, emphasize, compared also contradictors. So these are your alternatively, conversely. 107 etc., and cause and effect. So when you have 2 sentences together, sometimes you need to identify what type of transition.
