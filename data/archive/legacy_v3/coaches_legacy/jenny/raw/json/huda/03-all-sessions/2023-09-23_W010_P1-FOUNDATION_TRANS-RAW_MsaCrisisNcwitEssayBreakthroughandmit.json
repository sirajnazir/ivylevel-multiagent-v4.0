How's it going? 2 00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.740 huda: Hi! I'm good. How are you? 3 00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.920 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well, I just moved into my new dorm on campus, so pretty excited about that. 4 00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:55.069 Jenny Duan: But yeah, so I know that's been like about a week since we've met. So I was thinking we could probably just get into it, as I think we have a lot to cover. Today. How does that sound? 5 00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.559 huda: Okay, that sounds great. 6 00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:15.120 Jenny Duan: awesome. So yeah, I'd love to just get some general life updates. I know it's been a little bit since we've talked so I'd love to know just like what's going on. And I? I know that we've been texting a little bit back and forth. So maybe we could start with those texts and go from there. 7 00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:37.719 huda: Yeah, okay, so I think a major like Win of this week was I was able to sign up for a world history on community college. But unfortunately, it wasn't letting me like sign up for anymore. I was trying to sign up for like senior year's English, so that that way I'd take more Ap's in school. 8 00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:57.009 huda: But it was. It was like telling that the deadline was too late, even though I've been preparing since, like before, the deadline. But my counselor, she only approved it after the deadline. So that was a bit frustrating. But I found. That's that's super frustrating, especially since that's not your fault, and 9 00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:08.460 huda: like that's completely out of your control, you know, despite your efforts, yeah. And I asked her if she could do anything about it, and she said, it's not in her reach and like she can't really make any changes. 10 00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.520 huda: So I guess like, that's kind of all the my community. College courses are starting on Monday. 11 00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:30.149 huda: and then another thing is, I started like so I kinda finished like my react course. So now, I'm starting to develop folklift website, 12 00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:47.059 huda: and then me, and like my like the partner for empowering AI we we finish our planning document for our first week slide. We're supposed to have a slideshow done by Friday. But, we're only we're like we have, like a couple of slides more to go. But 13 00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.550 huda: I'd say, like, we're pretty much done with the first weeks. And then we booked 14 00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.809 huda: library like rooms for us to hold a meeting. 15 00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.790 huda: yeah, it's gonna be like the the second starting the second week of October, I think. 16 00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.670 huda: on Sundays, and we're going to try to meet for like an entire month, like 17 00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.759 huda: once each week, like every Sunday. 18 00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:28.500 huda: cause like we have like 4 lessons planned. So yeah. And then we're also gonna make and then the winner gets like a prize or something. So 19 00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.950 huda: yeah, and then. 20 00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:39.999 huda: oh, yeah. So then the Msa election thing happened, the Muslim Student Association. And 21 00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.350 huda: it was. 22 00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.930 huda: it was like a really terrible experience. Because, yeah, so 23 00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:57.770 huda: basically, what happened was last year. They're like elected some guys who like cheated on the election 24 00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.739 huda: and basically they don't really like me, cause I guess we're like family friends. And then. 25 00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:15.330 huda: they kind of know that I'm trying to like, do these extra curriculars? And they're just not involved as well. So like they don't really like me in that way. So like. 26 00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:23.019 huda: What I found was that they removed my name from the mailing list so that I can't find out about the elections. 27 00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:47.179 huda: That's crazy. Yeah, I was like, that's like a whole nother level of petty. But no, that's so. That's like, isn't that a not allowed like, isn't that against school policy? Yeah. Me and me and a friend were like actually thinking of talking to like the like the club advisor about it. I think you definitely should. 28 00:06:47.330 --> 00:07:03.190 huda: Yeah. So either, we're like thinking that. And if nothing really happens, I think next year we might try starting like a Muslim girls group like a club. So cause we can discuss issues like this like 29 00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:31.130 huda: basically the officer roles like they're all boys. And they're like the same friend group, and then, like the President, she's handed her role from the last President, even though she wasn't an officer like at all, and one of the requirements is like you have to be an officer for at least one year in order to become President. So it was locally rigged. But yeah, what do you mean? Low key that rigged? 30 00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.320 huda: Yeah. 31 00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.169 Jenny Duan: Well, I think you should definitely bring this up with the advisor. How involved is is the advisor in the club? 32 00:07:38.720 --> 00:08:03.250 huda: I would say, actually, this club. It's honestly they barely have meetings or any events or anything. So I guess I guess, like the advisor isn't that involved? But we're gonna like, not the club advisor, but like the there's like the leadership teacher he like, basically in charge of all the clubs and everything. So we're gonna talk to him on Monday. 33 00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:13.960 Jenny Duan: that that's just like that's just awful that that happened, and that must be so frustrating. And 34 00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:35.090 Jenny Duan: I just wanna say like, Don't let this bring you down because I feel like this, isn't it? I mean, obviously it's not a mark on your character at all. But I know that the situation is extremely frustrating, and I think that you know I wouldn't actually wanna be in a club with these people, anyways. So I feel like it's totally fine that you're you're not involved with this, because, like. 35 00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:49.339 Jenny Duan: even if you did get an officer position, you would still have to work with these frustrating people, who would, you know, go out of their way to make it difficult for you. And that type of environment is just really, really negative and like bad for your mental health and everything else, too. 36 00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:57.589 huda: Okay? And like, I mentioned, like these guys who rig this election are the same people that did the 37 00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:04.909 huda: the hack phone club, the the experience like it's the same people. How is it? The same people 38 00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:12.369 huda: I don't know. They just like have like a giant, firm group, and they all like help each other cheat, and like different clubs and stuff. So 39 00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.700 Jenny Duan: that is just that is just terrible like, why has this ever? Has this been reported? 40 00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:30.759 huda: No, but, like honestly, like everyone, just lets it happen, because, like, they want to be friends with them. I don't know. I don't know why they get like. Why would they want to be friends with these people 41 00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:39.049 huda: cause like they benefit each other. So they they wanna be part of their like groups so that they can get their benefits. I guess I don't know 42 00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:49.640 Jenny Duan: but the benefits of cheating or the benefits I don't know. Cause almost like locate. Every single election at our school is really rigged. So 43 00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.440 huda: yeah, we're trying to like for film Makers club. At least, we're trying to do like a really unbiased like. 44 00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:13.380 huda: not at all like relationships with the officers kind of thing and like it has to be fair, and I feel like applications are so much stronger than elections, because elections you can cheat easily, but totally. You could just get all your friends to sign up or to yeah, to sign up for a club just to vote view. And that's like. 45 00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.400 Jenny Duan: so dumb. 46 00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.260 huda: Yeah. 47 00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:35.999 Jenny Duan: wow. Well, I'm sorry that you had to experience that. That sounds really frustrating, and I feel like you've done a really good job of handling the situation, and, you know, seeking out teachers to go reach out to. Because I think sorry. Let me turn off this way. I think you should definitely be advocating for yourself in this type of situation, because. 48 00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:44.479 Jenny Duan: again, like it has nothing. This has nothing to do with you or your behavior anything. It's 100% about their actions and 49 00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:52.130 Jenny Duan: honestly, like their lack of judgment here, you know. So that's super super frustrating. 50 00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.630 Jenny Duan: and okay. 51 00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.749 Jenny Duan: what about any updates on your game. 52 00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:11.669 huda: okay. So I didn't have much time to work on the game this week. Because I was kind of trying to focus more on 53 00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.670 huda: I guess the website cause. 54 00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:26.480 huda: I want to get that up and running, you know, like, just a little bit. Oh, yeah, also for folklift. I got another interview like a planned so 55 00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:39.769 huda: this week, or I guess next. No, this week. I think on Thursday we're gonna meet and film. And we are like preparing with script right now. So yeah, 56 00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:58.740 huda: Did you finish filming the first interview? What's the status on that the first one. Actually I wouldn't. I don't think we actually got to film because she like the day that we're supposed to film. She flaked out, and then I said, like, can we reschedule? She hasn't replied yet, but 57 00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.809 huda: when you send a follow up to the first person 58 00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:22.229 Jenny Duan: and it's okay, because honestly, like this happens all the time, like people sign up. Then they play. But sometimes you just have to keep bothering them until they eventually respond. And this is always the case like for me when I have to deal with you know my schools. It, for example. 59 00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.430 Jenny Duan: I have to send them like 5 messages, and like, respond really remind them like every 3 days, or else they'll just ignore me. So probably same situation. 60 00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.130 huda: Yes. 61 00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.240 huda: Oh, yeah, the game. I'd say, like 62 00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.380 huda: one thing that I got running was 63 00:12:47.580 --> 00:13:08.440 huda: I started trying to start from like the beginning of the game. So like. You know how sometimes like games is like a chronological like order. I tried like going from the very beginning, like when you first open the game. This scene will play out. So I'm gonna try to give like the context of the game. I started working on that scene. 64 00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:15.190 huda: and kind of like before the whole like robot rogue situation happens. So it's like the exposition. 65 00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:23.010 huda: I think also, I definitely work more on the game this week. I think I wanna try. 66 00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:31.739 huda: I mean, like I want. I don't have like a specific goal in mind. But I think I want to try like doing more dialog cause I'm having like a difficult time 67 00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.940 huda: with actually no, I'm more of a difficult time of the art for the game. So 68 00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:46.220 huda: I don't know. I think I might have to ask someone for help with that, because I'm not like I'm more of the developer side of game development. So 69 00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.180 huda: yeah. 70 00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.430 Jenny Duan: got it? 71 00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.870 Jenny Duan: And then. 72 00:13:53.460 --> 00:14:01.649 Jenny Duan: okay. And then I think there's one other thing with the game like, have you been able to film any more video tutorials. 73 00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:19.920 huda: No, but I have, like I have one in mind. I think I wrote a script for it. A few days ago. So I think I can probably film it pretty soon. I think I was gonna do a tutorial on like how to do animations within. Unity. 74 00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:27.610 Jenny Duan: yeah, that that totally makes sense. And then, how's the SAT studying going? 75 00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:45.719 huda: I will say, able to take an sat practice test today or this weekend, because I had like a birthday party. Oh, yeah, I think your dad, Sarge mentioned that. How did that go? Happy? Belated birthday. Thank you. It was. It was really fun. I have like all my friends over, and I was like, really nice. 76 00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.259 Jenny Duan: Yay, well, I'm super happy you got to celebrate with your friends, and 77 00:14:50.280 --> 00:15:00.739 Jenny Duan: I'm really happy that, like you have a good group of people who are supportive, because, you know, among all the toxic people in the world really nice to have, like a small group of people who can really count on. 78 00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.430 huda: Yeah, for sure. 79 00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:29.329 huda: Well, other than that sat. I've just been like throughout the week I've been the math document that you sent I've been trying to like. Read over some of the like the formulas that I need. And I've been like setting up, like, you know. Sometimes you have, like the Youtube videos where they'll be like, set up your graph and calculator this way to like help you during the sat. I think you're cutting out. 80 00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.470 Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry you just cut out. Can you repeat what you said? I think you said but can you? 81 00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:50.960 huda: Yeah. So and on Youtube, they have like these like videos which are like, set up your graphing calculator this way so that you can use it. During the sat. So I was starting to like, set up my graphic calculator so it could be helpful during the math section. 82 00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.670 Jenny Duan: Awesome sounds great. 83 00:15:53.890 --> 00:16:08.220 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is all really good. I thought we could do like a broad kind of check in on general progress. And I'm gonna open up our track record really quickly to just take a look at that. 84 00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.249 Jenny Duan: One moment. 85 00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.990 Jenny Duan: Okay. 86 00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.520 Jenny Duan: so okay. So I think. 87 00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.190 Jenny Duan: right here with the SAT, and the PSAT. Is that coming up for your school. 88 00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:30.690 huda: Do you have a date? Let me just check the actual date. Okay. 89 00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.850 huda: it's on October fourteenth. 90 00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that gives us about 91 00:16:54.020 --> 00:17:04.229 Jenny Duan: 3 weeks to to kind of like, prepare for the PSAT. So one thing that I really want to highlight this week is, I want you to take a 92 00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:18.629 Jenny Duan: Psat practice test. I think this question about I have a question about the Psat practice test. So on a college board website they have like one. And then they have like 93 00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:27.620 huda: on that like, Pdf, there's like modules. And I don't. I'm not sure like how to take the test, cause 94 00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.680 huda: I think the like. I think the timings don't really make sense to me. So 95 00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.330 Jenny Duan: let's just take a look. 96 00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.120 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's take the full length. PS. 18. Non-adaptive. 97 00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.370 Jenny Duan: Oh, I didn't. 98 00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.950 Jenny Duan: Did they move it to online this year? 99 00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.390 Jenny Duan: Do you know if the PSAT. This year's on line. 100 00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.080 Yeah, it is 101 00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.310 Jenny Duan: okay. 102 00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.539 Jenny Duan: So online, pst, and Ms, qt, 103 00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:12.660 Jenny Duan: okay. sign into my practice. And 104 00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.170 yeah. 105 00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.130 Jenny Duan: I think in the in the in 2024, I think it's 106 00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:31.169 Jenny Duan: I mean in 23. I think it's still in purse. I mean, it's still on paper. Is your school doing it online? 107 00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.940 huda: Yeah, we're doing it online on. yeah. 108 00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.980 Jenny Duan: okay. 109 00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.480 Jenny Duan: like. 110 00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.969 Jenny Duan: okay, let's see, practice first on line. 111 00:18:50.920 --> 00:19:02.949 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, so they just recommend taking the digital SAT. So why don't you just do the PSAT. Practice test the full length imp on paper, but 112 00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:15.509 Jenny Duan: the non adaptive. But just do it online. So instead of printing it out, how you normally do just do it like on your screen and look at a computer and then write the answers down on a piece of paper. 113 00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.029 Jenny Duan: is that okay with you? 114 00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.419 huda: Yeah, that makes sense. So I think. 115 00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.529 Jenny Duan: go ahead. 116 00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.099 huda: Yeah, can you like, show me like, how I can take the test? Cause? It's a bit confusing. 117 00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:36.459 Jenny Duan: Yeah, of course. So it's so much. Oh, yeah, I see what you mean by the modules. So the module, or just each section, for example, like reading, is a section. Reading 118 00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:43.160 Jenny Duan: a module. 2. Okay. 119 00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:49.609 Jenny Duan: So you're only gonna take one of the module ones you don't have to. 120 00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.920 Jenny Duan: take. Actually, I think you okay, actually, never mind. So think what you're gonna do with this is 121 00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.750 Jenny Duan: You're going to to take 39 min for the first module. 122 00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:29.229 Jenny Duan: The 39 min for the second module, 43 min for the math. Module one and 43 m minutes minutes for the math. Module 2. So set the timer and do the first section 39 min. Stop, take the second module 39 min, stop, take a 10 min, break, then to the first math module, 43 min, stop, and then 43 min for the second math module and stop. So you're gonna be taking 2 reading sections, then 2 math sections. 123 00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.410 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? 124 00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:37.690 huda: Is that is it going to be like the on the actual test or I believe. So, yeah, okay. 125 00:20:37.990 --> 00:21:07.630 Jenny Duan: but I think there, it's gonna be online. So I think what is probably gonna happen is like you're get for reading. You're gonna get one passage, and then you're gonna get a set of like 10 questions. Once you go to the next passage. I don't think you'll be able to click back, so I think you'll be able to click the answers like on your screen, and then I don't think you'll be able to go back after you finish each module or not after you finish module after you finish each passage for the reading section. And then for the math section, I don't think you'll be able to go back 126 00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.540 Jenny Duan: for the math questions. Hi, there! 127 00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.119 huda: Oh, okay, that's 128 00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.110 huda: that's different. Right? Yeah. 129 00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.000 Jenny Duan: I'm pretty sure that's how it's gonna go. 130 00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.590 Jenny Duan: let me actually confirm right now. So 131 00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.929 Jenny Duan: new changes. 132 00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.150 Jenny Duan: Psit again. 133 00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 134 00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:51.669 Jenny Duan: the PSAT is gonna be digital and See? It'll be shorter, and it'll have 2 sections. 135 00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.670 Jenny Duan: see? 136 00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.880 Jenny Duan: Belfry. 137 00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.230 Jenny Duan: Well. 138 00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.190 Jenny Duan: okay, yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure that that's just gonna 139 00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:33.679 Jenny Duan: I'm pretty sure that's gonna be how it's administered. But I don't have a confirmation. But other college board testing like the Ap. Tests when they were administered online, you couldn't go back. So that's why I assume that the these tests you won't be able to go back either. 140 00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:40.979 Yeah, hopefully, like. that's something that really different from the actual license fee. So 141 00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:51.460 Jenny Duan: yeah, that's why it's good that you're taking the SAT. Soon. That way, you can take the paper SAT, and not the digital SAT, because that's like a whole different ballpark. 142 00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.310 Jenny Duan: And 143 00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.169 huda: okay, but does it make sense how you're gonna do the PC T test this week. 144 00:22:58.330 --> 00:22:59.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 145 00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:09.340 Jenny Duan: So here are other goals. Video game project where? Okay? So we're not done with the game yet. It's week 8. And again I feel like 146 00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:18.320 Jenny Duan: A game takes a lot of time. And obviously I'm not trying to rush anything. What do you think is a good timeline for? You like finishing the game 147 00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.969 huda: honestly? I don't know. Like 148 00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.380 huda: if I could finish it that soon. So I'd say, like I'd give myself 149 00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.509 huda: like, how how much time maximum do I have cause like 150 00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:42.599 huda: I mean, you don't have that. There is no maximum time done before I applied for like the summer 151 00:23:42.970 --> 00:24:05.259 Jenny Duan: summer programs or time. I think the biggest thing actually is not about developing the game. It's about sharing your story with the game. I think that's the biggest thing like trying to build your digital presence and trying to get pr opportunities for yourself. So trying to have people notice your work, I think that is more important to me than finishing the game itself. 152 00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.710 Jenny Duan: So once you have, like a sample version that you that you're proud of, that you can like take screenshots from or take clips from. I think 153 00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.270 Jenny Duan: that's like more important. 154 00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.770 huda: Yeah. So I'd give myself like, maybe 155 00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:33.169 huda: maybe like 5 weeks, maybe like I don't know if it's too much. But like I wanna give myself like enough time to 156 00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:40.739 huda: like make it well, and also like I was wondering if you had any more like tips, for, like 157 00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:46.450 huda: posted like my journey for game development, because I find like hard and 158 00:24:46.650 --> 00:25:02.150 huda: I find it like what I'm it kind of discourages me from like, actually making the game, because, like they're not to get out the screen recorded. And then like, it's like a whole process like, Do you have any tips like on how to make 159 00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:07.460 huda: like game dev logs. Or I'll just kind of be more consistent online. 160 00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.679 Yeah, I think, just like. 161 00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:20.050 Jenny Duan: I mean, you don't always have to post like what you are working on. You can also, if you're comfortable with post stuff from your live and also creating like a content schedule 162 00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:30.479 Jenny Duan: is, you know, a good idea. Like, for example, like saying, like, Okay, I want to post this content on this day and like playing that out ahead of time would be 163 00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.259 Jenny Duan: like one way that you can showcase your growth. 164 00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.850 Jenny Duan: Also like, let me, just right now, I'm gonna try to find an example of 165 00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.470 Jenny Duan: someone's social media. 166 00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.830 Jenny Duan: So let's see. 167 00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.190 Jenny Duan: And 168 00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:57.629 Jenny Duan: I'm trying to find, like an example of something to show you. So you can see what another game developing 169 00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:10.119 Jenny Duan: professional social media looks like. But I think just like trying to make it more. Something that's fun for you like it, doesn't. It shouldn't have to be boring for you. 170 00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.510 Jenny Duan: this is one example. So this is like a game. 171 00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:23.390 Jenny Duan: it's, you know, going to be releasing on stream steam. Sorry it has 57,000 followers. 172 00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.619 Jenny Duan: and it just has, like little clips from the 173 00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:40.089 Jenny Duan: from the game. But you can just have these little clips and write a caption, too, like you can just walk through a scene. For example, like learning machine learning, you can just have like a couple photos or 174 00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.959 Jenny Duan: a brief clip like 5 s from your game, and just put a caption over it. 175 00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:55.679 Jenny Duan: That's one way. If you want to feature more of yourself. let's see. Oh, here's another example. This is someone set up. 176 00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.280 Jenny Duan: This is a pretty cool example. Post. 177 00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.670 Jenny Duan: this is like someone talking about their game. 178 00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.820 Jenny Duan: I think you can do stuff like that, too. 179 00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.599 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? 180 00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.919 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then empowering aid. 181 00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.720 huda: I think you can cut out 182 00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:33.550 Jenny Duan: well, so far. Do you have a ligands list for a oh, sorry. Do you have like an attendance list? Or do you have like a like a group of people who have signed up already. 183 00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:52.099 huda: No, not yet, cause I think. We're trying to get at least like 2 slideshows done before then, because we wanna make sure like the deadline is like solid. But maybe you could have like an interest form. And anyone in the interest form we can like. Add them to the sign up, maybe. 184 00:27:52.850 --> 00:28:00.540 Jenny Duan: that might be. That's that's that's like a good idea. Let me just put that on the list. Okay. 185 00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.720 Jenny Duan: interest on for empowering AI workshop. 186 00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:15.509 Jenny Duan: and then let's continue on the rest of the progress check. 187 00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.579 Jenny Duan: The videos, I think. 188 00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.200 Jenny Duan: And 189 00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.920 Jenny Duan: how is that going? Like the Youtube channel? 190 00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:31.310 huda: So so far, I have like one video or about game to film, at least. 191 00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:56.780 huda: I think, yeah, I should definitely put a lot more effort into like the game. And like Youtube, I find, like, it's just like kind of time consuming, which is like what kind of discourages need. But I think I should like definitely cut down on the time. For like development and such for, like. The website. I think I should like kind of allocate that more towards like the Youtube, video. 192 00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:04.229 huda: yeah, I think it has something that's enjoyable for you, because, again, if you don't enjoy that, then I don't think 193 00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:20.350 Jenny Duan: like at the end of the day it should be something that you personally find meaningful. And all of these suggestions. I tell you they're just my suggestions. But you don't have to do something, just, you know, because I'm saying so, cause I think it should still be like something that you think is worth your time. So is this something that you still think is interesting? 194 00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:28.499 huda: I like, okay, I think it's interesting. But I just, I feel like it's not something that 195 00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.119 huda: I feel like motivated to do sometimes, cause I feel like 196 00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.840 huda: I'm not able to like make it, because, like, then, I have to like 197 00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.100 huda: set up a bunch of things, and I feel like just making the game 198 00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:52.680 huda: itself like. And I think I would post on social media and make some Youtube videos. But I just don't think I would make like videos outside of devlogs. I feel 199 00:29:53.090 --> 00:30:02.280 Jenny Duan: gotcha gotcha. So you know, there's other ways. We can get publicity for your game besides doing social media like if social media is not something that you want to do like. 200 00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:14.989 Jenny Duan: Why don't we try to do? How do you feel about for example being featured in newsletters or being on a podcast is that something that you would want to do? Yeah, definitely. Cause yeah, I think there's still, other ways for you to get 201 00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.389 Jenny Duan: more publicity without 202 00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:47.020 Jenny Duan: the content yourself. So this week, maybe one thing we can do is identify. I think I'm gonna put this on hold. I don't think it's we should do it this week because I really wanna focus. And I wanna spend the last couple of minutes here after we finish talking about this on your Ncw. Application cause I think you know that's important. I don't wanna forget that. But I think in the future, like next week we could talk about 203 00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.379 Jenny Duan: reaching out to podcasts newsletters and pitching yourself. 204 00:30:52.880 --> 00:31:04.039 Jenny Duan: Because then, you know, like, instead of writing your own blog, you can just like do an interview with another newsletter, and they can feature your work, and that's also a good way for other people to know about you, too. 205 00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:12.650 Jenny Duan: And so I think. But I do think with the social media, I think it's maybe important to have, like a minimum of say, like 206 00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:34.610 Jenny Duan: one post, or at least a bio that way. When you do a newsletter, they can like link to your website, or they can link to you in some way. So people can follow you. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to be super active if you don't want to be. But there should still be a way for people to like connect to you to reach out to you if they want to say, feature your game somewhere or give you more opportunities. Does that make sense? 207 00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.110 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Sounds good. 208 00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.529 Jenny Duan: So the last thing that I wanted to check in on progress wise is forklift. 209 00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:57.830 Jenny Duan: So I know that our goal was to get 3 videos done. How is that going? I know you have. You have the first person flaked, but we're gonna follow up on them. That's okay. And then the second person is confirmed. 210 00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:09.489 huda: Yeah. And then a meeting up with someone on Tuesday, or like on call. And then we're setting a date for their phone session. It's like a clothing brand. 211 00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.969 huda: and they're pretty like 212 00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.290 huda: like I'd say 213 00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:21.640 huda: enthusiastic about about it. They're really looking forward to it. So, yeah. 214 00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.459 Jenny Duan: yeah. And are you excited to do that? Fran? 215 00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:39.340 huda: Yeah, for sure. I think like the one that I've confirmed this week in the filling session. I think I'm really excited about it, because it's like a it's like a match making business and like, Oh, that's exciting ideas. For like the commercials. So, yeah. 216 00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.800 Jenny Duan: awesome. And did you like, did you reach out to them, or did they reach out to you? Or how did they find you? 217 00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:54.540 huda: Ii found them through the Facebook post, yeah, and like local as well and also like 218 00:32:54.730 --> 00:33:13.270 huda: she asked me if I can like continue making videos for her like, I don't know. I think every person I've asked like keeps asking me if I can make multiple videos with them. So like, I think I'm gonna follow up with that offer. Because, like, you know, the more videos I get is like, probably the better. So yeah. 219 00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.210 Jenny Duan: awesome. 220 00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:26.849 Jenny Duan: You're. I think that progress wise, I think. Direction. Because what we what we're focusing on. Oh, sorry. Can you hear me? 221 00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.120 huda: Oh, yeah, hear me. 222 00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.909 Jenny Duan: Okay. Awesome. 223 00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:58.980 Jenny Duan: I think that in the big picture wise, I think what we're really trying to focus on is, first of all, starting more service projects. Because that was one thing that we identified. We're missing. And then also like holding in on your academics. So your sat psat your grades really excited to see your progress with the community college class. That's super exciting. And bringing that aspect up. And then finally, like doing some more work in the Cs field, which is what we're doing with empowering 224 00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:13.300 Jenny Duan: forklift, giving you some more web development. Experience. So big picture overview. That's kind of what we're working towards and really rounding out your profile to prepare you for, like Cs adjacent majors at top schools. 225 00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:26.960 Jenny Duan: That being said, I wanna transition back into the awards thing that we were working on earlier. So the Nc. It award I saw that you put in more drafts. Will you walk me through the changes that you've made this week? 226 00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:42.149 huda: So I kinda I started making the second draft one. I feel like the first sentence is kinda like an unread thought, but like unfinished thought. But like the first paragraph is kinda like 227 00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:53.630 huda: we like brainstorming. I got a little busy, like homework and stuff. I tried like working on the essays, but I wasn't able to finish them. But 228 00:34:53.790 --> 00:35:09.989 huda: yeah, I was like kind of talking about like what I saw as like a young kid like what I imagined cause I always imagined myself like working with computers as a kid. And I kinda like emphasize that. And 229 00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:32.220 huda: I tried like mentioning like the things like we talked about last week. About like wanting to study Cs in college and doing the projects and stuff. And I feel like like the way I put it, just kind of feels to force. So I'm not really happy with the way I wrote it. But yeah, so 230 00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:37.850 Jenny Duan: how would you write it if you feel like, how would you tell your story if it didn't feel forced. 231 00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:44.079 Jenny Duan: Let me just okay. Let's just forget about the writing. I'm going to ask you this question. I want you to just talk to me 232 00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:52.410 Jenny Duan: like, don't don't worry about writing any of this down. I'll take notes. Describe how technology may play a central role as you imagine your future. 233 00:35:53.690 --> 00:36:21.880 huda: What kind of like? Okay, what I'm saying in the paragraph is honest, but just sounds force, even though it isn't. But like I honestly did see myself like working with other people, and like I guess I had some vision of like like me and some friends like sitting at a table, you know, working on the computer and like building robots and stuff and doing all this cool things as a as a kid. 234 00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:31.320 huda: and I just like going up. I saw that there weren't many like other people like me, like like girls. 235 00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.520 huda: really like 236 00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:37.100 huda: anyone wasn't as like motivated, and no one really 237 00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.350 huda: were in the field, and it was like not really like 238 00:36:41.200 --> 00:37:03.320 huda: save space like it didn't feel like a safe space for me. And I kind of wanted to change that. And I think. now, that like I'm growing, and I'm able to do these things like, have a nonprofit do boot camps and stuff. I think that will definitely play a central role in my life in the future, like cause I wanna continue that cause. 239 00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:14.769 huda: It's not just because of academics. It's cause. I generally want to empower like younger girls. Also. Yeah, 240 00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:25.510 huda: and I just, I think. like I grew up wanting to be this way. And I wanna kind of fulfill my younger soul's dreams. 241 00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:39.279 Jenny Duan: See? That's perfect. So I think maybe what we're what you're noticing is just like the beginning. You don't feel like like this way that you're writing is authentic. Right? So 242 00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:49.030 Jenny Duan: let's describe, I think, what would be really cool. So this is the framework that I wrote down, based on what you said so like first immersing the person in the scene like 243 00:37:49.030 --> 00:38:13.069 Jenny Duan: you were saying, like heads down, like working, tinkering on a piece of code, say next to your friends, and like so first doing this imagery of the scene, and then the next sentence will be like, this is a life that you've imagined as a kid, like sitting with a bunch of other nerdy girls like working on really, really cool projects and creating something incredible, right? But then, contrasting that with, as you grew older, you realize that like this space. 244 00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:21.139 Jenny Duan: it's not a safe space, because there are really, really aggressive and frustrating people like the people who have the 245 00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:44.119 Jenny Duan: have the Hackathon Club, for example. There's people like that who try to block you out of opportunities. And you realize, like in the space, only 24% of people of game developers are female. And it's a very hard space as a young woman to like. Make your path here right? And to stand out and because you notice the struggle. As a successful game developer yourself. 246 00:38:44.120 --> 00:39:01.450 Jenny Duan: you want to change that. So now that you're older, you have a nonprofit and you know, you're doing a lot of work because you genuinely want to empower other people. And you see this playing essential role in your future beyond academics. So now, as you are looking forward. It's wanting to study computer science in college. 247 00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:14.439 Jenny Duan: You realize, like you've grown up because you've grown up this way, you, your goal is like fulfilling yourself streams, and also inspire the people that you know you work with through your nonprofit to pursue their dreams as well. 248 00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.620 huda: Yeah. 249 00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.370 Jenny Duan: like like, that's kind of a layout. 250 00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.340 huda: So 251 00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:28.099 huda: oh, go ahead. Summarizes like how I feel about it. So yeah. 252 00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.750 Jenny Duan: so I think now it just comes down to like writing this. 253 00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.110 Jenny Duan: So of it. 254 00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:48.399 Jenny Duan: What would it be? Helpful if maybe like, we started working like if we wrote the first couple of sentences together, and then maybe you can fill in the rest of the essay. Would that be good? 255 00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.500 Jenny Duan: Okay. 256 00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:55.880 Jenny Duan: So how would you? Can you describe to me that scene one more time that you're talking about here. 257 00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:22.439 huda: Kind of over here like I imagine myself like sitting at a table with a bunch of other girls like kind of like nerdy and like quiet nerdy girls sitting at a table like typing away at her computers like tinkering with robots at our table and like collaborating and having fun while doing it. 258 00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:36.019 Jenny Duan: Okay, and collaborating to solve. I'm gonna say, like. 259 00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.690 Jenny Duan: so. 260 00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.650 Jenny Duan: like some type of solve 261 00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.270 Jenny Duan: the most emergent problems. 262 00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.219 Jenny Duan: I think we can change that language. 263 00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.500 huda: But let me just write that down. For now. 264 00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.660 Jenny Duan: integrate and 265 00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:04.670 Jenny Duan: okay, can you put me in that scene like. 266 00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:12.449 Jenny Duan: Don't put yourself in it. Don't say like I'm sitting here. Put me in it like what does? What are you seeing? What are you touching like 267 00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:25.199 Jenny Duan: involve the senses? I wanna I wanna like, feel like I'm watching that the scene from a movie like you like movies, you like film. Right? You're really good at making videos, say, like as a director, what are you putting in this scene? 268 00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:44.299 huda: Okay? So in the background, like, you can see people like talking, and you know, just like there'll be like a crowd and like it'll be a lot of people. But the people that stand out to. You are like this group of girls that are that are like, I guess. 269 00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.840 huda: like figuratively like kinda like like 270 00:41:48.870 --> 00:42:07.449 huda: very happy and like vibrant and like, cause they're very happy at what they do. So you'd have like them talking, and you like hear them, and they're like conversations. Try and get at a problem, and like helping each other with like little parts of the code and 271 00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.869 huda: and like maybe to frame it like 272 00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.480 huda: in a director kind of way. I'd say. 273 00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:24.099 huda: like, I just like, wanna emphasize that they like probably stand out like a lot from everyone else. I don't know how to like word it, though. 274 00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.530 huda: I'd say. 275 00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.359 huda: like, okay. So maybe like some like how in different they are. 276 00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:48.050 huda: maybe we could talk about like how everyone's like laughing and like not really paying attention to their surroundings. But this, like this group, is like attentive to their like, their goals, maybe like, which is the computer 277 00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.770 Jenny Duan: of code. 278 00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.399 Jenny Duan: the feel, how, how, what is the feeling. 279 00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:12.389 huda: the feeling of like satisfaction, as I guess we probably debug the code, maybe 280 00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.870 Jenny Duan: feeling of satisfaction. And 281 00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:34.320 Jenny Duan: okay, this is like a beginning. You know, it's a rough draft. We can edit it. But 282 00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:58.029 Jenny Duan: this is what I put down to start. The sound of laughter and the cooking of laptop keys fills the space. I pointed the screen next to mine, identifying a bug in a line of code. The feeling of collaboration and satisfaction lights up the room. This was the life I imagined as a kid sitting at a table surrounded by girls like me typing away at lines of code, chinking with robots and collaborating to solve the most emergent problems. 283 00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.400 Jenny Duan: How does that sound? For like an opening 284 00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.950 huda: sounds amazing. 285 00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Now. 286 00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:12.629 Jenny Duan: it's up to you to finish the rest. I know that you can do it. And again, we already have the the outline done. 287 00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:35.889 Jenny Duan: Now, all you need to do is just fill it in like. However, as I got older, you realize it's not a safe space. You learn that only 24% of people are female anyways, the outlines here. This is. These are all the points that we wanted to put in. That we talked about last time. So I think, being able to get a draft of this essay again, it's only 250 words. It's not a long essay. That's why, like 288 00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:46.279 Jenny Duan: every sent, every like little paragraph, should have only like a couple of sentences, because 250 words is really not a lot like we talked about this. This was 250 words. Right? 289 00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:56.169 Jenny Duan: This is not a lot of text at all. So same thing here, not a lot of writing. Just get the ideas down and we can revise polish. Don't worry about it being perfect. 290 00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.790 huda: Okay, thank you. 291 00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:05.799 Ivy Mentors: This is amazing. Actually have it. I'm glad that I joined. Sorry I was a bit late, but just loved the the way 292 00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:23.620 Ivy Mentors: you just structured this. Thanks, Jenny, I think, taking her through like the immersive and the contrasting part, I think there's so much learning for everyone here. But also, I think. I know we are top of the hour, I mean, I actually you know, this is kind of a good revelation for me as well 293 00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:35.390 Ivy Mentors: as we have been discussing a few times, and I shared with you, I think. Since the time that lucky day when you kind of took over the the mentorship for Houdini. And really fortunate for that. 294 00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:54.249 Ivy Mentors: You know, initially, like our thinking and my understanding was really about hey? You know, just the checklist. hey? You know she's she's doing her academics. Let her get some good, sat scores and psat, and and and I knew that we have passion projects was a huge thing, and that's why she had actually started with Janice as well. 295 00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:12.120 Ivy Mentors: But then the whole understanding around, like, you know, hey, this is like a big holistic kind of evaluation or a game, you know, at the end of the day, very strategic in nature everything has to be taken care of, and students need to work on everything was a good learning experience. 296 00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:30.649 Ivy Mentors: And I think the key, and also like you know, you know, thanks to you, I being we've also like kind of learned on how multiple things need to be weave together right? Just to kind of stand out eventually. Regardless of whichever top school you're talking about. 297 00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:38.749 Ivy Mentors: One is your kind of your aptitude, and that's clearly like I'm I'm kind of reiterating what I've learned, and and also for HUD to be on the same page 298 00:46:38.910 --> 00:47:08.230 Ivy Mentors: is like, Okay, computer science, clearly like, you know, is her aptitude as well regardless. And it's good to know independently, like, you know. Hear her say that story like it's it's very reaffirming that you know she is not forcefully trying to create something, but it's very generally and authentically coming from her, which is great. Then second, was also her passion something that I completely know as a parent like, you know. With my biases and background pretty much. Saw that as as a distraction for my older daughter, and also for for Houda. 299 00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:15.800 and II stand reformed and corrected today as a parent like, you know, her video skills and videography is amazing. 300 00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:25.150 Ivy Mentors: And then, of course, like, you know, the community impact aspect like again, these are the kind of 3 things that I've taken away and learned over the months that we have worked together. 301 00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:36.220 Ivy Mentors: Now the thing so, and and and you very, you know, strategically and and very tactically put an entire roadmap for Huda here, which is great 302 00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.420 Ivy Mentors: now. 303 00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:41.719 Ivy Mentors: I think the the real kind of exploration that 304 00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:53.050 Ivy Mentors: I've also been doing with Hoda and Huda's been doing herself is like, how do we like weave that profile? Right? And it became evident that video skills are critically important because that's her passion. 305 00:47:53.080 --> 00:48:02.229 Ivy Mentors: And then like aptitude. But I think what I mean. This is kind. It was a very re, you know, very enlightening kind of last 15 min for me. 306 00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.180 Ivy Mentors: where I also feel like Huta is a gimmer at her heart, right? 307 00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:22.280 Ivy Mentors: Which which which I know that I've I've seen her like, you know, who does like one of those gaming you know, and I don't know how like a lot of Asian parents take it like, you know, cutthroat like, at least in my experience, not something that we truly value like. At least I didn't value a lot. 308 00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:28.369 Ivy Mentors: But that's really something that she's so so passionate about like this whole kind of immersive experience, she explained. I never knew about it. 309 00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:36.649 Ivy Mentors: and also like, when I start connecting dots. Now I see that that's what she's been doing like throughout developing games, developing games, developing games. 310 00:48:36.850 --> 00:49:00.600 Ivy Mentors: So and and then the whole story around game developer. And and you brought out that 24% on a female. And then the whole kind of struggles that who guys going through in her kind of school high school as as a you know, in in a voice club being like, you know, one of the few girls who are actually pursuing this. It kind of makes me rethink, then, isn't isn't that kind of a true passion like being a game developer? 311 00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:06.360 Ivy Mentors: And I think, you know, there can be multiple passions. The reason why I'm bringing this up again is 312 00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:19.220 Ivy Mentors: number one, like, you know, with, based on the experiences that happened last week for Huda. I wanted Houda also kind of Houda and me to kind of further kind of understand. Why are we doing certain things right? 313 00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:35.579 Ivy Mentors: I think what is important. And and I think she's on a a good track. But why is also critically important? And because I don't want without to feel like, you know, every lot of people around her are checking, taking lot of boxes right? So I had a a kind of 314 00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:55.649 Ivy Mentors: you know, a session with whoever I was trying to understand. Why does she feel she cannot do it? She cannot get, and lot of her answers went around. Oh, I haven't ticked this box. I haven't ticked that box right? I don't. I have a be in one of my grades. And then oh, I have nothing to show from a community perspective, you know, from my kind of local community I can show nothing. 315 00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:01.459 Ivy Mentors: And she would tell that. Oh, I think that guy will get into Berkeley. I think this girl will get into Brown 316 00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:13.859 Ivy Mentors: so like, you know, she has this feeling, even though I don't think there's a significant difference like in my understanding. But then I would ask like, Why do you think this person would make it okay? Because her dad actually studied in brown? 317 00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:29.030 Ivy Mentors: And you know the. And and then he would. She would say that, oh, because this guy is actually raising funds like her neighbor, he's actually raising a lot of funds and you know, he seems to be like making a lot of. So I think some ways I feel like every student has this thing. Where 318 00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:34.999 Ivy Mentors: in the peer pressure. They feel like they are not doing enough, and they just want to tick all the boxes. 319 00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:42.729 Ivy Mentors: But what I want here is to really like kind of revisit the whole roadmap and strategy that you made. 320 00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:58.969 Ivy Mentors: and for HUD to know that at the end of the day there is a certain kind of strategic plan and focus that she has, like you are guiding her with. And it's okay. If she's not doing like raising funds, it's okay. If she's not being a part of this Msa. Club because of whatever politics. 321 00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:01.719 Ivy Mentors: But still there is a game plan. 322 00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:09.600 Ivy Mentors: and I think one of the things that I would also love to bring some focus on is like, you know, if she really wants to go deep on game development. 323 00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:17.920 Ivy Mentors: right? I'm more than happy to kind of work on that kind of, you know. Explore that path right? Any college, you know, that is like a top college for game developers. 324 00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:40.880 Ivy Mentors: I, you know, or a very interdisciplinary program, right? Like, I know that. Who that wants to do? Cs, but I feel like her passions are still like, you know, the the manifestation of those skills is still a game developer. The manifestation of or her kind of video skills is also, like, you know, making, like, you know, creative as you rightly said, she wants to create things. She wants to empower people 325 00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:58.849 Ivy Mentors: so sorry it's it's fully loaded. But I think in in some ways right. You know I would love to pick your thoughts on. How do you think we should further like strategize? So that who that is more clear on, on. You know the college she's applying to, or the program she is really pursuing, because I still feel that clarity is not there yet. Right? 326 00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.130 Jenny Duan: Sorry. 327 00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.369 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, totally makes sense. 328 00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:10.429 Jenny Duan: So, Huda, I know that we've talked about a lot of alternatives to computer science and computer science in general, I think it'd be really 329 00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:28.089 Jenny Duan: pool again to do computer science. But at some schools they might have computer game design concentrations or game development concentrations. Now, how do you feel about game design as your career path is this, you know what you want to do the most? Or are you still exploring within computer science. 330 00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:56.109 huda: Yeah, definitely, I think Usc actually has a game development program. And that's something like, I think, like, instead of applying for film, I think I'd much rather like, apply for game development, because that's something that wanna like way more in like experience with and like to. Also, it's not as competitive like, I mean, it's still competitive, but like in comparison to like Usc, like film, it's definitely less competitive. 331 00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:01.040 Jenny Duan: Totally yeah. I think you University. 332 00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:21.349 Jenny Duan: U. Usc. Has a game development program. Same with Ucsc, University of California. Santa Cruz also has a game development program which is pretty cool. I think they're the. They're the first Ucsc is the first Uc school to launch an undergrad game development program. 333 00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:34.170 Jenny Duan: So that's pretty cool. It's also local. So I'm wondering if they have any like high school opportunities. This is something that I can look into after this and see, because if Ucse has a couple of high school like programs. 334 00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:54.220 Jenny Duan: That'd be something you can look into, or even taking a class there like in the summer, or something given that, you know, it's super close to you. That could be really cool. Also, I think Cmu has a game development program. I believe. They have a game designer which is really cool. 335 00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.280 Jenny Duan: I think Georgia Tech has 336 00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:04.210 Jenny Duan: they have, like digital and computational media, which is pretty similar to game design. NYU, has game design. 337 00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:09.720 Ivy Mentors: okay. So 338 00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:34.340 Jenny Duan: who has mit has something called comparative media studies which might be interesting to you? Comparative media studies has a concentration in games and interactive media. So like comparative media studies might be interesting if you're interested in like studying, combining film and Cs and studying like media through a lens of like both development, uiux film 339 00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:38.770 Jenny Duan: and games that that might be a good fit at mit 340 00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.839 huda: to combine like game development and film. 341 00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:45.570 huda: I'd be really interested 342 00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.670 Ivy Mentors: yeah, let me just send you some more information on that 343 00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:56.769 Ivy Mentors: I think the good thing, however, is that, like whatever she is focused on, I think you very beautifully articulated again, like, you know, in terms of 344 00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:24.409 Ivy Mentors: Cs, and then community. And then her academics. I think it. It can be re purpose right. And we've together in in kind of so I think that's a good thing, right? It won't be like significantly. She won't be like pivoting correct like if she decides to do something. I think what she's doing. We're putting her on the track to study exactly what she wants to do, because, like ha! Let's think about how our film and how our Cs connected. It's all about creating something. 345 00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:33.739 Jenny Duan: And same with building community like, you're creating something for other people to improve their lives. That's basically at the heart of what you do, whether that's you know what? Depending on. 346 00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:46.730 Jenny Duan: regardless of the medium you're choosing. Film CS. Non profit work. What you're doing is you're creating something to improve someone's life. And you're telling a story in multiple, different ways. And I think that's like 347 00:55:46.800 --> 00:56:00.920 Jenny Duan: that's at the heart of what you do. And as long as we're able to stick with that theme in all of your extracurriculars like they all connect, and there's no need to pivot, because, you know, at the end of the day, like everything that you're doing is already putting you on that path towards where you want to be. 348 00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:06.760 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. I think that last. I think you also really brought that clarity. Thanks so much, Jenny, because 349 00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:15.049 Ivy Mentors: you basically said that these are all mediums. I think we have to clearly like, you know, I think this is where? You know, it's very hard to kind of separate these 2 350 00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:32.570 Ivy Mentors: at the end of the day. What do you want to be? Your path. To what do you want to be right like that is really your authentic self, your story. And that's where you're gonna succeed. And Co. Contrib to the community or the world. Right? I think you've you. And I think this is where a lot of things go wrong, because 351 00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:46.549 Ivy Mentors: people clearly like start associating the medium with the goal. Right? It's like, Oh, Cs, I want to be a developer. The only way forward for me. And I think that really comes, unfortunately, also through various ignorance, right? Because that's how we grew up coming from our backgrounds. 352 00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.249 Ivy Mentors: So I love it like, for example, I'll be very honest like. 353 00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:59.160 Ivy Mentors: I have really come to appreciate like symbolic systems. You know, like, you are symbolic system in Stanford, and nude is also symbolic system. 354 00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:17.570 Ivy Mentors: I think new, you know, is is kind of she's in neuroscience and computer science, some kind of other mix right? And then you have psychology. And so these are like, you know, I would love with that for you to like, you know. Jenny, is already giving so much. I think she's gonna guide you, but I think I would love you to kind of really go deep 355 00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:27.730 Ivy Mentors: search like, you know, what are the programs that excite you? And whatever you're working. The good thing is that you've gone. You've done a very. You've given the first principle components to do that. 356 00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:33.990 Ivy Mentors: that she has those components that. Can we then be weaved into whatever she wants to get in so 357 00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:41.020 Ivy Mentors: great? So yeah, that you don't have to worry about. If people are re raising funds, and you're not able to raise funds. 358 00:57:41.070 --> 00:58:05.390 Jenny Duan: It doesn't matter if the head of why do you need to raise funds? You're not studying business. This. Why does that matter to you? It doesn't relate to you. Other people aren't starting nonprofits right? Other people aren't making games like you don't need to worry about them. They're they're not doing what you're doing, either. There's like this guy on our street, and like he's, he's like selling like sat Prep, or something like some boot camp. Right? 359 00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:23.060 huda: I'm not sure does that matter. He's not making. He's not making films, he's not, you know. He's not making video games. He's not teaching AI classes. He's selling sat camps like anyone can sell an sat camp. But no one, not everyone can make a video right like. 360 00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:42.039 Ivy Mentors: And and this is a problem like Jenny, like throughout, you know, all the students. I know that you have a call with Anushka now. But thanks a lot. This is actually I forgot to mention anushka, actually emailed me to reschedule. So it's actually okay. I wanna spend a couple of more minutes with. And I wanted to show you this really quickly. 361 00:58:42.040 --> 00:59:08.550 Jenny Duan: This is just some inspiration. A lot of schools have similar programs, not just Mit's but this is Mit's program, just like for inspiration. Mit has a program called comparative media studies. And I just want to show you some of the classes offered through this program. Like, if you went to Mit, you could do commute comparative media studies and Cs, you could do both of them like double major minor, whatever. But here's some really cool classes that I think you might be interested in, like 362 00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:37.949 Jenny Duan: introduction to media studies, game studies. That's a class. Immersive social worlds like, how do you use like virtual reality? AR. Xr. To make social worlds designing virtual worlds? Again, how do you design, a virtual world, the art and science of time, travel, reading, climate through media, visual studies. You know, education, creating video games, creating Internet studies, games and culture fans and fan cultures, current debates in media. Cs, forward the future of K 12 Cs education. 363 00:59:38.260 --> 01:00:00.179 Jenny Duan: global Chinese cinema money as media electives, you know, advanced projects, art, culture and technology, technology and culture. The film experience, literature and film studies and film documentary acting with the camera introduction to film, you know, etcetera, what this is 364 01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:10.679 Ivy Mentors: I mean. I never thought that Mit had anything to do with liberal arts. And you know, videography and all that stuff like to be like when I think of Mit, it's just like math and science. And 365 01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:13.070 Ivy Mentors: all these temp things, you know. 366 01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:30.210 Jenny Duan: Wow, impressive. Yeah. But look at this. Look at this course. South Asian America, transnational media culture and history. That isn't that cool look, short attention span documentary. This is an MIT course like these are all you know, virtual reality and immersive media production. 367 01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:42.540 Ivy Mentors: that's all. Those are all courses at Mit. You could take. Look, I mean she's elated. I'm so excited, I mean, come on like I never thought you see the the oh, my God! Thanks, Jenny, like this is so valuable. 368 01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:55.680 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I'm just telling you, like, the world is very broad, like you, if like the classes and things that are offered to you. Not just at Mit, at other schools as well are like we can combine your in. 369 01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:18.879 Jenny Duan: There's is a space for your interest, so don't worry if you don't think it's connected because other people do like you might not think Cs and film are connected, but they definitely are like, if you just looked at these courses like virtual reality and immersive media production. That's like, you know. VR, AR. Xr, how do we create media? That can be, you know. Look, looked at. Listen to in these different forms. 370 01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:26.870 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so I think this is pretty cool. Look, does that add in development of games for learning? Isn't that basically what you're doing like games for learning. 371 01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:38.040 Ivy Mentors: There you go. Amazing, amazing, I mean, is, is this your new kind of target? I think this should be a new dream for them. 372 01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:39.100 Ivy Mentors: Sorry? 373 01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:59.170 huda: Yeah, it's like, it's such a. There's so many courses. And like, they're also interesting, like, they're all things are like, really interested in. And II didn't think that there's like even thing, even like courses that can talk about like things that are that niche. But like. 374 01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:01.200 huda: wow! It's like, so cool. 375 01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:17.230 Ivy Mentors: I mean, like, I mean, I'm just looking like, not even knowing, like just looking at these courses. I know that Hoda does these things today like this is what she does. Right? So to me, like, it's a validation that someone's like actually preparing a custom program for who that kind of a girl, you know. 376 01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:28.020 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, like, there's a space for you. Don't worry about your interest like someone else sees their Val sees this value. And look there. 377 01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:53.100 Jenny Duan: obviously, if they're going to create a whole major around a subject, that means that there's enough people to want to take that major like they're not gonna make a major for one person, right? There has to be multiple peoples enough for them to sustain faculty to open classes in this major, which means that they are taking. They're looking for people with your background. Schools like Mit are looking for people with your background. Your interest to come in and take these classes, otherwise they wouldn't have 378 01:02:53.240 --> 01:03:08.860 Jenny Duan: even offered like any of these classes. Look at how many classes there are like they have to have to sustain faculty to, you know, teach all of those classes, and to be able to do that. They have to have students like you who are interested. So there, schools like Mit are looking for people like you. 379 01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.480 huda: Rather so inspiring. Actually. 380 01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:23.969 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think so without now, you just have to get a perfect sat score. You know, it's very simple. So because Mit needs also, like good academics, right? So II think, this is amazing. 381 01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:37.679 Ivy Mentors: I I'm just wondering, like, you know, why is this thing not like you know, so easily understood. like or not accessible, or like, I would say, it's out there like, these things are all like, freely available. Right? 382 01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's just on the Internet. Yeah. 383 01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:42.940 Ivy Mentors: So I think it's really up to. Yeah. 384 01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.340 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think it's because, like 385 01:03:45.350 --> 01:04:12.870 Jenny Duan: Hood, I don't know if you experienced this, but I think, especially in the Bay area, there's this pressure to like study Cs or study engineering or like. And people like have a very narrow understanding of what CS. Is because people think like, okay, CS, you know, you're gonna go into software engineering. But in CS. Or in tech, there's so many different roles like, obviously, there's game development in game development. There are a ton of roles in game development. You know, it can be like a unity game development. 386 01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:28.090 Jenny Duan: You could be like a mobile app game developer. You could do like AR vrxr. Like all of that, is all different. And I think because people aren't aware that all these opportunities are available. It's leaves a very limited understanding of what's out there. And so people like. 387 01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:46.759 Jenny Duan: And I think also there's I don't know if you experienced this at all. But when I was applying for college. I noticed that like people kind of like, they look at the humanities. And they look like, okay, maybe this isn't as serious as Cs, and so we won't have to spend as much time on it. But in reality there's so many programs that really value the humanities that 388 01:04:46.810 --> 01:05:01.600 Jenny Duan: you know. Take the humanities and integrate them with technology like this, media studies program and turn it into something like different, but also like something in and of itself, that's really cool. And so I think because of all these factors, and I just think people like 389 01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:07.389 Jenny Duan: Don't like pay attention to this type of opportunity, even though it might be something that they might be like. 390 01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:11.919 Jenny Duan: good at or interested in, or you know, curious about, or whatever 391 01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:26.999 Ivy Mentors: absolutely. I mean, you have 5 more minutes because this is a very important point Jenni, do you? Do you have 5? So I think you're raising a very important point, and I think, 392 01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:34.629 Ivy Mentors: th. This is a problem that needs to address. And and I think the more I'm thinking about it because think about it, especially in terms of like target college. 393 01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:44.070 Ivy Mentors: And I'm actually using Anushka's example as well here. Right? So so who does a bit of like, you know? Iv mentor discussion as well. Okay, so don't be bothered. But it is relevant. 394 01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.660 Ivy Mentors: Because if you think about it right like coming back to your point. 395 01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.000 Ivy Mentors: students, parents. 396 01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:52.730 Ivy Mentors: environment. 397 01:05:53.140 --> 01:06:06.049 Ivy Mentors: everything kind of forces you to have a very narrow thinking, and people start thinking about it very binary till the kind of end, you know, and might be. Unless they experience it. And and unless someone like you explains it. 398 01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:21.589 Ivy Mentors: and especially when it comes to stem. Because if you think about stem really like, you know, Silicon Valley Bay Area is kind of the the industrial kind of output right? Of what an impact stem can have to the world technology, right. 399 01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.070 Ivy Mentors: And 400 01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:26.969 Ivy Mentors: just think about it, because I've I've seen this in multiple students now. 401 01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:39.900 Ivy Mentors: And they immediately come. And they say, What do you want to do? I want to do. Cs, I want to do this. And then why eventually they all tie up to the it all eventually lands into the outcome, which is literally getting a good job and getting good pay 402 01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.789 Ivy Mentors: period right? It all starts there. 403 01:06:42.910 --> 01:07:02.909 Ivy Mentors: So what happens is again, and I think industry is to be blamed as well, because industry, unfortunately, is being run and led by the older generation. Right? There's a gap there. It might be things that evolve where people are not catching up. So there's clearly a gap between the industry and the college academics, right? We all know that. 404 01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:24.080 Ivy Mentors: So what's happening is like Anushka. It was very interesting for her to eventually come to even cyber security right? And there's no harm in it, because her mom is a Vp of product and cyber security right? And that's what happens. Right? Doctor. Parents basically want their stood. You know, their their kids to have a future in physic become a physician. 405 01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:39.389 Ivy Mentors: See us, even though I don't say in my heart there might be like, Oh, yeah, you you should be working at Apple sometime, you know, like I want you to. And I never forced with that, by the way, right, you know. And also her older sister. She definitely didn't want to do stem, she ended up in design as an example. 406 01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:47.379 Ivy Mentors: But I think this is the problem, Jenny, what's happening is even with my older daughter right? Think about it now. Design is a big space. 407 01:07:47.630 --> 01:08:07.540 Ivy Mentors: And when you think about job opportunities, and and this is something that she started exploring because she got kind of pure design. Then she got business. And then she got in. Cal Poly. It's actually a graphic design kind of of program in Cal Poly. It is not ux design Us. Design is a part of the program, but overall, it's a very different program. 408 01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:16.109 Ivy Mentors: So Davis, on the other hand actually has a very kind of ux design kind of program, right? A Uxr kind of stuff. 409 01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:25.020 Ivy Mentors: So when she was exploding herself to decide that I was actually sitting with her, and I told her as a parent, you know what I don't like graphic design. I told her. 410 01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:42.490 Ivy Mentors: When we were exploring. I said, You know why? Because your job art opportunities are gonna be limited doesn't matter. You know what like. You can do as much ux courses inside. When you come out. When I look at as a hiring manager, I look at your profile and you tell me that you are actually a graphic designer. I'm like, okay, she's more like a graphical person. Right? I really need that 411 01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:45.699 Ivy Mentors: like human user experience designer, right? 412 01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:53.970 Ivy Mentors: And I think this is where the challenges that people are driven. And I think that needs to be solved somewhere. I think it's a bigger problem to be solved because 413 01:08:54.020 --> 01:09:03.470 Ivy Mentors: given like 5 resume is. you know, any person in the industry would actually go for that niche right like, oh, I need a Cs guy like, you know. Give me a Cs because I want a developer 414 01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:16.089 Ivy Mentors: right? Right? But there are interdisciplinary roles that are also evolving in industry. Like product management is a great example. It's one of the most interdisciplinary arts, right? And there is no program today on the face of the earth 415 01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:37.469 Ivy Mentors: from a top school that actually talks about product management. But everyone knows in the industry that the most coveted role is actually a product management role. Actually, Berkeley has a product manager. Master's program. Oh, really okay, Masters again, like an undergrad. Probably not. But it it will happen right like. So III don't know if that makes sense. But I think that's pretty much the problem. II think. 416 01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:39.060 Ivy Mentors: as 417 01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:51.720 Ivy Mentors: And I'm seeing that problem as well, right like, even in terms of trying to match mentors with like, whoever comes there always go for like, oh, I need someone with Cs, I need someone with biomed and Econ. See, this is the funny thing 418 01:09:52.050 --> 01:09:57.039 Ivy Mentors: like business has evolved so much, and people still want to go with economics. 419 01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:00.180 Ivy Mentors: Think about it like, you know, I want an e-comm grad. 420 01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:12.510 Ivy Mentors: and I'm like, you know why, Econ grad, you know, like, what is what is so like? This is about international relationships, you know. Like, why do you need an Econ grad. Oh, but that's that's kind of the fundamental business degree, you know. So 421 01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.089 Ivy Mentors: and totally, yeah. 422 01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:30.439 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think I think we need to solve this. I think, this is clearly a gap that parents and students, when they are planning their strategy and roadmap. I think college list and program list is a long process. Also, I'm I'm discovering now, right? Like, it cannot be solved like in a 423 01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:34.380 Ivy Mentors: 15 min session. You have to work, and you have to keep evolving it. Yeah. 424 01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.310 Jenny Duan: totally yeah. 425 01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:38.310 Ivy Mentors: Amazing 426 01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:41.270 Jenny Duan: cool. Who are there any more questions? 427 01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.970 huda: Not right now. But I'll let you know if I have any. 428 01:10:47.470 --> 01:11:16.680 Jenny Duan: Well, yeah. Well, I'm really excited for you. I think you know this direction that we're taking is really good. And I think if we look back like at where you were just one month, 2 months ago. I think you really grown a lot, and I would say, like, Don't be discouraged by all these people around you, because at the end of the day, like, you're doing what you're doing, they're doing what they're doing. And they're not doing what you're doing. You're not doing what they're doing. It doesn't matter what they're doing, because you're not them right like 429 01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:41.230 Jenny Duan: they're obviously they have different goals. You have your own goals. So just focus on what you're doing and tune out everything else. Because at the end of the day that doesn't impact you, you're you're the only person responsible for your own success, and you know other people's success. You can wish them well. But like at the end of the day. It's like you that you should be focused on, because the more time you spend thinking about other people, the less time you're thinking about yourself and like what you're doing. 430 01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:44.549 huda: Yeah, thank you so much. That's so encouraging. 431 01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:57.509 Jenny Duan: Yeah, of course. Well, I'm really excited to see what you're doing this week and keep me updated on how everything's going. I'd like to see hopefully, if you have time. I'd like you to finish drafting. The 432 01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.410 Jenny Duan: says essay is well, just because I do know that the deadlock 433 01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:07.719 Jenny Duan: searching, and I want to make sure that we're able to look over this and make sure that it's all set for submitting. 434 01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:09.550 huda: Okay? 435 01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:20.469 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. And yeah, I'm looking forward to actually have a meeting, you know who that we we'll also like hopefully meet you in person. On Friday we are planning a dinner, and 436 01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:29.640 Ivy Mentors: that would be awesome. Thank you very much, Jenny, and I think the the Sc. The meetings that we have skipped for. Hold. It's fine. I think we can reschedule them later. That's perfectly fine, so don't worry about them. 437 01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.899 But I think as long as she's making progress we are all good. So 438 01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:34.959 sounds good. 439 01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:38.500 Ivy Mentors: Thank you. Have a nice weekend talk to you soon. Bye, Karen.",

    "Week 3 - Coaching_Jenny_Huda_Wk03_2023-09-23_M_6a21b9fa673455efU_U_00-00-00 WEBVTT 1 00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.539 Jenny Duan: Hi, Rhoda! How's it going? 2 00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.740 huda: Hi! I'm good. How are you? 3 00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.920 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well, I just moved into my new dorm on campus, so pretty excited about that. 4 00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:55.069 Jenny Duan: But yeah, so I know that's been like about a week since we've met. So I was thinking we could probably just get into it, as I think we have a lot to cover. Today. How does that sound? 5 00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.559 huda: Okay, that sounds great. 6 00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:15.120 Jenny Duan: awesome. So yeah, I'd love to just get some general life updates. I know it's been a little bit since we've talked so I'd love to know just like what's going on. And I? I know that we've been texting a little bit back and forth. So maybe we could start with those texts and go from there. 7 00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:37.719 huda: Yeah, okay, so I think a major like Win of this week was I was able to sign up for a world history on community college. But unfortunately, it wasn't letting me like sign up for anymore. I was trying to sign up for like senior year's English, so that that way I'd take more Ap's in school. 8 00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:57.009 huda: But it was. It was like telling that the deadline was too late, even though I've been preparing since, like before, the deadline. But my counselor, she only approved it after the deadline. So that was a bit frustrating. But I found. That's that's super frustrating, especially since that's not your fault, and 9 00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:08.460 huda: like that's completely out of your control, you know, despite your efforts, yeah. And I asked her if she could do anything about it, and she said, it's not in her reach and like she can't really make any changes. 10 00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.520 huda: So I guess like, that's kind of all the my community. Colleg",
    "e courses are starting on Monday. 11 00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:30.149 huda: and then another thing is, I started like so I kinda finished like my react course. So now, I'm starting to develop folklift website, 12 00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:47.059 huda: and then me, and like my like the partner for empowering AI we we finish our planning document for our first week slide. We're supposed to have a slideshow done by Friday. But, we're only we're like we have, like a couple of slides more to go. But 13 00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.550 huda: I'd say, like, we're pretty much done with the first weeks. And then we booked 14 00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.809 huda: library like rooms for us to hold a meeting. 15 00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.790 huda: yeah, it's gonna be like the the second starting the second week of October, I think. 16 00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.670 huda: on Sundays, and we're going to try to meet for like an entire month, like 17 00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.759 huda: once each week, like every Sunday. 18 00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:28.500 huda: cause like we have like 4 lessons planned. So yeah. And then we're also gonna make and then the winner gets like a prize or something. So 19 00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.950 huda: yeah, and then. 20 00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:39.999 huda: oh, yeah. So then the Msa election thing happened, the Muslim Student Association. And 21 00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.350 huda: it was. 22 00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.930 huda: it was like a really terrible experience. Because, yeah, so 23 00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:57.770 huda: basically, what happened was last year. They're like elected some guys who like cheated on the election 24 00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.739 huda: and basically they don't really like me, cause I guess we're like family friends. And then. 25 00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:15.330 huda: they kind of know that I'm trying to like, do these extra curriculars? And they're just not involved as well. So like they don't really like me in that way. So like. 26 00:06:",
    "15.440 --> 00:06:23.019 huda: What I found was that they removed my name from the mailing list so that I can't find out about the elections. 27 00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:47.179 huda: That's crazy. Yeah, I was like, that's like a whole nother level of petty. But no, that's so. That's like, isn't that a not allowed like, isn't that against school policy? Yeah. Me and me and a friend were like actually thinking of talking to like the like the club advisor about it. I think you definitely should. 28 00:06:47.330 --> 00:07:03.190 huda: Yeah. So either, we're like thinking that. And if nothing really happens, I think next year we might try starting like a Muslim girls group like a club. So cause we can discuss issues like this like 29 00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:31.130 huda: basically the officer roles like they're all boys. And they're like the same friend group, and then, like the President, she's handed her role from the last President, even though she wasn't an officer like at all, and one of the requirements is like you have to be an officer for at least one year in order to become President. So it was locally rigged. But yeah, what do you mean? Low key that rigged? 30 00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.320 huda: Yeah. 31 00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.169 Jenny Duan: Well, I think you should definitely bring this up with the advisor. How involved is is the advisor in the club? 32 00:07:38.720 --> 00:08:03.250 huda: I would say, actually, this club. It's honestly they barely have meetings or any events or anything. So I guess I guess, like the advisor isn't that involved? But we're gonna like, not the club advisor, but like the there's like the leadership teacher he like, basically in charge of all the clubs and everything. So we're gonna talk to him on Monday. 33 00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:13.960 Jenny Duan: that that's just like that's just awful that that happened, and that must be so frustrating. And 34 00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:35.090 Jenny Duan: I just wanna say like, Don't let this bring ",
    "you down because I feel like this, isn't it? I mean, obviously it's not a mark on your character at all. But I know that the situation is extremely frustrating, and I think that you know I wouldn't actually wanna be in a club with these people, anyways. So I feel like it's totally fine that you're you're not involved with this, because, like. 35 00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:49.339 Jenny Duan: even if you did get an officer position, you would still have to work with these frustrating people, who would, you know, go out of their way to make it difficult for you. And that type of environment is just really, really negative and like bad for your mental health and everything else, too. 36 00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:57.589 huda: Okay? And like, I mentioned, like these guys who rig this election are the same people that did the 37 00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:04.909 huda: the hack phone club, the the experience like it's the same people. How is it? The same people 38 00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:12.369 huda: I don't know. They just like have like a giant, firm group, and they all like help each other cheat, and like different clubs and stuff. So 39 00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.700 Jenny Duan: that is just that is just terrible like, why has this ever? Has this been reported? 40 00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:30.759 huda: No, but, like honestly, like everyone, just lets it happen, because, like, they want to be friends with them. I don't know. I don't know why they get like. Why would they want to be friends with these people 41 00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:39.049 huda: cause like they benefit each other. So they they wanna be part of their like groups so that they can get their benefits. I guess I don't know 42 00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:49.640 Jenny Duan: but the benefits of cheating or the benefits I don't know. Cause almost like locate. Every single election at our school is really rigged. So 43 00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.440 huda: yeah, we're trying to like for film Makers club. At least, we're trying to do lik",
    "e a really unbiased like. 44 00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:13.380 huda: not at all like relationships with the officers kind of thing and like it has to be fair, and I feel like applications are so much stronger than elections, because elections you can cheat easily, but totally. You could just get all your friends to sign up or to yeah, to sign up for a club just to vote view. And that's like. 45 00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.400 Jenny Duan: so dumb. 46 00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.260 huda: Yeah. 47 00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:35.999 Jenny Duan: wow. Well, I'm sorry that you had to experience that. That sounds really frustrating, and I feel like you've done a really good job of handling the situation, and, you know, seeking out teachers to go reach out to. Because I think sorry. Let me turn off this way. I think you should definitely be advocating for yourself in this type of situation, because. 48 00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:44.479 Jenny Duan: again, like it has nothing. This has nothing to do with you or your behavior anything. It's 100% about their actions and 49 00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:52.130 Jenny Duan: honestly, like their lack of judgment here, you know. So that's super super frustrating. 50 00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.630 Jenny Duan: and okay. 51 00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.749 Jenny Duan: what about any updates on your game. 52 00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:11.669 huda: okay. So I didn't have much time to work on the game this week. Because I was kind of trying to focus more on 53 00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.670 huda: I guess the website cause. 54 00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:26.480 huda: I want to get that up and running, you know, like, just a little bit. Oh, yeah, also for folklift. I got another interview like a planned so 55 00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:39.769 huda: this week, or I guess next. No, this week. I think on Thursday we're gonna meet and film. And we are like preparing with script right now. So yeah, 56 00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:58.740 huda: Did you finish filming the first interview? What's",
    " the status on that the first one. Actually I wouldn't. I don't think we actually got to film because she like the day that we're supposed to film. She flaked out, and then I said, like, can we reschedule? She hasn't replied yet, but 57 00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.809 huda: when you send a follow up to the first person 58 00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:22.229 Jenny Duan: and it's okay, because honestly, like this happens all the time, like people sign up. Then they play. But sometimes you just have to keep bothering them until they eventually respond. And this is always the case like for me when I have to deal with you know my schools. It, for example. 59 00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.430 Jenny Duan: I have to send them like 5 messages, and like, respond really remind them like every 3 days, or else they'll just ignore me. So probably same situation. 60 00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.130 huda: Yes. 61 00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.240 huda: Oh, yeah, the game. I'd say, like 62 00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.380 huda: one thing that I got running was 63 00:12:47.580 --> 00:13:08.440 huda: I started trying to start from like the beginning of the game. So like. You know how sometimes like games is like a chronological like order. I tried like going from the very beginning, like when you first open the game. This scene will play out. So I'm gonna try to give like the context of the game. I started working on that scene. 64 00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:15.190 huda: and kind of like before the whole like robot rogue situation happens. So it's like the exposition. 65 00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:23.010 huda: I think also, I definitely work more on the game this week. I think I wanna try. 66 00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:31.739 huda: I mean, like I want. I don't have like a specific goal in mind. But I think I want to try like doing more dialog cause I'm having like a difficult time 67 00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.940 huda: with actually no, I'm more of a difficult time of the art for the game. So 68 00:13:37.160 --> 00:13",
    ":46.220 huda: I don't know. I think I might have to ask someone for help with that, because I'm not like I'm more of the developer side of game development. So 69 00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.180 huda: yeah. 70 00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.430 Jenny Duan: got it? 71 00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.870 Jenny Duan: And then. 72 00:13:53.460 --> 00:14:01.649 Jenny Duan: okay. And then I think there's one other thing with the game like, have you been able to film any more video tutorials. 73 00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:19.920 huda: No, but I have, like I have one in mind. I think I wrote a script for it. A few days ago. So I think I can probably film it pretty soon. I think I was gonna do a tutorial on like how to do animations within. Unity. 74 00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:27.610 Jenny Duan: yeah, that that totally makes sense. And then, how's the SAT studying going? 75 00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:45.719 huda: I will say, able to take an sat practice test today or this weekend, because I had like a birthday party. Oh, yeah, I think your dad, Sarge mentioned that. How did that go? Happy? Belated birthday. Thank you. It was. It was really fun. I have like all my friends over, and I was like, really nice. 76 00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.259 Jenny Duan: Yay, well, I'm super happy you got to celebrate with your friends, and 77 00:14:50.280 --> 00:15:00.739 Jenny Duan: I'm really happy that, like you have a good group of people who are supportive, because, you know, among all the toxic people in the world really nice to have, like a small group of people who can really count on. 78 00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.430 huda: Yeah, for sure. 79 00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:29.329 huda: Well, other than that sat. I've just been like throughout the week I've been the math document that you sent I've been trying to like. Read over some of the like the formulas that I need. And I've been like setting up, like, you know. Sometimes you have, like the Youtube videos where they'll be like, set up your graph and calculator this ",
    "way to like help you during the sat. I think you're cutting out. 80 00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.470 Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry you just cut out. Can you repeat what you said? I think you said but can you? 81 00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:50.960 huda: Yeah. So and on Youtube, they have like these like videos which are like, set up your graphing calculator this way so that you can use it. During the sat. So I was starting to like, set up my graphic calculator so it could be helpful during the math section. 82 00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.670 Jenny Duan: Awesome sounds great. 83 00:15:53.890 --> 00:16:08.220 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is all really good. I thought we could do like a broad kind of check in on general progress. And I'm gonna open up our track record really quickly to just take a look at that. 84 00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.249 Jenny Duan: One moment. 85 00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.990 Jenny Duan: Okay. 86 00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.520 Jenny Duan: so okay. So I think. 87 00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.190 Jenny Duan: right here with the SAT, and the PSAT. Is that coming up for your school. 88 00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:30.690 huda: Do you have a date? Let me just check the actual date. Okay. 89 00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.850 huda: it's on October fourteenth. 90 00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that gives us about 91 00:16:54.020 --> 00:17:04.229 Jenny Duan: 3 weeks to to kind of like, prepare for the PSAT. So one thing that I really want to highlight this week is, I want you to take a 92 00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:18.629 Jenny Duan: Psat practice test. I think this question about I have a question about the Psat practice test. So on a college board website they have like one. And then they have like 93 00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:27.620 huda: on that like, Pdf, there's like modules. And I don't. I'm not sure like how to take the test, cause 94 00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.680 huda: I think the like. I think the timings don't really make sense to me. So 95 00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.33",
    "0 Jenny Duan: let's just take a look. 96 00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.120 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's take the full length. PS. 18. Non-adaptive. 97 00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.370 Jenny Duan: Oh, I didn't. 98 00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.950 Jenny Duan: Did they move it to online this year? 99 00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.390 Jenny Duan: Do you know if the PSAT. This year's on line. 100 00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.080 Yeah, it is 101 00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.310 Jenny Duan: okay. 102 00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.539 Jenny Duan: So online, pst, and Ms, qt, 103 00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:12.660 Jenny Duan: okay. sign into my practice. And 104 00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.170 yeah. 105 00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.130 Jenny Duan: I think in the in the in 2024, I think it's 106 00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:31.169 Jenny Duan: I mean in 23. I think it's still in purse. I mean, it's still on paper. Is your school doing it online? 107 00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.940 huda: Yeah, we're doing it online on. yeah. 108 00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.980 Jenny Duan: okay. 109 00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.480 Jenny Duan: like. 110 00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.969 Jenny Duan: okay, let's see, practice first on line. 111 00:18:50.920 --> 00:19:02.949 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, so they just recommend taking the digital SAT. So why don't you just do the PSAT. Practice test the full length imp on paper, but 112 00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:15.509 Jenny Duan: the non adaptive. But just do it online. So instead of printing it out, how you normally do just do it like on your screen and look at a computer and then write the answers down on a piece of paper. 113 00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.029 Jenny Duan: is that okay with you? 114 00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.419 huda: Yeah, that makes sense. So I think. 115 00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.529 Jenny Duan: go ahead. 116 00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.099 huda: Yeah, can you like, show me like, how I can take the test? Cause? It's a bit confusing. 117 00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:36.459 Jenny Duan: Yeah, of course. So it",
    "'s so much. Oh, yeah, I see what you mean by the modules. So the module, or just each section, for example, like reading, is a section. Reading 118 00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:43.160 Jenny Duan: a module. 2. Okay. 119 00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:49.609 Jenny Duan: So you're only gonna take one of the module ones you don't have to. 120 00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.920 Jenny Duan: take. Actually, I think you okay, actually, never mind. So think what you're gonna do with this is 121 00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.750 Jenny Duan: You're going to to take 39 min for the first module. 122 00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:29.229 Jenny Duan: The 39 min for the second module, 43 min for the math. Module one and 43 m minutes minutes for the math. Module 2. So set the timer and do the first section 39 min. Stop, take the second module 39 min, stop, take a 10 min, break, then to the first math module, 43 min, stop, and then 43 min for the second math module and stop. So you're gonna be taking 2 reading sections, then 2 math sections. 123 00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.410 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? 124 00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:37.690 huda: Is that is it going to be like the on the actual test or I believe. So, yeah, okay. 125 00:20:37.990 --> 00:21:07.630 Jenny Duan: but I think there, it's gonna be online. So I think what is probably gonna happen is like you're get for reading. You're gonna get one passage, and then you're gonna get a set of like 10 questions. Once you go to the next passage. I don't think you'll be able to click back, so I think you'll be able to click the answers like on your screen, and then I don't think you'll be able to go back after you finish each module or not after you finish module after you finish each passage for the reading section. And then for the math section, I don't think you'll be able to go back 126 00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.540 Jenny Duan: for the math questions. Hi, there! 127 00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.119 huda: Oh, okay, that's 128 00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.110 hud",
    "a: that's different. Right? Yeah. 129 00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.000 Jenny Duan: I'm pretty sure that's how it's gonna go. 130 00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.590 Jenny Duan: let me actually confirm right now. So 131 00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.929 Jenny Duan: new changes. 132 00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.150 Jenny Duan: Psit again. 133 00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 134 00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:51.669 Jenny Duan: the PSAT is gonna be digital and See? It'll be shorter, and it'll have 2 sections. 135 00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.670 Jenny Duan: see? 136 00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.880 Jenny Duan: Belfry. 137 00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.230 Jenny Duan: Well. 138 00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.190 Jenny Duan: okay, yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure that that's just gonna 139 00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:33.679 Jenny Duan: I'm pretty sure that's gonna be how it's administered. But I don't have a confirmation. But other college board testing like the Ap. Tests when they were administered online, you couldn't go back. So that's why I assume that the these tests you won't be able to go back either. 140 00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:40.979 Yeah, hopefully, like. that's something that really different from the actual license fee. So 141 00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:51.460 Jenny Duan: yeah, that's why it's good that you're taking the SAT. Soon. That way, you can take the paper SAT, and not the digital SAT, because that's like a whole different ballpark. 142 00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.310 Jenny Duan: And 143 00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.169 huda: okay, but does it make sense how you're gonna do the PC T test this week. 144 00:22:58.330 --> 00:22:59.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 145 00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:09.340 Jenny Duan: So here are other goals. Video game project where? Okay? So we're not done with the game yet. It's week 8. And again I feel like 146 00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:18.320 Jenny Duan: A game takes a lot of time. And obviously I'm not trying to rush anything. What do you think is a good time",
    "line for? You like finishing the game 147 00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.969 huda: honestly? I don't know. Like 148 00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.380 huda: if I could finish it that soon. So I'd say, like I'd give myself 149 00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.509 huda: like, how how much time maximum do I have cause like 150 00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:42.599 huda: I mean, you don't have that. There is no maximum time done before I applied for like the summer 151 00:23:42.970 --> 00:24:05.259 Jenny Duan: summer programs or time. I think the biggest thing actually is not about developing the game. It's about sharing your story with the game. I think that's the biggest thing like trying to build your digital presence and trying to get pr opportunities for yourself. So trying to have people notice your work, I think that is more important to me than finishing the game itself. 152 00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.710 Jenny Duan: So once you have, like a sample version that you that you're proud of, that you can like take screenshots from or take clips from. I think 153 00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.270 Jenny Duan: that's like more important. 154 00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.770 huda: Yeah. So I'd give myself like, maybe 155 00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:33.169 huda: maybe like 5 weeks, maybe like I don't know if it's too much. But like I wanna give myself like enough time to 156 00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:40.739 huda: like make it well, and also like I was wondering if you had any more like tips, for, like 157 00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:46.450 huda: posted like my journey for game development, because I find like hard and 158 00:24:46.650 --> 00:25:02.150 huda: I find it like what I'm it kind of discourages me from like, actually making the game, because, like they're not to get out the screen recorded. And then like, it's like a whole process like, Do you have any tips like on how to make 159 00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:07.460 huda: like game dev logs. Or I'll just kind of be more consistent online. 160 00:25:08.420 --> 00:2",
    "5:09.679 Yeah, I think, just like. 161 00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:20.050 Jenny Duan: I mean, you don't always have to post like what you are working on. You can also, if you're comfortable with post stuff from your live and also creating like a content schedule 162 00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:30.479 Jenny Duan: is, you know, a good idea. Like, for example, like saying, like, Okay, I want to post this content on this day and like playing that out ahead of time would be 163 00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.259 Jenny Duan: like one way that you can showcase your growth. 164 00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.850 Jenny Duan: Also like, let me, just right now, I'm gonna try to find an example of 165 00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.470 Jenny Duan: someone's social media. 166 00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.830 Jenny Duan: So let's see. 167 00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.190 Jenny Duan: And 168 00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:57.629 Jenny Duan: I'm trying to find, like an example of something to show you. So you can see what another game developing 169 00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:10.119 Jenny Duan: professional social media looks like. But I think just like trying to make it more. Something that's fun for you like it, doesn't. It shouldn't have to be boring for you. 170 00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.510 Jenny Duan: this is one example. So this is like a game. 171 00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:23.390 Jenny Duan: it's, you know, going to be releasing on stream steam. Sorry it has 57,000 followers. 172 00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.619 Jenny Duan: and it just has, like little clips from the 173 00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:40.089 Jenny Duan: from the game. But you can just have these little clips and write a caption, too, like you can just walk through a scene. For example, like learning machine learning, you can just have like a couple photos or 174 00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.959 Jenny Duan: a brief clip like 5 s from your game, and just put a caption over it. 175 00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:55.679 Jenny Duan: That's one way. If you want to feature more of",
    " yourself. let's see. Oh, here's another example. This is someone set up. 176 00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.280 Jenny Duan: This is a pretty cool example. Post. 177 00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.670 Jenny Duan: this is like someone talking about their game. 178 00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.820 Jenny Duan: I think you can do stuff like that, too. 179 00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.599 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? 180 00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.919 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then empowering aid. 181 00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.720 huda: I think you can cut out 182 00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:33.550 Jenny Duan: well, so far. Do you have a ligands list for a oh, sorry. Do you have like an attendance list? Or do you have like a like a group of people who have signed up already. 183 00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:52.099 huda: No, not yet, cause I think. We're trying to get at least like 2 slideshows done before then, because we wanna make sure like the deadline is like solid. But maybe you could have like an interest form. And anyone in the interest form we can like. Add them to the sign up, maybe. 184 00:27:52.850 --> 00:28:00.540 Jenny Duan: that might be. That's that's that's like a good idea. Let me just put that on the list. Okay. 185 00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.720 Jenny Duan: interest on for empowering AI workshop. 186 00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:15.509 Jenny Duan: and then let's continue on the rest of the progress check. 187 00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.579 Jenny Duan: The videos, I think. 188 00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.200 Jenny Duan: And 189 00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.920 Jenny Duan: how is that going? Like the Youtube channel? 190 00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:31.310 huda: So so far, I have like one video or about game to film, at least. 191 00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:56.780 huda: I think, yeah, I should definitely put a lot more effort into like the game. And like Youtube, I find, like, it's just like kind of time consuming, which is like what kind of discourages need. But I think I should like definitely cut dow",
    "n on the time. For like development and such for, like. The website. I think I should like kind of allocate that more towards like the Youtube, video. 192 00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:04.229 huda: yeah, I think it has something that's enjoyable for you, because, again, if you don't enjoy that, then I don't think 193 00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:20.350 Jenny Duan: like at the end of the day it should be something that you personally find meaningful. And all of these suggestions. I tell you they're just my suggestions. But you don't have to do something, just, you know, because I'm saying so, cause I think it should still be like something that you think is worth your time. So is this something that you still think is interesting? 194 00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:28.499 huda: I like, okay, I think it's interesting. But I just, I feel like it's not something that 195 00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.119 huda: I feel like motivated to do sometimes, cause I feel like 196 00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.840 huda: I'm not able to like make it, because, like, then, I have to like 197 00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.100 huda: set up a bunch of things, and I feel like just making the game 198 00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:52.680 huda: itself like. And I think I would post on social media and make some Youtube videos. But I just don't think I would make like videos outside of devlogs. I feel 199 00:29:53.090 --> 00:30:02.280 Jenny Duan: gotcha gotcha. So you know, there's other ways. We can get publicity for your game besides doing social media like if social media is not something that you want to do like. 200 00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:14.989 Jenny Duan: Why don't we try to do? How do you feel about for example being featured in newsletters or being on a podcast is that something that you would want to do? Yeah, definitely. Cause yeah, I think there's still, other ways for you to get 201 00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.389 Jenny Duan: more publicity without 202 00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:47.020 Jenny Duan: the content yourself. So ",
    "this week, maybe one thing we can do is identify. I think I'm gonna put this on hold. I don't think it's we should do it this week because I really wanna focus. And I wanna spend the last couple of minutes here after we finish talking about this on your Ncw. Application cause I think you know that's important. I don't wanna forget that. But I think in the future, like next week we could talk about 203 00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.379 Jenny Duan: reaching out to podcasts newsletters and pitching yourself. 204 00:30:52.880 --> 00:31:04.039 Jenny Duan: Because then, you know, like, instead of writing your own blog, you can just like do an interview with another newsletter, and they can feature your work, and that's also a good way for other people to know about you, too. 205 00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:12.650 Jenny Duan: And so I think. But I do think with the social media, I think it's maybe important to have, like a minimum of say, like 206 00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:34.610 Jenny Duan: one post, or at least a bio that way. When you do a newsletter, they can like link to your website, or they can link to you in some way. So people can follow you. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to be super active if you don't want to be. But there should still be a way for people to like connect to you to reach out to you if they want to say, feature your game somewhere or give you more opportunities. Does that make sense? 207 00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.110 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Sounds good. 208 00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.529 Jenny Duan: So the last thing that I wanted to check in on progress wise is forklift. 209 00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:57.830 Jenny Duan: So I know that our goal was to get 3 videos done. How is that going? I know you have. You have the first person flaked, but we're gonna follow up on them. That's okay. And then the second person is confirmed. 210 00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:09.489 huda: Yeah. And then a meeting up with someone on Tuesday, or like on call. And then we're set",
    "ting a date for their phone session. It's like a clothing brand. 211 00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.969 huda: and they're pretty like 212 00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.290 huda: like I'd say 213 00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:21.640 huda: enthusiastic about about it. They're really looking forward to it. So, yeah. 214 00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.459 Jenny Duan: yeah. And are you excited to do that? Fran? 215 00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:39.340 huda: Yeah, for sure. I think like the one that I've confirmed this week in the filling session. I think I'm really excited about it, because it's like a it's like a match making business and like, Oh, that's exciting ideas. For like the commercials. So, yeah. 216 00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.800 Jenny Duan: awesome. And did you like, did you reach out to them, or did they reach out to you? Or how did they find you? 217 00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:54.540 huda: Ii found them through the Facebook post, yeah, and like local as well and also like 218 00:32:54.730 --> 00:33:13.270 huda: she asked me if I can like continue making videos for her like, I don't know. I think every person I've asked like keeps asking me if I can make multiple videos with them. So like, I think I'm gonna follow up with that offer. Because, like, you know, the more videos I get is like, probably the better. So yeah. 219 00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.210 Jenny Duan: awesome. 220 00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:26.849 Jenny Duan: You're. I think that progress wise, I think. Direction. Because what we what we're focusing on. Oh, sorry. Can you hear me? 221 00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.120 huda: Oh, yeah, hear me. 222 00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.909 Jenny Duan: Okay. Awesome. 223 00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:58.980 Jenny Duan: I think that in the big picture wise, I think what we're really trying to focus on is, first of all, starting more service projects. Because that was one thing that we identified. We're missing. And then also like holding in on your academics. So your sat psat your grades really excited to se",
    "e your progress with the community college class. That's super exciting. And bringing that aspect up. And then finally, like doing some more work in the Cs field, which is what we're doing with empowering 224 00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:13.300 Jenny Duan: forklift, giving you some more web development. Experience. So big picture overview. That's kind of what we're working towards and really rounding out your profile to prepare you for, like Cs adjacent majors at top schools. 225 00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:26.960 Jenny Duan: That being said, I wanna transition back into the awards thing that we were working on earlier. So the Nc. It award I saw that you put in more drafts. Will you walk me through the changes that you've made this week? 226 00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:42.149 huda: So I kinda I started making the second draft one. I feel like the first sentence is kinda like an unread thought, but like unfinished thought. But like the first paragraph is kinda like 227 00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:53.630 huda: we like brainstorming. I got a little busy, like homework and stuff. I tried like working on the essays, but I wasn't able to finish them. But 228 00:34:53.790 --> 00:35:09.989 huda: yeah, I was like kind of talking about like what I saw as like a young kid like what I imagined cause I always imagined myself like working with computers as a kid. And I kinda like emphasize that. And 229 00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:32.220 huda: I tried like mentioning like the things like we talked about last week. About like wanting to study Cs in college and doing the projects and stuff. And I feel like like the way I put it, just kind of feels to force. So I'm not really happy with the way I wrote it. But yeah, so 230 00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:37.850 Jenny Duan: how would you write it if you feel like, how would you tell your story if it didn't feel forced. 231 00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:44.079 Jenny Duan: Let me just okay. Let's just forget about the writing. I'm going to ask you this question. I want you to ",
    "just talk to me 232 00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:52.410 Jenny Duan: like, don't don't worry about writing any of this down. I'll take notes. Describe how technology may play a central role as you imagine your future. 233 00:35:53.690 --> 00:36:21.880 huda: What kind of like? Okay, what I'm saying in the paragraph is honest, but just sounds force, even though it isn't. But like I honestly did see myself like working with other people, and like I guess I had some vision of like like me and some friends like sitting at a table, you know, working on the computer and like building robots and stuff and doing all this cool things as a as a kid. 234 00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:31.320 huda: and I just like going up. I saw that there weren't many like other people like me, like like girls. 235 00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.520 huda: really like 236 00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:37.100 huda: anyone wasn't as like motivated, and no one really 237 00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.350 huda: were in the field, and it was like not really like 238 00:36:41.200 --> 00:37:03.320 huda: save space like it didn't feel like a safe space for me. And I kind of wanted to change that. And I think. now, that like I'm growing, and I'm able to do these things like, have a nonprofit do boot camps and stuff. I think that will definitely play a central role in my life in the future, like cause I wanna continue that cause. 239 00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:14.769 huda: It's not just because of academics. It's cause. I generally want to empower like younger girls. Also. Yeah, 240 00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:25.510 huda: and I just, I think. like I grew up wanting to be this way. And I wanna kind of fulfill my younger soul's dreams. 241 00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:39.279 Jenny Duan: See? That's perfect. So I think maybe what we're what you're noticing is just like the beginning. You don't feel like like this way that you're writing is authentic. Right? So 242 00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:49.030 Jenny Duan: let's describe, I think, what would be really ",
    "cool. So this is the framework that I wrote down, based on what you said so like first immersing the person in the scene like 243 00:37:49.030 --> 00:38:13.069 Jenny Duan: you were saying, like heads down, like working, tinkering on a piece of code, say next to your friends, and like so first doing this imagery of the scene, and then the next sentence will be like, this is a life that you've imagined as a kid, like sitting with a bunch of other nerdy girls like working on really, really cool projects and creating something incredible, right? But then, contrasting that with, as you grew older, you realize that like this space. 244 00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:21.139 Jenny Duan: it's not a safe space, because there are really, really aggressive and frustrating people like the people who have the 245 00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:44.119 Jenny Duan: have the Hackathon Club, for example. There's people like that who try to block you out of opportunities. And you realize, like in the space, only 24% of people of game developers are female. And it's a very hard space as a young woman to like. Make your path here right? And to stand out and because you notice the struggle. As a successful game developer yourself. 246 00:38:44.120 --> 00:39:01.450 Jenny Duan: you want to change that. So now that you're older, you have a nonprofit and you know, you're doing a lot of work because you genuinely want to empower other people. And you see this playing essential role in your future beyond academics. So now, as you are looking forward. It's wanting to study computer science in college. 247 00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:14.439 Jenny Duan: You realize, like you've grown up because you've grown up this way, you, your goal is like fulfilling yourself streams, and also inspire the people that you know you work with through your nonprofit to pursue their dreams as well. 248 00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.620 huda: Yeah. 249 00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.370 Jenny Duan: like like, that's kind of a layout. 250 00:39:21",
    ".240 --> 00:39:23.340 huda: So 251 00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:28.099 huda: oh, go ahead. Summarizes like how I feel about it. So yeah. 252 00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.750 Jenny Duan: so I think now it just comes down to like writing this. 253 00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.110 Jenny Duan: So of it. 254 00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:48.399 Jenny Duan: What would it be? Helpful if maybe like, we started working like if we wrote the first couple of sentences together, and then maybe you can fill in the rest of the essay. Would that be good? 255 00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.500 Jenny Duan: Okay. 256 00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:55.880 Jenny Duan: So how would you? Can you describe to me that scene one more time that you're talking about here. 257 00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:22.439 huda: Kind of over here like I imagine myself like sitting at a table with a bunch of other girls like kind of like nerdy and like quiet nerdy girls sitting at a table like typing away at her computers like tinkering with robots at our table and like collaborating and having fun while doing it. 258 00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:36.019 Jenny Duan: Okay, and collaborating to solve. I'm gonna say, like. 259 00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.690 Jenny Duan: so. 260 00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.650 Jenny Duan: like some type of solve 261 00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.270 Jenny Duan: the most emergent problems. 262 00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.219 Jenny Duan: I think we can change that language. 263 00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.500 huda: But let me just write that down. For now. 264 00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.660 Jenny Duan: integrate and 265 00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:04.670 Jenny Duan: okay, can you put me in that scene like. 266 00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:12.449 Jenny Duan: Don't put yourself in it. Don't say like I'm sitting here. Put me in it like what does? What are you seeing? What are you touching like 267 00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:25.199 Jenny Duan: involve the senses? I wanna I wanna like, feel like I'm watching that the scene from a movie like you like movies",
    ", you like film. Right? You're really good at making videos, say, like as a director, what are you putting in this scene? 268 00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:44.299 huda: Okay? So in the background, like, you can see people like talking, and you know, just like there'll be like a crowd and like it'll be a lot of people. But the people that stand out to. You are like this group of girls that are that are like, I guess. 269 00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.840 huda: like figuratively like kinda like like 270 00:41:48.870 --> 00:42:07.449 huda: very happy and like vibrant and like, cause they're very happy at what they do. So you'd have like them talking, and you like hear them, and they're like conversations. Try and get at a problem, and like helping each other with like little parts of the code and 271 00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.869 huda: and like maybe to frame it like 272 00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.480 huda: in a director kind of way. I'd say. 273 00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:24.099 huda: like, I just like, wanna emphasize that they like probably stand out like a lot from everyone else. I don't know how to like word it, though. 274 00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.530 huda: I'd say. 275 00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.359 huda: like, okay. So maybe like some like how in different they are. 276 00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:48.050 huda: maybe we could talk about like how everyone's like laughing and like not really paying attention to their surroundings. But this, like this group, is like attentive to their like, their goals, maybe like, which is the computer 277 00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.770 Jenny Duan: of code. 278 00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.399 Jenny Duan: the feel, how, how, what is the feeling. 279 00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:12.389 huda: the feeling of like satisfaction, as I guess we probably debug the code, maybe 280 00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.870 Jenny Duan: feeling of satisfaction. And 281 00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:34.320 Jenny Duan: okay, this is like a beginning. You know, it's a rough draft. We can edit i",
    "t. But 282 00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:58.029 Jenny Duan: this is what I put down to start. The sound of laughter and the cooking of laptop keys fills the space. I pointed the screen next to mine, identifying a bug in a line of code. The feeling of collaboration and satisfaction lights up the room. This was the life I imagined as a kid sitting at a table surrounded by girls like me typing away at lines of code, chinking with robots and collaborating to solve the most emergent problems. 283 00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.400 Jenny Duan: How does that sound? For like an opening 284 00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.950 huda: sounds amazing. 285 00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Now. 286 00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:12.629 Jenny Duan: it's up to you to finish the rest. I know that you can do it. And again, we already have the the outline done. 287 00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:35.889 Jenny Duan: Now, all you need to do is just fill it in like. However, as I got older, you realize it's not a safe space. You learn that only 24% of people are female anyways, the outlines here. This is. These are all the points that we wanted to put in. That we talked about last time. So I think, being able to get a draft of this essay again, it's only 250 words. It's not a long essay. That's why, like 288 00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:46.279 Jenny Duan: every sent, every like little paragraph, should have only like a couple of sentences, because 250 words is really not a lot like we talked about this. This was 250 words. Right? 289 00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:56.169 Jenny Duan: This is not a lot of text at all. So same thing here, not a lot of writing. Just get the ideas down and we can revise polish. Don't worry about it being perfect. 290 00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.790 huda: Okay, thank you. 291 00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:05.799 Ivy Mentors: This is amazing. Actually have it. I'm glad that I joined. Sorry I was a bit late, but just loved the the way 292 00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:23.620 Ivy Mentors: you just struct",
    "ured this. Thanks, Jenny, I think, taking her through like the immersive and the contrasting part, I think there's so much learning for everyone here. But also, I think. I know we are top of the hour, I mean, I actually you know, this is kind of a good revelation for me as well 293 00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:35.390 Ivy Mentors: as we have been discussing a few times, and I shared with you, I think. Since the time that lucky day when you kind of took over the the mentorship for Houdini. And really fortunate for that. 294 00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:54.249 Ivy Mentors: You know, initially, like our thinking and my understanding was really about hey? You know, just the checklist. hey? You know she's she's doing her academics. Let her get some good, sat scores and psat, and and and I knew that we have passion projects was a huge thing, and that's why she had actually started with Janice as well. 295 00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:12.120 Ivy Mentors: But then the whole understanding around, like, you know, hey, this is like a big holistic kind of evaluation or a game, you know, at the end of the day, very strategic in nature everything has to be taken care of, and students need to work on everything was a good learning experience. 296 00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:30.649 Ivy Mentors: And I think the key, and also like you know, you know, thanks to you, I being we've also like kind of learned on how multiple things need to be weave together right? Just to kind of stand out eventually. Regardless of whichever top school you're talking about. 297 00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:38.749 Ivy Mentors: One is your kind of your aptitude, and that's clearly like I'm I'm kind of reiterating what I've learned, and and also for HUD to be on the same page 298 00:46:38.910 --> 00:47:08.230 Ivy Mentors: is like, Okay, computer science, clearly like, you know, is her aptitude as well regardless. And it's good to know independently, like, you know. Hear her say that story like it's it's very reaffirming that you know she",
    " is not forcefully trying to create something, but it's very generally and authentically coming from her, which is great. Then second, was also her passion something that I completely know as a parent like, you know. With my biases and background pretty much. Saw that as as a distraction for my older daughter, and also for for Houda. 299 00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:15.800 and II stand reformed and corrected today as a parent like, you know, her video skills and videography is amazing. 300 00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:25.150 Ivy Mentors: And then, of course, like, you know, the community impact aspect like again, these are the kind of 3 things that I've taken away and learned over the months that we have worked together. 301 00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:36.220 Ivy Mentors: Now the thing so, and and and you very, you know, strategically and and very tactically put an entire roadmap for Huda here, which is great 302 00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.420 Ivy Mentors: now. 303 00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:41.719 Ivy Mentors: I think the the real kind of exploration that 304 00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:53.050 Ivy Mentors: I've also been doing with Hoda and Huda's been doing herself is like, how do we like weave that profile? Right? And it became evident that video skills are critically important because that's her passion. 305 00:47:53.080 --> 00:48:02.229 Ivy Mentors: And then like aptitude. But I think what I mean. This is kind. It was a very re, you know, very enlightening kind of last 15 min for me. 306 00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.180 Ivy Mentors: where I also feel like Huta is a gimmer at her heart, right? 307 00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:22.280 Ivy Mentors: Which which which I know that I've I've seen her like, you know, who does like one of those gaming you know, and I don't know how like a lot of Asian parents take it like, you know, cutthroat like, at least in my experience, not something that we truly value like. At least I didn't value a lot. 308 00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:28.369 Ivy Mentors: But that's real",
    "ly something that she's so so passionate about like this whole kind of immersive experience, she explained. I never knew about it. 309 00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:36.649 Ivy Mentors: and also like, when I start connecting dots. Now I see that that's what she's been doing like throughout developing games, developing games, developing games. 310 00:48:36.850 --> 00:49:00.600 Ivy Mentors: So and and then the whole story around game developer. And and you brought out that 24% on a female. And then the whole kind of struggles that who guys going through in her kind of school high school as as a you know, in in a voice club being like, you know, one of the few girls who are actually pursuing this. It kind of makes me rethink, then, isn't isn't that kind of a true passion like being a game developer? 311 00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:06.360 Ivy Mentors: And I think, you know, there can be multiple passions. The reason why I'm bringing this up again is 312 00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:19.220 Ivy Mentors: number one, like, you know, with, based on the experiences that happened last week for Huda. I wanted Houda also kind of Houda and me to kind of further kind of understand. Why are we doing certain things right? 313 00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:35.579 Ivy Mentors: I think what is important. And and I think she's on a a good track. But why is also critically important? And because I don't want without to feel like, you know, every lot of people around her are checking, taking lot of boxes right? So I had a a kind of 314 00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:55.649 Ivy Mentors: you know, a session with whoever I was trying to understand. Why does she feel she cannot do it? She cannot get, and lot of her answers went around. Oh, I haven't ticked this box. I haven't ticked that box right? I don't. I have a be in one of my grades. And then oh, I have nothing to show from a community perspective, you know, from my kind of local community I can show nothing. 315 00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:01.459 Ivy Mentors: And she would ",
    "tell that. Oh, I think that guy will get into Berkeley. I think this girl will get into Brown 316 00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:13.859 Ivy Mentors: so like, you know, she has this feeling, even though I don't think there's a significant difference like in my understanding. But then I would ask like, Why do you think this person would make it okay? Because her dad actually studied in brown? 317 00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:29.030 Ivy Mentors: And you know the. And and then he would. She would say that, oh, because this guy is actually raising funds like her neighbor, he's actually raising a lot of funds and you know, he seems to be like making a lot of. So I think some ways I feel like every student has this thing. Where 318 00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:34.999 Ivy Mentors: in the peer pressure. They feel like they are not doing enough, and they just want to tick all the boxes. 319 00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:42.729 Ivy Mentors: But what I want here is to really like kind of revisit the whole roadmap and strategy that you made. 320 00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:58.969 Ivy Mentors: and for HUD to know that at the end of the day there is a certain kind of strategic plan and focus that she has, like you are guiding her with. And it's okay. If she's not doing like raising funds, it's okay. If she's not being a part of this Msa. Club because of whatever politics. 321 00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:01.719 Ivy Mentors: But still there is a game plan. 322 00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:09.600 Ivy Mentors: and I think one of the things that I would also love to bring some focus on is like, you know, if she really wants to go deep on game development. 323 00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:17.920 Ivy Mentors: right? I'm more than happy to kind of work on that kind of, you know. Explore that path right? Any college, you know, that is like a top college for game developers. 324 00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:40.880 Ivy Mentors: I, you know, or a very interdisciplinary program, right? Like, I know that. Who that wants to do? Cs, but I feel like h",
    "er passions are still like, you know, the the manifestation of those skills is still a game developer. The manifestation of or her kind of video skills is also, like, you know, making, like, you know, creative as you rightly said, she wants to create things. She wants to empower people 325 00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:58.849 Ivy Mentors: so sorry it's it's fully loaded. But I think in in some ways right. You know I would love to pick your thoughts on. How do you think we should further like strategize? So that who that is more clear on, on. You know the college she's applying to, or the program she is really pursuing, because I still feel that clarity is not there yet. Right? 326 00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.130 Jenny Duan: Sorry. 327 00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.369 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, totally makes sense. 328 00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:10.429 Jenny Duan: So, Huda, I know that we've talked about a lot of alternatives to computer science and computer science in general, I think it'd be really 329 00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:28.089 Jenny Duan: pool again to do computer science. But at some schools they might have computer game design concentrations or game development concentrations. Now, how do you feel about game design as your career path is this, you know what you want to do the most? Or are you still exploring within computer science. 330 00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:56.109 huda: Yeah, definitely, I think Usc actually has a game development program. And that's something like, I think, like, instead of applying for film, I think I'd much rather like, apply for game development, because that's something that wanna like way more in like experience with and like to. Also, it's not as competitive like, I mean, it's still competitive, but like in comparison to like Usc, like film, it's definitely less competitive. 331 00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:01.040 Jenny Duan: Totally yeah. I think you University. 332 00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:21.349 Jenny Duan: U. Usc. Has a game development program. Same with",
    " Ucsc, University of California. Santa Cruz also has a game development program which is pretty cool. I think they're the. They're the first Ucsc is the first Uc school to launch an undergrad game development program. 333 00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:34.170 Jenny Duan: So that's pretty cool. It's also local. So I'm wondering if they have any like high school opportunities. This is something that I can look into after this and see, because if Ucse has a couple of high school like programs. 334 00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:54.220 Jenny Duan: That'd be something you can look into, or even taking a class there like in the summer, or something given that, you know, it's super close to you. That could be really cool. Also, I think Cmu has a game development program. I believe. They have a game designer which is really cool. 335 00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.280 Jenny Duan: I think Georgia Tech has 336 00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:04.210 Jenny Duan: they have, like digital and computational media, which is pretty similar to game design. NYU, has game design. 337 00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:09.720 Ivy Mentors: okay. So 338 00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:34.340 Jenny Duan: who has mit has something called comparative media studies which might be interesting to you? Comparative media studies has a concentration in games and interactive media. So like comparative media studies might be interesting if you're interested in like studying, combining film and Cs and studying like media through a lens of like both development, uiux film 339 00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:38.770 Jenny Duan: and games that that might be a good fit at mit 340 00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.839 huda: to combine like game development and film. 341 00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:45.570 huda: I'd be really interested 342 00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.670 Ivy Mentors: yeah, let me just send you some more information on that 343 00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:56.769 Ivy Mentors: I think the good thing, however, is that, like whatever she is focused on, I think you very beaut",
    "ifully articulated again, like, you know, in terms of 344 00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:24.409 Ivy Mentors: Cs, and then community. And then her academics. I think it. It can be re purpose right. And we've together in in kind of so I think that's a good thing, right? It won't be like significantly. She won't be like pivoting correct like if she decides to do something. I think what she's doing. We're putting her on the track to study exactly what she wants to do, because, like ha! Let's think about how our film and how our Cs connected. It's all about creating something. 345 00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:33.739 Jenny Duan: And same with building community like, you're creating something for other people to improve their lives. That's basically at the heart of what you do, whether that's you know what? Depending on. 346 00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:46.730 Jenny Duan: regardless of the medium you're choosing. Film CS. Non profit work. What you're doing is you're creating something to improve someone's life. And you're telling a story in multiple, different ways. And I think that's like 347 00:55:46.800 --> 00:56:00.920 Jenny Duan: that's at the heart of what you do. And as long as we're able to stick with that theme in all of your extracurriculars like they all connect, and there's no need to pivot, because, you know, at the end of the day, like everything that you're doing is already putting you on that path towards where you want to be. 348 00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:06.760 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. I think that last. I think you also really brought that clarity. Thanks so much, Jenny, because 349 00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:15.049 Ivy Mentors: you basically said that these are all mediums. I think we have to clearly like, you know, I think this is where? You know, it's very hard to kind of separate these 2 350 00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:32.570 Ivy Mentors: at the end of the day. What do you want to be? Your path. To what do you want to be right like that is really your authentic self, your story. And ",
    "that's where you're gonna succeed. And Co. Contrib to the community or the world. Right? I think you've you. And I think this is where a lot of things go wrong, because 351 00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:46.549 Ivy Mentors: people clearly like start associating the medium with the goal. Right? It's like, Oh, Cs, I want to be a developer. The only way forward for me. And I think that really comes, unfortunately, also through various ignorance, right? Because that's how we grew up coming from our backgrounds. 352 00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.249 Ivy Mentors: So I love it like, for example, I'll be very honest like. 353 00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:59.160 Ivy Mentors: I have really come to appreciate like symbolic systems. You know, like, you are symbolic system in Stanford, and nude is also symbolic system. 354 00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:17.570 Ivy Mentors: I think new, you know, is is kind of she's in neuroscience and computer science, some kind of other mix right? And then you have psychology. And so these are like, you know, I would love with that for you to like, you know. Jenny, is already giving so much. I think she's gonna guide you, but I think I would love you to kind of really go deep 355 00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:27.730 Ivy Mentors: search like, you know, what are the programs that excite you? And whatever you're working. The good thing is that you've gone. You've done a very. You've given the first principle components to do that. 356 00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:33.990 Ivy Mentors: that she has those components that. Can we then be weaved into whatever she wants to get in so 357 00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:41.020 Ivy Mentors: great? So yeah, that you don't have to worry about. If people are re raising funds, and you're not able to raise funds. 358 00:57:41.070 --> 00:58:05.390 Jenny Duan: It doesn't matter if the head of why do you need to raise funds? You're not studying business. This. Why does that matter to you? It doesn't relate to you. Other people aren't starting nonprofits right? O",
    "ther people aren't making games like you don't need to worry about them. They're they're not doing what you're doing, either. There's like this guy on our street, and like he's, he's like selling like sat Prep, or something like some boot camp. Right? 359 00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:23.060 huda: I'm not sure does that matter. He's not making. He's not making films, he's not, you know. He's not making video games. He's not teaching AI classes. He's selling sat camps like anyone can sell an sat camp. But no one, not everyone can make a video right like. 360 00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:42.039 Ivy Mentors: And and this is a problem like Jenny, like throughout, you know, all the students. I know that you have a call with Anushka now. But thanks a lot. This is actually I forgot to mention anushka, actually emailed me to reschedule. So it's actually okay. I wanna spend a couple of more minutes with. And I wanted to show you this really quickly. 361 00:58:42.040 --> 00:59:08.550 Jenny Duan: This is just some inspiration. A lot of schools have similar programs, not just Mit's but this is Mit's program, just like for inspiration. Mit has a program called comparative media studies. And I just want to show you some of the classes offered through this program. Like, if you went to Mit, you could do commute comparative media studies and Cs, you could do both of them like double major minor, whatever. But here's some really cool classes that I think you might be interested in, like 362 00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:37.949 Jenny Duan: introduction to media studies, game studies. That's a class. Immersive social worlds like, how do you use like virtual reality? AR. Xr. To make social worlds designing virtual worlds? Again, how do you design, a virtual world, the art and science of time, travel, reading, climate through media, visual studies. You know, education, creating video games, creating Internet studies, games and culture fans and fan cultures, current debates in media. Cs, forward the future ",
    "of K 12 Cs education. 363 00:59:38.260 --> 01:00:00.179 Jenny Duan: global Chinese cinema money as media electives, you know, advanced projects, art, culture and technology, technology and culture. The film experience, literature and film studies and film documentary acting with the camera introduction to film, you know, etcetera, what this is 364 01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:10.679 Ivy Mentors: I mean. I never thought that Mit had anything to do with liberal arts. And you know, videography and all that stuff like to be like when I think of Mit, it's just like math and science. And 365 01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:13.070 Ivy Mentors: all these temp things, you know. 366 01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:30.210 Jenny Duan: Wow, impressive. Yeah. But look at this. Look at this course. South Asian America, transnational media culture and history. That isn't that cool look, short attention span documentary. This is an MIT course like these are all you know, virtual reality and immersive media production. 367 01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:42.540 Ivy Mentors: that's all. Those are all courses at Mit. You could take. Look, I mean she's elated. I'm so excited, I mean, come on like I never thought you see the the oh, my God! Thanks, Jenny, like this is so valuable. 368 01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:55.680 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I'm just telling you, like, the world is very broad, like you, if like the classes and things that are offered to you. Not just at Mit, at other schools as well are like we can combine your in. 369 01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:18.879 Jenny Duan: There's is a space for your interest, so don't worry if you don't think it's connected because other people do like you might not think Cs and film are connected, but they definitely are like, if you just looked at these courses like virtual reality and immersive media production. That's like, you know. VR, AR. Xr, how do we create media? That can be, you know. Look, looked at. Listen to in these different forms. 370 01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:26.870 Jenny D",
    "uan: Yeah, so I think this is pretty cool. Look, does that add in development of games for learning? Isn't that basically what you're doing like games for learning. 371 01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:38.040 Ivy Mentors: There you go. Amazing, amazing, I mean, is, is this your new kind of target? I think this should be a new dream for them. 372 01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:39.100 Ivy Mentors: Sorry? 373 01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:59.170 huda: Yeah, it's like, it's such a. There's so many courses. And like, they're also interesting, like, they're all things are like, really interested in. And II didn't think that there's like even thing, even like courses that can talk about like things that are that niche. But like. 374 01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:01.200 huda: wow! It's like, so cool. 375 01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:17.230 Ivy Mentors: I mean, like, I mean, I'm just looking like, not even knowing, like just looking at these courses. I know that Hoda does these things today like this is what she does. Right? So to me, like, it's a validation that someone's like actually preparing a custom program for who that kind of a girl, you know. 376 01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:28.020 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, like, there's a space for you. Don't worry about your interest like someone else sees their Val sees this value. And look there. 377 01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:53.100 Jenny Duan: obviously, if they're going to create a whole major around a subject, that means that there's enough people to want to take that major like they're not gonna make a major for one person, right? There has to be multiple peoples enough for them to sustain faculty to open classes in this major, which means that they are taking. They're looking for people with your background. Schools like Mit are looking for people with your background. Your interest to come in and take these classes, otherwise they wouldn't have 378 01:02:53.240 --> 01:03:08.860 Jenny Duan: even offered like any of these classes. Look at how many classes",
    " there are like they have to have to sustain faculty to, you know, teach all of those classes, and to be able to do that. They have to have students like you who are interested. So there, schools like Mit are looking for people like you. 379 01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.480 huda: Rather so inspiring. Actually. 380 01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:23.969 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think so without now, you just have to get a perfect sat score. You know, it's very simple. So because Mit needs also, like good academics, right? So II think, this is amazing. 381 01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:37.679 Ivy Mentors: I I'm just wondering, like, you know, why is this thing not like you know, so easily understood. like or not accessible, or like, I would say, it's out there like, these things are all like, freely available. Right? 382 01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's just on the Internet. Yeah. 383 01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:42.940 Ivy Mentors: So I think it's really up to. Yeah. 384 01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.340 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think it's because, like 385 01:03:45.350 --> 01:04:12.870 Jenny Duan: Hood, I don't know if you experienced this, but I think, especially in the Bay area, there's this pressure to like study Cs or study engineering or like. And people like have a very narrow understanding of what CS. Is because people think like, okay, CS, you know, you're gonna go into software engineering. But in CS. Or in tech, there's so many different roles like, obviously, there's game development in game development. There are a ton of roles in game development. You know, it can be like a unity game development. 386 01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:28.090 Jenny Duan: You could be like a mobile app game developer. You could do like AR vrxr. Like all of that, is all different. And I think because people aren't aware that all these opportunities are available. It's leaves a very limited understanding of what's out there. And so people like. 387 01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:46.759 Jenny Duan: And I think ",
    "also there's I don't know if you experienced this at all. But when I was applying for college. I noticed that like people kind of like, they look at the humanities. And they look like, okay, maybe this isn't as serious as Cs, and so we won't have to spend as much time on it. But in reality there's so many programs that really value the humanities that 388 01:04:46.810 --> 01:05:01.600 Jenny Duan: you know. Take the humanities and integrate them with technology like this, media studies program and turn it into something like different, but also like something in and of itself, that's really cool. And so I think because of all these factors, and I just think people like 389 01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:07.389 Jenny Duan: Don't like pay attention to this type of opportunity, even though it might be something that they might be like. 390 01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:11.919 Jenny Duan: good at or interested in, or you know, curious about, or whatever 391 01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:26.999 Ivy Mentors: absolutely. I mean, you have 5 more minutes because this is a very important point Jenni, do you? Do you have 5? So I think you're raising a very important point, and I think, 392 01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:34.629 Ivy Mentors: th. This is a problem that needs to address. And and I think the more I'm thinking about it because think about it, especially in terms of like target college. 393 01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:44.070 Ivy Mentors: And I'm actually using Anushka's example as well here. Right? So so who does a bit of like, you know? Iv mentor discussion as well. Okay, so don't be bothered. But it is relevant. 394 01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.660 Ivy Mentors: Because if you think about it right like coming back to your point. 395 01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.000 Ivy Mentors: students, parents. 396 01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:52.730 Ivy Mentors: environment. 397 01:05:53.140 --> 01:06:06.049 Ivy Mentors: everything kind of forces you to have a very narrow thinking, and people start thinking about it very binar",
    "y till the kind of end, you know, and might be. Unless they experience it. And and unless someone like you explains it. 398 01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:21.589 Ivy Mentors: and especially when it comes to stem. Because if you think about stem really like, you know, Silicon Valley Bay Area is kind of the the industrial kind of output right? Of what an impact stem can have to the world technology, right. 399 01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.070 Ivy Mentors: And 400 01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:26.969 Ivy Mentors: just think about it, because I've I've seen this in multiple students now. 401 01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:39.900 Ivy Mentors: And they immediately come. And they say, What do you want to do? I want to do. Cs, I want to do this. And then why eventually they all tie up to the it all eventually lands into the outcome, which is literally getting a good job and getting good pay 402 01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.789 Ivy Mentors: period right? It all starts there. 403 01:06:42.910 --> 01:07:02.909 Ivy Mentors: So what happens is again, and I think industry is to be blamed as well, because industry, unfortunately, is being run and led by the older generation. Right? There's a gap there. It might be things that evolve where people are not catching up. So there's clearly a gap between the industry and the college academics, right? We all know that. 404 01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:24.080 Ivy Mentors: So what's happening is like Anushka. It was very interesting for her to eventually come to even cyber security right? And there's no harm in it, because her mom is a Vp of product and cyber security right? And that's what happens. Right? Doctor. Parents basically want their stood. You know, their their kids to have a future in physic become a physician. 405 01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:39.389 Ivy Mentors: See us, even though I don't say in my heart there might be like, Oh, yeah, you you should be working at Apple sometime, you know, like I want you to. And I never forced with that, by the way, right, you know. ",
    "And also her older sister. She definitely didn't want to do stem, she ended up in design as an example. 406 01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:47.379 Ivy Mentors: But I think this is the problem, Jenny, what's happening is even with my older daughter right? Think about it now. Design is a big space. 407 01:07:47.630 --> 01:08:07.540 Ivy Mentors: And when you think about job opportunities, and and this is something that she started exploring because she got kind of pure design. Then she got business. And then she got in. Cal Poly. It's actually a graphic design kind of of program in Cal Poly. It is not ux design Us. Design is a part of the program, but overall, it's a very different program. 408 01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:16.109 Ivy Mentors: So Davis, on the other hand actually has a very kind of ux design kind of program, right? A Uxr kind of stuff. 409 01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:25.020 Ivy Mentors: So when she was exploding herself to decide that I was actually sitting with her, and I told her as a parent, you know what I don't like graphic design. I told her. 410 01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:42.490 Ivy Mentors: When we were exploring. I said, You know why? Because your job art opportunities are gonna be limited doesn't matter. You know what like. You can do as much ux courses inside. When you come out. When I look at as a hiring manager, I look at your profile and you tell me that you are actually a graphic designer. I'm like, okay, she's more like a graphical person. Right? I really need that 411 01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:45.699 Ivy Mentors: like human user experience designer, right? 412 01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:53.970 Ivy Mentors: And I think this is where the challenges that people are driven. And I think that needs to be solved somewhere. I think it's a bigger problem to be solved because 413 01:08:54.020 --> 01:09:03.470 Ivy Mentors: given like 5 resume is. you know, any person in the industry would actually go for that niche right like, oh, I need a Cs guy like, you know. Give me a Cs be",
    "cause I want a developer 414 01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:16.089 Ivy Mentors: right? Right? But there are interdisciplinary roles that are also evolving in industry. Like product management is a great example. It's one of the most interdisciplinary arts, right? And there is no program today on the face of the earth 415 01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:37.469 Ivy Mentors: from a top school that actually talks about product management. But everyone knows in the industry that the most coveted role is actually a product management role. Actually, Berkeley has a product manager. Master's program. Oh, really okay, Masters again, like an undergrad. Probably not. But it it will happen right like. So III don't know if that makes sense. But I think that's pretty much the problem. II think. 416 01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:39.060 Ivy Mentors: as 417 01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:51.720 Ivy Mentors: And I'm seeing that problem as well, right like, even in terms of trying to match mentors with like, whoever comes there always go for like, oh, I need someone with Cs, I need someone with biomed and Econ. See, this is the funny thing 418 01:09:52.050 --> 01:09:57.039 Ivy Mentors: like business has evolved so much, and people still want to go with economics. 419 01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:00.180 Ivy Mentors: Think about it like, you know, I want an e-comm grad. 420 01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:12.510 Ivy Mentors: and I'm like, you know why, Econ grad, you know, like, what is what is so like? This is about international relationships, you know. Like, why do you need an Econ grad. Oh, but that's that's kind of the fundamental business degree, you know. So 421 01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.089 Ivy Mentors: and totally, yeah. 422 01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:30.439 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think I think we need to solve this. I think, this is clearly a gap that parents and students, when they are planning their strategy and roadmap. I think college list and program list is a long process. Also, I'm I'm discovering now, right? Like, it can",
    "not be solved like in a 423 01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:34.380 Ivy Mentors: 15 min session. You have to work, and you have to keep evolving it. Yeah. 424 01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.310 Jenny Duan: totally yeah. 425 01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:38.310 Ivy Mentors: Amazing 426 01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:41.270 Jenny Duan: cool. Who are there any more questions? 427 01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.970 huda: Not right now. But I'll let you know if I have any. 428 01:10:47.470 --> 01:11:16.680 Jenny Duan: Well, yeah. Well, I'm really excited for you. I think you know this direction that we're taking is really good. And I think if we look back like at where you were just one month, 2 months ago. I think you really grown a lot, and I would say, like, Don't be discouraged by all these people around you, because at the end of the day, like, you're doing what you're doing, they're doing what they're doing. And they're not doing what you're doing. You're not doing what they're doing. It doesn't matter what they're doing, because you're not them right like 429 01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:41.230 Jenny Duan: they're obviously they have different goals. You have your own goals. So just focus on what you're doing and tune out everything else. Because at the end of the day that doesn't impact you, you're you're the only person responsible for your own success, and you know other people's success. You can wish them well. But like at the end of the day. It's like you that you should be focused on, because the more time you spend thinking about other people, the less time you're thinking about yourself and like what you're doing. 430 01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:44.549 huda: Yeah, thank you so much. That's so encouraging. 431 01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:57.509 Jenny Duan: Yeah, of course. Well, I'm really excited to see what you're doing this week and keep me updated on how everything's going. I'd like to see hopefully, if you have time. I'd like you to finish drafting. The 432 01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.410 Jenny Duan: say",
    "s essay is well, just because I do know that the deadlock 433 01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:07.719 Jenny Duan: searching, and I want to make sure that we're able to look over this and make sure that it's all set for submitting. 434 01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:09.550 huda: Okay? 435 01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:20.469 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. And yeah, I'm looking forward to actually have a meeting, you know who that we we'll also like hopefully meet you in person. On Friday we are planning a dinner, and 436 01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:29.640 Ivy Mentors: that would be awesome. Thank you very much, Jenny, and I think the the Sc. The meetings that we have skipped for. Hold. It's fine. I think we can reschedule them later. That's perfectly fine, so don't worry about them. 437 01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.899 But I think as long as she's making progress we are all good. So 438 01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:34.959 sounds good. 439 01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:38.500 Ivy Mentors: Thank you. Have a nice weekend talk to you soon. Bye, Karen."

This is an MIT course like these are all you know, virtual reality and immersive media production. 367 that's all. Those are all courses at Mit. You could take. Look, I mean she's elated.
