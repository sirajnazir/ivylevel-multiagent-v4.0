00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.770
Jenny Duan: Hi, okay, I will admit. Aj, right now.

2
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.560
Siraj Nazir: Oh, awesome. Yeah. So you you are the host of this right? It's all good.

3
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.739
Siraj Nazir: How are you doing, Jen?

4
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.541
Jenny Duan: Good. I'm good busy. Day.

5
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.440
Siraj Nazir: I can imagine.

6
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.340
Jenny Duan: Hi! Aj nice to meet you.

7
00:01:42.963 --> 00:01:43.810
Ajay: Hi, Jenny!

8
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.460
Jenny Duan: Hi!

9
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.120
Siraj Nazir: Hi, Jay!

10
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.419
Jenny Duan: Oh, there you! Oh.

11
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.590
Jenny Duan: I think the camera's flashing in and out.

12
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.580
Ajay: Yeah, I know.

13
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.130
Jenny Duan: Here we go!

14
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.032
Ajay: Black and white.

15
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.219
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean, it looked very retro.

16
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.069
Ajay: Yes, it's looking black and white.

17
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.989
Ajay: Oh, what's going on?

18
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.800
Ajay: It's a default setting. Right? Yeah.

19
00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:13.179
Ajay: is it changing computers today?

20
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.364
Siraj Nazir: Okay, might be.

21
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:18.770
Ajay: Yeah, yeah, the computer is like your settings.

22
00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.370
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, that's all right. I mean, it gives a very nostalgic and retro.

23
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.420
Ajay: About that perfect.

24
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.220
Siraj Nazir: And that's okay. That's perfect.

25
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.110
Ajay: Okay, yeah, we have nothing with them. Yeah.

26
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.076
Siraj Nazir: Amazing thanks a lot for your time Aj, so nice to meet you.

27
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.200
Siraj Nazir: and

28
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.990
Siraj Nazir: I hope you're all doing good. Had a good weekend.

29
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.040
Siraj Nazir: They're.

30
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.202
Ajay: Yes, we did.

31
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.749
Siraj Nazir: Okay, I think there is some kind of delay, too, but that's perfectly fine, and feel free to also, like, you know.

32
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.079
Ajay: Oh! Is there a delay?

33
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.120
Siraj Nazir: Th there was just like one. I'm just like, just a caution there, but it's fine. I mean, you can also like turn up the you know the video, I'll turn off the video. So probably there's more bandwidth, anyway.

34
00:02:57.404 --> 00:03:05.939
Ajay: I don't think it's a bandwidth problem. I mean, if you have a problem after a while, let me know and switch the cameras to the to the laptop camera.

35
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:20.529
Siraj Nazir: Okay, no, no worries, I think. Yeah, it's always good to have. You know, facetime. thanks a lot again, you know for interesting. And you know, starting with our service. As I said, it's actually really, the goal of this particular.

36
00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:23.762
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, this is, this is one better, and we are back to like

37
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.672
Siraj Nazir: 2024.

38
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.890
Ajay: Yeah. Changed. It to.

39
00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:30.529
Siraj Nazir: Is. I'm busy.

40
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.560
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, thanks a lot.

41
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:50.160
Siraj Nazir: So I think the goal is very clear. Like as I said, right you know we are again, you know, a prep service. And we really believe, like what we have created with. You know, long term, the effect and impact and outcome, we are able to deliver. The only reason we have this basic plan

42
00:03:50.160 --> 00:04:08.479
Siraj Nazir: is to really show it to our new prospects and customers rather than telling and presenting them. So I think really, it's an opportunity in the next 2 weeks for you to also like, you know, look at like. You know how we are different, and what kind of value that we are, and how we approach, what's our approach, and how what it means for your child

43
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:26.150
Siraj Nazir: and your goals and plans and and and growth, but also for us to give an opportunity to look at, you know. Our, you know is, is there a good fit for us to to be able to like? Help your student as well as we are also very selective on how we go about, you know, identifying students that we can really help. And and and of course we are very motivated in helping

44
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:42.200
Siraj Nazir: now the the goal of this particular session. This is the first session, and we have again, like co-created this with our parents. After a lot of learnings and experience, we used to have it like a week, and parents asked us that one week is not enough. Please expand it and extend it to 2 weeks.

45
00:04:43.384 --> 00:05:01.710
Siraj Nazir: you know. And what we do today is I'm gonna introduce, like Jenny will introduce herself, and she'll give you more idea. But really, the goal of today's session is to really go in, you know, to the 5 wise and understand. You know your son as to who he is, which is critically important.

46
00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:13.439
Siraj Nazir: For college prep. And outcomes too. Right? So it is really a a, you know, an art and a science that you will see like happening. And I think we are just like fly on the wall where where we're gonna really listen in. And

47
00:05:13.703 --> 00:05:40.809
Siraj Nazir: there's gonna be a lot of great insights that are gonna come out and of course Jenny's gonna have. While she's doing all of this. She also has the kind of game plan that outcome in her mind back of, you know, behind the scene, without really even letting you know about it. And what will come out of this particular session is an initial draft of a game plan that we have drafted, that we have actually a very curated and very specialized process plan that will come out during the week we are able to ask a few more things.

48
00:05:40.830 --> 00:06:00.430
Siraj Nazir: and of course I know there are top of mind pain points that every parent has. It's every parents number one summer plans. Ap course, selection school strategy. So don't worry about that. The only reason we don't want to add that is because it dilutes away the core thing that we are looking for. Right? So I just want to have a word of caution. We have tried that in the past.

49
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:25.757
Siraj Nazir: What it happens, is unfortunately adding a lot of immediate questions, takes away the entire kind of value of this particular. So we let basically, like Jenny, drive it. But rest assured every question that you have will be answered during the whole week, so I hope just to set the stage there and just have fun and enjoy. Don't feel like you're put on the spot. It's really between you and Jenny. Get to know her, and you know, let's just like, see how how it happens. Thanks a lot, Jenny.

50
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.489
Ajay: Thank you. Thank you. Thanks so much.

51
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:52.506
Jenny Duan: Amazing. So I'll provide a little bit more context and structure. So I'll introduce myself. Then I'd love to learn a little bit more about you. Aj, and then we can just have an open conversation. Yeah. So I'm Jenny. I'm currently a sophomore at Stanford, where I'm majoring in Cs psychology and philosophy, and I focus on human centered. AI I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, but of course, now I live in the Bay Area for school.

52
00:06:53.016 --> 00:06:59.290
Jenny Duan: I'd love to learn a little bit more about you. Aj. If you could share, maybe where you're from, what grade you're in and what school you go to.

53
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:05.464
Ajay: Oh, so it's auto. So I'm I'm rj, I'm auto is the is the.

54
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.510
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I'm so sorry.

55
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:16.680
Ajay: Yeah. So we live in San Jose, California. I go to a private school called BA Basis Independent School, Silicon Valley, and I'm in eighth grade.

56
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.630
Jenny Duan: Amazing based in Silicon Valley. I know a lot of people who actually went there. You're planning to go there for high school as well.

57
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.649
Ajay: Yeah, we are deciding between 2 high schools, Bellarmine and bases. So.

58
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:50.379
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's actually something. Maybe we can start by talking about the high school selection, since I know that it's pretty important and also probably approaching the time when you need to decide. So I'd love to hear like, what do you like about basis? And what are you? What? Why are you considering switching? I'm pretty familiar with basis. So I understand, like how the system works, how it's very competitive. And and all of that.

59
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.730
Ajay: And also learn.

60
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.109
Jenny Duan: Your thought, process.

61
00:07:53.110 --> 00:08:21.390
Ajay: Yes, so the original, like, I wanted to go to basis. But since we have Bellarmine now since I got to Bellarmine, we're still we're trying to compare these 2 schools to say which one would be better for me, and which one would be better for like colleges later in the next 4 years. So the reason why I'm leaning towards basis right now at the moment, cause like the teachers, the the infrastructure they give you for learning and

62
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.210
Ajay: and helping you learn

63
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.670
Ajay: things you want to learn, and giving

64
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:43.220
Ajay: a lot of emphasis on like important topics. And when I shout shadowed development, I did not really see that compared like the teaching quality compared to basis. So that's why I'm really

65
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.270
Ajay: inclined to basis.

66
00:08:46.800 --> 00:09:07.479
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Is Bellerman Bellerman is that's a private Catholic school, right? Jesuit school. Okay? Cool. I also went to a Jesuit high school in Portland, Oregon, I went to Jesuit High School in Oregon, so I I'm also pretty familiar with how the Jesuit system works. So it's all boys, Jesuit private school? And

67
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:15.299
Jenny Duan: I guess, why did you decide to apply to Bellerman? I'm curious, because it feels like you like basis. So why did you decide to apply to Bellerman.

68
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:24.509
Ajay: Oh, so this is my first year in basis. So before this, I had went for like almost 10 years to school in Challenger

69
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.209
Ajay: right. And then first year, and this year I transfer to basis. So I

70
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:44.961
Ajay: what's I was in basis. I really liked all of these things, the teachers, the qualities right. But originally we wanted to apply to Bellarmid, because that was like really

71
00:09:45.680 --> 00:10:02.030
Ajay: a good institution. And my friends were all going to apply there and like their brothers and sisters. Well applied. Our brothers. Yeah. Well applied there. So that's what that's why we really apply development.

72
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.480
Ajay: The first place.

73
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:20.859
Jenny Duan: Got it. I'm curious. Oh, I'm curious about what your experience that basis is like. So I know you really like it. You like your teachers? How has the environment at basis been like for you? Have you been able to make friends? Do you like? I know it's super competitive. So does it feel like, it's very stressful to you, or does it feel okay?

74
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:38.970
Ajay: Well, right now. It doesn't feel too bad like I've been able to make friends. It is more stressful definitely than Challenger. But by the way, challenges is the school which he went earlier. It's it was also a private school.

75
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.527
Ajay: Yeah, I said that.

76
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:41.850
Ajay: Yeah.

77
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:42.570
Jenny Duan: Product.

78
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.399
Ajay: Yeah, so that's why, yeah.

79
00:10:46.820 --> 00:11:10.759
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think that these are all really, really good options. I know that Bellerman is also a very good like college preparatory school. So is basis. Basis is a very strong academic school, I think. For me, the main difference between Bellarmid and basis having gone to a Jesuit school myself is just, I think basis is going to push you to be a little bit more competitive. And it's going to be with a lot of these more traditional like

80
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:35.559
Jenny Duan: Bay area, like really, academically motivated kids. And that can be a very supportive and nurturing environment beller. Mean. Instead, it's going to be a more individualized experience. I don't think it'll be as competitive, but I do think that it will be a little bit more supportive. But, on the other hand. Bellarmament is an All boys school. It's also a Catholic school. So there are those involvements in in it, too, and I think those are the main considerations, though in terms of the atmosphere.

81
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:47.139
Jenny Duan: So I think for yourself personally, what type of atmosphere do you feel like? You will be able to thrive better in a more individualized experience? Or would you like to be with more competitive kids who might push you to

82
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.309
Ajay: We're out there.

83
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.720
Jenny Duan: Do better.

84
00:11:48.720 --> 00:12:02.940
Ajay: I, I I wanna really be pushed and with surround myself with people who may be better than me, or who can push me to like be better to them. Right? So like, that's the environment that I really want.

85
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:10.600
Jenny Duan: Okay, then it seems like your decision is already made. What's stopping you from choosing basis, or what? Why? Why are you still hung up on Bella.

86
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:34.580
Ajay: Because, like most of my friends, are going to Bellarmine and like, there's the infrastructure. I I I think, from he, he's being very clear that he wanted to go to basis initially, was all about Bellarmine. He didn't like that. We made a switch to basis in the eighth grade because he was always wanted to go to Bellarmine, and that was one of the reasons we still applied. So that's still an option

87
00:12:34.933 --> 00:12:50.236
Ajay: and and also the fact that it allows him to also test him, so that whether he can get selected in in the high school but at this point what we are trying to. And that's the reason we are having this right at the end of the day. We it's also being a little strategic.

88
00:12:50.854 --> 00:13:09.616
Ajay: We know that we really like how the philosophy of basis is. And that's the reason we went and said, Let's go to basis in the eighth grade, because it enables him to understand their philosophy of how they teach, and then it helps him be ready for the high school.

89
00:13:10.355 --> 00:13:13.640
Ajay: But what we are trying to figure out is.

90
00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:21.220
Ajay: there is always the competition within the school, and that's also one of the considerations of your college application.

91
00:13:21.787 --> 00:13:31.719
Ajay: Will we be at at any, at any point, it disadvantage of going to a very competitive school, which, even though we have all the benefits of

92
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.463
Ajay: better learning.

93
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:37.629
Ajay: deep understanding of the concepts

94
00:13:37.975 --> 00:14:02.430
Ajay: and then pushing themselves harder to be more ready for the college courses, because they also have a capstone projects research projects which is exactly the one they're preparing them. Even though it's not sometimes not for a college application it could be. But they're preparing them to be easily transition to college. But the downside of that would be that there'd be a lot more competition. They have probably 100 students

95
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:18.452
Ajay: in in the class, whereas 400 in another one. And what Ben Armen has is. As you said, it's more individual, not everyone is looking for stem. There's a lot more varied interest with the with the cohorts is getting into. So the competition could be

96
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:33.339
Ajay: lesser than what it would be in in basis. So we're trying to balance on. We are also leaning towards basis because of the other things I talked about. Yeah, at the end of the day. It might be a little disadvantage in terms of being competitive.

97
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.370
Ajay: but

98
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:40.219
Ajay: I wanted we wanted to reflect that, and discuss, to see

99
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:55.990
Ajay: wh. What? What would that be? And after you hearing from him, or what kind of student is, maybe you come up with a little bit of your own opinion, and that's the background. Right both. You cannot go wrong. But definitely, if I were to go I would like to go to basis.

100
00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:05.369
Ajay: because, initially, is a very sport sports person. I was surprised that when I took him to this the shadowing.

101
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:20.250
Ajay: I thought he would say, No, Daddy, I'll go to basis. Sorry Bella may not basis, but he was other way on. I'm gonna stick with basis, which was a really surprising for us when when he did that. And I asked him why? He said, because

102
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:39.102
Ajay: there are some concepts in physics I was struggling to understand, and this is really help me understand the concept. But also help me really get interesting to those areas. Yeah, like, my previous school didn't really teach these top. We didn't have like a separate subject for physics, chemistry

103
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:59.529
Ajay: like biology all in one year. So to be able to learn all of these new concepts in that year and Spanish, we don't have Spanish, and to learn a language, part of the language at least. And these new concepts, these new subjects, and one year is really helpful. So the other. Another reason we were thinking about is, and we also talked to a few people where

104
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.720
Ajay: their their kids

105
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:10.450
Ajay: for entry to Bellarmine and basis. One kid went to Bellarmine. One Korean basis at the end we were looking at Overall. Wahaara is as an individual.

106
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.340
Ajay: is he? Is he? Can he manage things on his own

107
00:16:14.864 --> 00:16:18.679
Ajay: or he needs a structure which enables him to

108
00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:22.759
Ajay: have a more structured curriculum

109
00:16:23.173 --> 00:16:42.840
Ajay: basis. You gotta be a little bit more self motivated, and because they don't offer all the there's no admin doesn't require all the Ap's to be as part of the curriculum, one or 2, whereas basis as 4 or 5, which is, I know you can take as many, but as part of the getting

110
00:16:43.206 --> 00:17:01.879
Ajay: into graduating, they force you to take 4 ap, so 4 or 5 Ap's minimum so that's kind of where we were thinking that it probably suits our mall basis suits auto because of the way. He's his personality is. So that's kind of one of the reason

111
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:13.550
Ajay: for us to think about basis. However, having said all of those the competitiveness. I think he will probably be much more in the top of the class in Bellarmine.

112
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:28.630
Ajay: but it requires a lot of effort to be similar ranking. I know a lot of people say they don't see ranking, but at the end of the day I think they have figured out how to see the ranking within the same cohorts. And that's where we think you'd be a lot more stressed

113
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.580
Ajay: to be in that higher rank in basis.

114
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:50.469
Jenny Duan: Right? Okay, let's come back to this at the end. I wanna get to know a little bit better and ask a couple of questions, and then I'll give my final recommendation and some further thoughts at the end. I'm curious. First, I just want to start off with asking you. I'm curious what classes you're enrolled in right now, and what you're planning to take next year. In general.

115
00:17:50.670 --> 00:18:02.759
Ajay: Yeah, for sure. So this year I'm taking chemistry like back chemistry. 8, all of those eighth grade, chemistry, biology, physics, Spanish, one B algebra. 2

116
00:18:05.379 --> 00:18:06.899
Ajay: logic held

117
00:18:08.056 --> 00:18:10.400
Ajay: English, English and history.

118
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.630
Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. And what are you planning to take next year?

119
00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:17.759
Ajay: So next year honors English

120
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:24.499
Ajay: ap Us. Government that honors physics pre-talk ab

121
00:18:25.507 --> 00:18:31.750
Ajay: it. Spanish Spanish to Spanish, one B. Spanish. 2. Right? And

122
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.510
Ajay: yeah, the elective would be intro to business.

123
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.910
Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. Apus gov is, is is that normal for freshman to take at.

124
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.870
Ajay: Yeah, yeah, like, it's, it's it's mandated. It's mandatory.

125
00:18:44.870 --> 00:19:09.649
Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, cool and then I would say for Spanish, I would definitely encourage you to keep the Spanish up for all 4 years of high school. I know it might be common to drop your language after the second year, but actually, a lot of colleges prefer or recommend 4 years of foreign language. So I think, planning ahead. It's just good to be aware of that right now. I know Stanford. I think they recently dropped the recommended to maybe 3, but when I applied, Stanford

126
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:23.420
Jenny Duan: was strongly recommended. 4 years of foreign language, education, and many of the top schools place an emphasis on foreign language, which isn't something that is generally known. So make sure that you keep your foreign language up, at least until you complete the Ap. Level.

127
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.800
Jenny Duan: I think that's how we're tip.

128
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:32.720
Ajay: Yeah, I think. But that's a good thing about this is they have the first, second, third year of schools, and then a capstone. In the fourth year.

129
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:43.210
Ajay: Whereas Bellarmine has only first first and second year. Do you do you think that taking the Ap. Language would be helpful for college?

130
00:19:43.520 --> 00:20:04.620
Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely make sure that you take an 8, I would say, actually, it's should be something that you emphasize just as much as ap English or Ap. Math. I think foreign language is very valuable if you can take it also, if you go to a top school, or if you go to any school having a foreign language. Requirement done is is effective, because then you don't have to take it in college, and you can save your credits for other classes that are more interesting.

131
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.910
Ajay: Change. Yeah, okay.

132
00:20:06.135 --> 00:20:12.229
Jenny Duan: So I see you're taking the intro to business next year. Are you thinking about studying business? Is this a field that you plan to go into.

133
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.570
Ajay: Oh, well.

134
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:15.180
Ajay: I wanna

135
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.419
Ajay: I won't do programming, but I wanted, like we took enter the business to.

136
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.089
Ajay: As a prerequisite for Decca.

137
00:20:22.762 --> 00:20:51.689
Ajay: So we wanted it. So this is not still finalized. We will. We won't be knowing. This is just a inactive. Yeah, well, it's probably what we're gonna take. So I think the electives we have selected. So I I think that was a pro choice, because beginning, we thought that Deca was one of the important clubs in basis, which is more about a business club. And what and for some reason we thought there was a good to get into that

138
00:20:52.169 --> 00:21:05.399
Ajay: club and prerequisite, for that was introduction to business. And now we, since we are lot more knowledgeable. I think we might wanted to switch that to introduction to programming or something.

139
00:21:06.735 --> 00:21:15.822
Ajay: If if not, okay, then, if we can. If not, it'll become introduction to business.

140
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:26.330
Jenny Duan: I would say so. A couple of thoughts on this. I would say, if you're interested in going into tech I'm curious why you wanna do, Decca, if you have a reason for the why.

141
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:49.989
Ajay: We? We thought at the beginning, yeah, we were not like very sure at that time about this whole process. We just had this in our mind that if you are part of Decca you'd be you'll have an edge. I think it was all about being an extracurricular different than the class work. And one of the reasons behind is tech and business are related because you can only be successful

142
00:21:50.010 --> 00:22:02.239
Ajay: in doing anything in tech, whether launching a company or coming up with your own startup business is one of the things you would. You would want to know about. Why you are doing something

143
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.779
Ajay: intake. I think that that that I thought was a good.

144
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.265
Ajay: The reason why you'd be exposed to both areas of

145
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:23.230
Ajay: being a very well rounded. I mean, if you're thinking about to be an entrepreneur, how do we know that I can be an entrepreneur? Only if I'm getting exposed to business concepts? Right. So I think that was the reason for us to do.

146
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:45.297
Jenny Duan: 100%. So a couple of notes here, I think, first of all, this is a good segue for us to start thinking about. Your extracurriculars. But first of all, I do wanna say that with focus on tech and business within the extracurricular scope, it's also important for us. And we'll talk about this a little bit later to focus on activities outside the Pre professional interest, especially because coming from the Bay area and being

147
00:22:45.950 --> 00:23:05.219
Jenny Duan: person a South Asian male interested in Cs. It's very easy to get stereotyped by admissions officers and to get typified because there are so many applicants with similar backgrounds interested in the same things. So that's why it's important for us to use extracurriculars to make you stand out and to stand out. It means not necessarily doing things that everyone else is doing.

148
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:29.930
Jenny Duan: Now, this doesn't mean that Decca is not a good activity. It just means that we we might be able to reconsider what might be more advantageous for you, because a lot of people are going to be going into Decca, which means it's going to be very competitive to get into the club, and if you're interested in going into tech, you're already kind of at a disadvantage with people who have been doing business, their whole life, and their plan is to go into business, so we might need to reconsider whether or not Decca is the best

149
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:54.879
Jenny Duan: path or the best, most advantageous School club for you. And there might be other clubs that were organizations or strategies to help you learn those business skills while being in a comparative it advantage for you, because I feel like Decca might be a comparative disadvantage, because you're going in with people who are pre business, who do want to go into that. And you are maybe using Decca as an opportunity to learn business. But these people are using Deca as an opportunity to demonstrate their aptitude and business.

150
00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:10.619
Jenny Duan: And so, because of that, it might be more advantageous for you to pick a different business related thing that might give a better impact to you. So I'm curious, like, I'd love to learn about why you're interested in technology and why you plan to study like programming or software.

151
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:30.260
Ajay: Well, well, I've liked coding like ever since, like first grade, right? Doing a lot of computer fairs and projects like, I really like solving problems with code. And that's why I really want to pursue a career in Cs.

152
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:43.450
Jenny Duan: Yeah. What types of what type of coding do you like? Do you like more of the research aspect? Do you like building apps and websites. Do you like problem solving and algorithms? Or what aspect of computer science to know.

153
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.570
Ajay: Well, like

154
00:24:44.730 --> 00:25:14.519
Ajay: problems talk like an algorithms. Because right now, I'm in a club of machine learning. And data science. And right now, we, we did 2 projects. And we created an AI model to help predict multiple like, if something has disease based off a data set, and we trained the model to make it more accurate, so that one was really nice and fun to do. And I really like doing that. So those are mostly the reasons why.

155
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.160
Ajay: Go see? It's super cool. So.

156
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:25.750
Jenny Duan: I think right off the bat. I want to get you started into doing research because it seems like this is an area that you're interested in at school, you like building algorithms to help

157
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:50.049
Jenny Duan: solve different issues. And so I think, starting in freshman year of high school, it would be great to get you on some type of research project, so that you, have the opportunity to publish some papers or make some contribution in research in the future and so on. The common application. You get room for about 10 extra curriculars. That's the amount of extra curriculars that most people tend to fill within their high school experience, and usually the

158
00:25:50.050 --> 00:26:07.200
Jenny Duan: ratio that people fill. And this isn't a hard ratio. This is just a general guideline that many successful applicants use is about 2 or 3 pre-professional clubs. 2 or 3 community service or impact related clubs. And then 2 or 3 things that demonstrate your leadership and other personal qualities. So

159
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:34.319
Jenny Duan: within that scope of pre professional clubs. I think that doing pre professional sort of activities, I think that doing some type of research would be really interesting for you. And then we can talk about the research area in a little bit. But I think doing some type of computer science research. It seems like it aligns with what you're doing with the Machine Learning Club. And that seems like a good fit for you. I'm also wondering, have you ever tried competitive programming? Or do you know what competitive programming is?

160
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.890
Ajay: Yeah, I know what it is, but we I've never really tried it before.

161
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:47.679
Jenny Duan: Do you know if basis, either basis or Bellarmine? Do you know, if it has, like a competitive programming team like some a team that competes in the Acsl or Usaco competitions.

162
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.020
Ajay: I don't think it has its own team. I think

163
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.899
Ajay: you can team up with others in your school, but it doesn't have its own official team.

164
00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.239
Jenny Duan: Okay, this is really cool, I think.

165
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.019
Jenny Duan: maybe this is a good opportunity for you to start like

166
00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:17.279
Jenny Duan: a a new club. Either of these schools like, if there's not exist an existing team, this is an opportunity for you to take leadership and start your own thing if you like. Competitive programming. Have you ever tried competitive programming at all? Or have you just heard it.

167
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.849
Ajay: Just heard it.

168
00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:23.220
Jenny Duan: Okay. Do you know what? Do you know what leak code is? Your parents probably know what this.

169
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.220
Ajay: Forecasting.

170
00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:24.540
Jenny Duan: You know.

171
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.340
Ajay: Yes, street code. Yes.

172
00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:28.950
Ajay: no.

173
00:27:29.608 --> 00:27:36.480
Ajay: he doesn't know so he's been very, very active and

174
00:27:37.168 --> 00:27:39.709
Ajay: piano and basketball until

175
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:57.009
Ajay: last piano is continuing. Basketball has been something has been very, very active in the last 79 until like this year starting this year, so used to spend a lot of time practice games every weekend tournament. So

176
00:27:57.529 --> 00:28:11.170
Ajay: I think that's one of the reasons why he he didn't enter into many other activities which takes time as well but now, based on his his interest, and I think he won one or 2 competitions.

177
00:28:11.532 --> 00:28:29.677
Ajay: this school as well, and for for. So I I think we started to show that interest. I it's been very hard to kind of understand what's our interests are, but it seems like he's coming back with, Hey, this is what something I'm interested in.

178
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:38.319
Ajay: But I I think you're absolutely right. He's he's not being like, okay. I need to be competitive. I need to do this. Just because he he

179
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.896
Ajay: hardly has had any time.

180
00:28:41.370 --> 00:29:06.170
Jenny Duan: Alright, yeah. And time management is the most challenging thing. And for our long term students, one of the first exercises we do is we call it 1 68 h, where 168 h is the number of hours in a week. So something we do with our long term students is, we actually break down every single hour and see like, where are people spending their time? Are people spending like we found in some students? They spend like 15 HA week, maybe, on social media or 8 HA week, playing video games and

181
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:22.419
Jenny Duan: in high school. It's all about the balance of time, both both leaving time for rest, but also making sure that you know at least where your time is going. And so definitely you bring up such an important point. I'm curious about this interest in basketball. That's super cool. Are you planning to continue in high school

182
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.349
Jenny Duan: like I'm trying out for the school team?

183
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:37.660
Ajay: Okay, he was in the school basis. Yes. But yeah, I'm probably gonna travel the school team in basis and in basis and delivering. I'm probably gonna try.

184
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.560
Ajay: I am. Do you know how.

185
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.450
Jenny Duan: Do you know how hard or how good the teams are at basis in Belgium?

186
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:59.479
Ajay: Environment. Of course, it's really, really good, like, there's a lot of people there with with good skills. But basis has not as a professional athletic team as bellerman. But there still is a team.

187
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.960
Jenny Duan: Do you plan to play in college at all?

188
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.680
Jenny Duan: Do you want to play in college?

189
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.850
Ajay: No snow.

190
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:11.529
Jenny Duan: Okay, then, I think this is a point towards basis, because you, it's good to be like the best player on. Not so good of a team.

191
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:27.100
Jenny Duan: And I think that if you're like, if you're able to make varsity either your freshman or sophomore year, even if the team is not good just being on Varsity is impressive in and of itself, and you don't really need to have that good of a team if you're not playing to get scouted, so it doesn't like. So the quality of the team.

192
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:46.849
Jenny Duan: It's if it's more about having fun for you, then I think you'll have more of an opportunity to demonstrate your skills and your leadership. Organizing the team that basis by getting a varsity position earlier. Just because it's less competitive than probably Bellarmine is so. Okay, I see that. And piano. Can you tell me a bit about how long you've been playing piano, and to the extent of your involvement with piano.

193
00:30:47.070 --> 00:31:02.869
Ajay: Yeah. So I started playing piano for many years. I'm 5 years old. I I took. I did. Yeah, I did piano for some years, and then I took a break from 6 seventh grade, 6, fifth to sixth grade, Covid and everything, and

194
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:20.030
Ajay: scheduling issues. But I started restarted again from 6 seventh grade. And now I'm in level 6. I'm taking the level 6 exam. This this year and planning to take level 8 exam. Cm. Level 8 exam. In high school.

195
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.140
Ajay: Ninth grade. Yeah. Ninth.

196
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.740
Jenny Duan: Got it. And then do you plan to finish up level 10 by the end of high school.

197
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.300
Ajay: Yes, yes, that is the goal. Here is.

198
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:51.409
Jenny Duan: I was also a pianist, so I can emphasize. I can empathize with like having to practice all of those pieces and memorizations, and I think for me, I was always think that you're training in the music theory. That was hard. But maybe that comes naturally to you. I'm not sure. You know, if you plan to play at your school like, is there an opportunity for you to play piano in a band, or in like

199
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:52.790
Jenny Duan: orchestra, or something.

200
00:31:52.790 --> 00:32:02.070
Ajay: Well, there, no, not really. There's like piano course, but like they teach you everything. There are recitals. But I don't think that will really do anything

201
00:32:02.606 --> 00:32:06.979
Ajay: you could play externally if we can. But yeah, not in school, but.

202
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.850
Jenny Duan: Coming in.

203
00:32:08.475 --> 00:32:21.600
Ajay: Sorry Bellamy has a very good it has, but it does only for string instruments, mostly for string instruments.

204
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.380
Jenny Duan: Got it? For piano.

205
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:29.745
Jenny Duan: Do you compete in any piano competitions or local music festivals.

206
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.660
Ajay: Yeah, definitely. So I competed in many of

207
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:36.000
Ajay: the In program

208
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:45.317
Ajay: recitals, and he was selected for honing that I was selected for on recitals multiple times. So yeah.

209
00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:56.960
Ajay: it's not like, really a competition. But yeah, inside this, inside the school, they just pick up, pick a few kids for honor recitals.

210
00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.230
Jenny Duan: Cool do you

211
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.590
Jenny Duan: play jazz, or just classical.

212
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:02.860
Ajay: Discuss.

213
00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.909
Ajay: Yeah, we're including maybe one or 2 like jazz pieces, of course, cause like

214
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:15.710
Ajay: the Cm requires a chat piece in eighth, ninth tenth level, but really just classical.

215
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:26.559
Jenny Duan: Okay? So besides, basketball, piano, and this machine learning club, how else do you spend your time? What are some of the other activities that you can, that you do.

216
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.315
Ajay: Tomorrow.

217
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:35.197
Ajay: Well, those activities take up really most of my time

218
00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:51.589
Ajay: like and like with the rigor and basis now and private school, I I these 3 main extra curriculars, or what I spend most of my time.

219
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.513
Jenny Duan: Got it

220
00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.680
Jenny Duan: and

221
00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:14.420
Jenny Duan: so we can think about what kind of extra curriculums you want to start in high school, because, to be honest. What you do in eighth grade doesn't really make that much of an impact on the scope of your applications, anyways. So I think now is a good time to start thinking about and planning ahead for high school. So we already know that you're going to. So.

222
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:39.050
Jenny Duan: But basically, I'm reconstructing your common app 10 activities from the ground up. So we're talking about eventually, when you're applying for college, you get 10, a activity slots and we're gonna fill those in starting now, and obviously you can. This is subject to change, but it's good to be prepared with a plan. Moving forward. So first thing I put down is research. I think that research is going to be something that you will find personally valuable based on what you've said.

223
00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:58.349
Jenny Duan: And also your interest. So doing, some type of computer science research compute combining computer science with an impact area that you're passionate about. And we'll get into the impact area later on. But an impact area is basically like some field. For example, people focus on the environment, on public health, on you know.

224
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:24.010
Jenny Duan: Internet, safety other things, but something that shows that what you're doing or what you're learning is going to be applied to the real world in some way and most schools and most like organizations, really want people who will become leaders and who will change the world in some way. And so having a defined impact area is important for that reason. So we have research. There's also competitive programming. That I mentioned earlier. And then

225
00:35:24.794 --> 00:35:38.509
Jenny Duan: I think that beyond that, I really think that you're a good public speaker, and it seems like you're very articulate. So I would love to see you in some type of leadership positions at school. Do you know, if you'd be able to run for student government or something like that at basis.

226
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:47.730
Ajay: Sadly, there is no student like formal student government and basis. There's like leadership positions you could take in clubs. But that's really it.

227
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:53.667
Jenny Duan: Why isn't there? Is there no like student body that plans, for example, promcoming.

228
00:35:54.060 --> 00:36:04.009
Ajay: All done by the like. The administration itself, like there are. There are some clubs that have influence in those events

229
00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.659
Ajay: like there's a Key Club

230
00:36:07.288 --> 00:36:14.469
Ajay: as various other clubs like that that influence events. But there's no like whole student body in basis.

231
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.270
Jenny Duan: Know if that's been an effort that people have tried to start in the past.

232
00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:20.240
Ajay: Like.

233
00:36:21.452 --> 00:36:31.300
Ajay: No, I think so. Cause like I think the Mac admit, like the administrators, the like the school teachers, and

234
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.339
Ajay: every everybody else would they want to

235
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.649
Ajay: plan different? Not.

236
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:47.324
Ajay: There's something he can check check with the school, but I think it's a very low probability.

237
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.930
Jenny Duan: I see. Okay, got it?

238
00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.090
Jenny Duan: And

239
00:36:52.230 --> 00:37:01.150
Jenny Duan: another thing. So if there's no school leadership, maybe we can do leadership in other clubs. Are there other clubs that you find interesting at your school.

240
00:37:03.462 --> 00:37:05.390
Ajay: Well, there are other

241
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.900
Ajay: programming clubs like

242
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:27.424
Ajay: as well as this for other languages, for other programming languages. Of course it's an American Cross Club as well. There are many, many, over 100 200 clubs.

243
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:33.440
Ajay: Well, of course we could do some volunteer clubs. I could take interest to.

244
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:55.140
Jenny Duan: Okay, I would say, let's not do any volunteer clubs, because the thing with volunteering is, I think, a misconception. Is that what matters is the number of hours. But I think what is more important is your tangible impact in your leadership in an organization. And I feel like a lot of the times when people do volunteer clubs. They're basically just like a body helping out

245
00:37:55.388 --> 00:38:06.339
Jenny Duan: and putting in a number of hours. But I think colleges actually don't really care about that. And it's more about what type of impact and leadership you can take on. So I think, instead of doing a volunteer club. Let's see it. What?

246
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:14.650
Jenny Duan: When we talk about your impact area in a couple of minutes, let's see, like what local nonprofits you might be able to get involved in and what kind of leadership positions you might be able to take on there.

247
00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:36.610
Jenny Duan: So I think that having the research, the competitive programming. And then I think, let's add, like, summer program will also be on your activities list at some point when you get to your junior year of high school. You'll have the opportunity to apply for some pretty competitive summer programs like, for example, Rsi, Ssp, other other pretty impressive engineering programs. And

248
00:38:36.892 --> 00:39:01.230
Jenny Duan: that's definitely gonna count as an activity on your list. But it'll also be an opportunity for you to learn more about stem. So I think that crosses off some of our 3 like pre professional types of clubs, or activities. I am really interested in developing your public speaking and your leadership. Further, because I do feel like this is a natural strength for you like, I feel like you're very well spoken and that doesn't. Obviously not. Every student has that choice

249
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:10.969
Jenny Duan: great. So I know that you were thinking about Deco before. Are there any other clubs that you think you'd be interested in, similar to deco where you get to do a lot of public speaking, for example, speech and debate at the explore.

250
00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:22.279
Ajay: But there is speaking debate in both basis, and Bellerman Bellerman has a really really good speaking debate. Team basis. The it is there, but not as much.

251
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:34.616
Ajay: But like, yeah, that's one of the top things people want to look for in base Bellerman as well. But yeah, there is a speech in debate team that you can do and take leadership in there as well, mainly.

252
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.520
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like, okay at Bellarmine, though, and with speech and debate specifically, if you.

253
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.459
Ajay: They also have a public sorry. They also have a public speaking class

254
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.309
Ajay: as well, so I don't know if that helps. But.

255
00:39:48.520 --> 00:40:07.480
Jenny Duan: Okay, I would say, public speaking club probably not necessary. Because I think that probably just teaches you how to give speeches. But the best way to give speeches is actually just to go out there in the world and give speeches instead of joining a club that teaches you how to do that. So I think that would not be the best use of your time. And I think

256
00:40:08.763 --> 00:40:18.129
Jenny Duan: in terms of speech and debate. If this is a path that you intend to continue on. It does. Speech and debate does require a significant time investment to be successful.

257
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:18.730
Ajay: Yeah.

258
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:36.019
Jenny Duan: Not really something that you can just join a club and be good, like typically people who do speech and debate, spend their summers at speech and debate cams. They might have private debate coaches like it's quite an investment in time and energy, and so I would spend some time thinking about that, and maybe not immediately rush in. But one thing I think you can do is

259
00:40:36.548 --> 00:40:50.770
Jenny Duan: there's lots of boards that you can join, and I feel like if you're so, if it's hard to get leadership at your school in a student government position, it's hard to join an existing like speech and debate Daca type of club just because of how hyper competitive they are.

260
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:59.719
Jenny Duan: But I do feel like you should join. Consider joining like a local board or a nonprofit board, or something like that. So what county do you live in?

261
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.900
Ajay: Santa Clara.

262
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.180
Jenny Duan: Santa Clara County.

263
00:41:03.533 --> 00:41:09.796
Jenny Duan: So a lot of the times. Local governments will have youth advisory boards. So let me just do a quick

264
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:19.770
Jenny Duan: search for that, and that will be an opportunity for you to take leadership in your community by representing your city or your community on like a public in a public space.

265
00:41:20.436 --> 00:41:22.619
Jenny Duan: So give me a second.

266
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.859
Jenny Duan: Okay, I just found it. So

267
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.640
Jenny Duan: Santa Claire County has something called the

268
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:40.971
Jenny Duan: Youth Commission. I just put it in the in the chat. But it's a 15 member. It's a 15 Member Commission, and they give advice to

269
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:45.800
Jenny Duan: Santa Clara County leaders to talk about and make decisions.

270
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:54.682
Jenny Duan: So you can see, like people from here, go to all different places. They go to Cupertino High School, Santa Clara High School, Saint Francis High School.

271
00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:05.130
Jenny Duan: other things, and I think for you to join something like it doesn't necessarily have to be this Youth Commission. This is just the first example that I found. But to take impact in your community

272
00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:25.180
Jenny Duan: in this way can be an impactful way for you to develop your leadership, your public speaking, because you'll need to be giving speeches to the boards and also to people in your community. Well, also doing something that's different cause. I think you hear a lot of people doing Deca. You hear a lot of people doing speech and debate, but not everyone is on like a Youth City Commission. And so when we're looking at your extracurriculars.

273
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:38.099
Jenny Duan: we're trying to be as strategic as possible. So do things. So the principles that we're using here are, do things that other people don't do, that you could have the highest impact leadership and comparative advantage in.

274
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:54.989
Jenny Duan: And that's the way that we isolate the extracurriculars, because, again, from your background, it's very easy to be stereotyped, and it's very easy to be kind of have a cookie cutter profile, but we don't want that. And so we wanna look for opportunities like this that are unique where you have the opportunity to actually make leadership

275
00:42:55.130 --> 00:43:04.800
Jenny Duan: and make an impact is this something that you'd be interested in? And it doesn't have to be this specific commission like we can find other ones. But something like this? Do you find this interesting.

276
00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:08.629
Ajay: Yeah, I think it's pretty interesting, like the com, like

277
00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:20.479
Ajay: providing for helping out in your community and giving speeches that could be like that could get eventually lead to an impact in your community. I think that'd be really interesting.

278
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.700
Ajay: Right? Yeah.

279
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:38.580
Jenny Duan: Yeah. And again, the reason why we're doing this, it's really important to understand the why. Behind everything, I feel like I've been. I've been just saying a lot of things to you, and I know I'm talk. I talk fast, and I know it's a lot to take in, but I know. The reason why we wanna talk about things in this type of framework is

280
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:52.490
Jenny Duan: because, Co, one of the primary mistakes that people make on their college applications is that they think doing a certain set of activities or just doing things will help them get into college. But what colleges really wanna see is your narrative.

281
00:43:52.530 --> 00:44:16.889
Jenny Duan: And so this brings us to the next element of a college application. So besides your res, your resume, and all that things that you've done. They really wanna understand your underlying motivations for why you are pursuing the things that you pursue and what you want to study in the future. But they really wanna know, like, what about your personal background? Your interest makes you a good fit for these extra curriculars, and they wanna know that you genuinely have

282
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:30.228
Jenny Duan: passion for what you do. So the 3 components of a successful college application are aptitude, passion, and impact. So aptitude is, you know, demonstrated through things like your standardized test scores your grades, your letters of recommendation.

283
00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:56.049
Jenny Duan: Passion is brought out, passion and impact. The other 2 components are really brought out through your extracurriculars and the things that you spend your time doing. And they really colleges really wanna understand that you're doing this, not because someone told you to, not because you think that it'll get you into college, but because you genuinely find them valuable. And that's the type of person that colleges wanna admit they don't wanna admit someone with a stacked resume.

284
00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:06.879
Jenny Duan: They wanna admit someone who actually cares about what they do and tries to have an impact in the things that they do. And so, when thinking about a college application, one of my best pieces of advice is.

285
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:29.830
Jenny Duan: you don't want to just get into a college, you wanna become the type of person that goes to that school that you wanna go to, for example, let's say your dream school is mit, for example, you can think, and your dream school might not be Mit. That's just a random school, but you can think like, what are the characteristics of a successful mit applicant. Okay, maybe a successful mit student is hardworking.

286
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:42.808
Jenny Duan: Maybe they have good relationships with their teachers. Maybe they're really smart and good at computer science or engineering or physics or something. But those are the qualities that you wanna take and put them onto yourself.

287
00:45:43.524 --> 00:45:50.990
Jenny Duan: A successful mit student is not just someone who has a high sat score. There's someone who knows how to organize their time

288
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.240
Jenny Duan: effectively, so they can study for 3 months

289
00:45:54.280 --> 00:46:23.639
Jenny Duan: and bring their score up from the starting score to what they end up having. And so that's kind of what I want to impart on you is that within the framework of all the extracurriculars that you spend your time doing to have a purpose for? Why you wanna do this and why, actually matters to you instead of just someone telling you that you need 100 volunteer hours, or that you need to be in Decca, or that you need to be in speech and debate. That's not the point. The point is to find what you're actually passionate about, and then spend time doing that.

290
00:46:24.029 --> 00:46:43.940
Jenny Duan: And so I know, I've been talking a lot. So I wanna bring it back to you. And I think this is a good time to transition into your computer community service and impact areas. So are there any particular causes that you feel particularly drawn to, or that you feel interested in like, what is the biggest problem in the world that you think you would want to solve one day eventually.

291
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.750
Ajay: Wow! Well.

292
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:58.120
Ajay: like, of course, like, eventually, maybe contributing to the end of climate change.

293
00:46:58.350 --> 00:46:58.900
Ajay: you can.

294
00:46:58.900 --> 00:46:59.450
Jenny Duan: I'll be.

295
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:01.440
Ajay: And

296
00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:02.470
Ajay: great.

297
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:03.750
Ajay: I guess.

298
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.159
Ajay: helping other people

299
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:14.139
Ajay: obtain like a better lifestyle, like getting homeless people off the streets and getting into secure job.

300
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:42.060
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think that like, later down the line, climate change is definitely going to be 100%, a very impactful area that you'll wanna spend time cultivating. And so what specifically about climate change do you wanna address? I know climate change is really big. So some students like to focus on, like the Antarctic region. Some people like to focus on food waste. Is there a specific, narrow aspect of climate change that you're interested in. And it's okay. If it's early.

301
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:50.960
Ajay: Yeah, I've never really thought about that. But like I have been seeing how climate change has been affecting our world like damages.

302
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:57.940
Ajay: Our world from previous years using coal and burning gas missions. So I haven't really

303
00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.810
Ajay: like, look taught into what

304
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:04.240
Ajay: part of climate change I want to help fix.

305
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:26.860
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense. I think that climate change is a really good impact area. And like over the years, you'll have more time to think about what specifically you want to focus on. But just as an example. One of my friends from high school. He goes to Harvey Mudd College now. But he was really interested in in climate change, and his research was on measuring how glaciers melt

306
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:46.269
Jenny Duan: with machine learning algorithms and making predictions for the rate of of the rate of like melt, the rate of the glaciers melting, and then how to prevent them. So there are a lot of interesting opportunities for you to combine Cs with climate change. Too, and to to use Cs, not as like

307
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:52.380
Jenny Duan: as to Ucs as a tool to solve problems. I think that's like at the core of of

308
00:48:52.674 --> 00:48:59.820
Jenny Duan: your interest in Cs in the activities that you do should be like applying Cs to solve real problems. Sarah, should you have something to add.

309
00:49:01.946 --> 00:49:11.653
Siraj Nazir: No, I I I'm glad that you know we kind of actually shook gears here, I think. I'll I'll just wait for the moment, you know, I wanted to. Basically, I wanted just like, you know, all of you all to just kind of remember.

310
00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.079
Ajay: I'll be a student.

311
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:18.749
Siraj Nazir: From the what to the why, and then I would love to like kind of highlight, that towards the end please keep continuing.

312
00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:26.160
Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. So the next thing that I'm curious about is just what are you interested in like

313
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:42.699
Jenny Duan: in outside of school, outside of computer science like, what are some of your other? What do you spend your most of your time thinking about? And for some people they think about like video games. Some people like to think about like traveling. Some people are really passionate about something super niche. Would you say that you have a passion like that?

314
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:47.720
Ajay: oh, like

315
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:49.730
Ajay: they do like

316
00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:51.880
Ajay: boot. Great

317
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:59.809
Ajay: enjoy with my friends from time to time. And associate, yeah, talk to people. And like.

318
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:03.140
Ajay: I look forward to like talking to people every day.

319
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:12.560
Ajay: Oh, sorry. Yeah. Being a social person, not really a niche or anything. But really, being a student.

320
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:33.264
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think, for I can already tell that you are quite an empathetic person. And you're also very open to talking to people. And I think that actually, what I found in in my own college life is that you're interpersonal skills, which you seem very skilled at will actually get you very far. And so something that I want to like structure. Your learnings moving forward is that

321
00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:47.116
Jenny Duan: I think, no matter what school you want to go to, and we're gonna get back to the school topic in a second. But I think, no matter what school you choose to go to, I want you to lean into those social skills that you have the public speaking ability in your ability to articulate things

322
00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:50.010
Jenny Duan: because I think that is going to really set you apart.

323
00:50:50.307 --> 00:50:59.242
Jenny Duan: Especially at schools like basis, where I think basis is more home to like the more academic type or the more shy but very like intelligent type of people.

324
00:50:59.803 --> 00:51:21.180
Jenny Duan: And I think that you'll really stand out because you have these leadership skills. And because you can do public speaking, I think, these are gonna be really valuable things. And I want you to hold on to that as you continue in high school. And and I mean, obviously, stem research. And being very sciencey is super important. But I don't want you to lose your public speaking ability, because I feel like that's a big strength of yours.

325
00:51:21.998 --> 00:51:24.190
Jenny Duan: And ultimately, I think, like

326
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:40.773
Jenny Duan: college and doing things is, is not about changing who you are as a person to satisfy a specific set of requirements for college. It's about just trying to be the best that you can, irrespective of colleges, and then having the colleges recognize that as a result.

327
00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:55.770
Jenny Duan: but yeah, back to the back to the high school. Topic. I've gotten the chance over the past hour to kind of get to know you better and to learn about what you're interested in and how you spend your time. So what I wanna say about colleges is, I think.

328
00:51:56.038 --> 00:52:19.401
Jenny Duan: another advantage that I think we haven't talked about with Bellerman. Is the network of people, I think will be really valuable in teaching you a lot, because one of the most valuable things about college as well is the the people that you're surrounded by. And I think this is something to think about with basis in Bellarmine, like, what kinds of students you wanna be around that being said? That's something I did. Wanna highlight that being said. I do think that

329
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:30.700
Jenny Duan: with the whole leadership aspect, I think basis will will probably help you stand out more in that regard, because I do think that. You know there aren't as many athletes at basis. There aren't as many leaders.

330
00:52:30.983 --> 00:52:53.070
Jenny Duan: But it will be more challenging academically. So I think, in terms of priorities that the admissions officers have first priority is keeping your grades up. If you think that your Gpa. Is going to suffer significantly at basis. I think that's enough of a reason to not go there. But I do think if you're able to keep your Gpa up, this is the number one thing that colleges, admissions, officers look for is your academic preparedness?

331
00:52:53.331 --> 00:53:13.210
Jenny Duan: And standing out academically, because ultimately you are going to college to be a student and to learn. And if you don't demonstrate that you have a good Gpa. Or that you've taken hard classes, or that you're able to survive in a a rigorous environment, then that's not in your favor. So if you think that you can survive academically at basis and do well at basis, I would encourage you to go to basis.

332
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:26.329
Jenny Duan: But if you think that you won't be able to do well at basis then I would say, go to Bellarmine, and I think it really to me the other benefits and the the pros and cons kind of like

333
00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:34.839
Jenny Duan: outweigh other factors at both schools, like both schools have different pros and cons, and you'll benefit in different ways at these different schools. But I think ultimately.

334
00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:57.149
Jenny Duan: because academics are the priority at whatever high school you go to it's just depends on where you think you can. You can do the best, I think that if you're able to maintain good grades at basis that seems like the better fit for you, based on everything that you've said. But if you do think that your grade will, your Gpa. Will drop to below like a 3.8 unweighted. I would not choose to go to basis, and I would go to Bellarmine instead.

335
00:53:57.826 --> 00:54:03.730
Jenny Duan: That's kind of my thoughts. But I'd love to like. Ask you what you're thinking, and see how we can further discuss this.

336
00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.250
Ajay: Yeah, that's been like a topic of discussion in your family as well, like

337
00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:17.370
Ajay: keeping our grades up in that rigorous environment. But I think I I'll be able to do that. And that's why I've been favoring basis this time.

338
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:29.650
Ajay: So yeah, so is that like, I have a question. So on the Gpa. 3.8 means. So he should have an average of 95 plus in all the subjects. Is that right?

339
00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:45.349
Jenny Duan: Oh, no, not necessarily just. I think it depends on so 3 point. So an A is a 4 point. O, so I mean, the goal is probably just try to get straight days every at any school you go to. Maybe like one B or 2 B's is not gonna harm you, but just try to get straight A's wherever you are.

340
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:52.219
Ajay: So when we say unbiased, there are 4, 5, or 6

341
00:54:53.090 --> 00:55:06.449
Ajay: ap courses as part of the curriculum, so if 4, there are 3 there is equal into a 4 in a normal weighted, or that brings unweighted, are that.

342
00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:16.369
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Waiting, I think, are calculated differently. But the point is, no matter what class you're taking, whether that's an Ap. Whether that's normal class try to get an A in the class.

343
00:55:17.332 --> 00:55:20.660
Ajay: Okay. So the email Ap is a file. Correct?

344
00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:24.990
Jenny Duan: Yeah, and that will bring your weighted Gpa. Up. But it doesn't affect your unweight. Gpa.

345
00:55:25.451 --> 00:55:36.520
Ajay: Is that like, if you take one Ap. And you have a 5 of that like one Ap taught your entire high school like

346
00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:43.630
Ajay: when you're studying in high school is, does that bring your Gpa. To a 5, or does it just raise

347
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:55.960
Ajay: raise it like, let's you already have a 4 point of Gpa. In your regular classes, but you only take that one Ap. And you get a 5. How much does that raise your weighted? Gpa. No, you're waited, cause.

348
00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.930
Jenny Duan: It'll take it. It'll take it above a 4 point O to like a 4.1 or something.

349
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:04.950
Ajay: I only will take it to a 4 by one. Right? So so you need to take multiple. Ap's to.

350
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.830
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

351
00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:06.660
Ajay: Okay.

352
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:15.369
Jenny Duan: And then the more Ap. You'll take your your your weight at Gpa. Will average up to like a 4.2. Then 4.3 4.4, and so on, depending on your weighted average.

353
00:56:15.855 --> 00:56:22.350
Ajay: So, Jenny, you said one thing about networking and Bill Armin. Can you please emphasize on that a little bit.

354
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:45.440
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So Bellerman is a I'm gonna say, straightforward. Bellarmine is an expensive called preparatory school. So the people who are sending their children to Bellerman are usually obviously, they're financially doing well. They might be leaders in Silicon Valley. They might be, you know. They have to be successful in your in your career to send your child to Bellarmine, and because of that you might be exposed to people from

355
00:56:45.722 --> 00:56:55.909
Jenny Duan: like different backgrounds, and especially if you wanna work in business like your. Even your high school connections will really matter in the future. That's not to say that basis doesn't have bad connections like

356
00:56:55.910 --> 00:57:20.519
Jenny Duan: basis has great connections, too. It's just different, like, one of the biggest benefits of going to a top school like Stanford is the amount of peers that I'm surrounded by, for example, like Center, for Chai's daughter goes to Stanford. Bill Gates's daughter goes to Stanford. The CEO of Zoom. Eric, yeah. And his son is in my grade at Stanford, and I'm able to interact with these people. And the that network I know will help support me later in life.

357
00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:48.220
Jenny Duan: when we all have careers, and we can all like call each other for help, or we know that, like there are well connected people to draw onto for different things. And that's why Bellerman might expose you to a different group of people that you might have at basis. I think, basis. People are incredibly smart, and you'll have your own great network there, too. But Bellerman, like the type of person, might be a little bit different. If you're not used to interacting with those types of people in everyday life, it could be a good opportunity to learn.

358
00:57:49.137 --> 00:58:09.250
Jenny Duan: But, like also probably get that at the college level, too. So I wouldn't say it's like a top factor, but I think it is like something to be aware of, at least at my High School Jesuit High School in Portland, Oregon. Like Phil Knight, the Nike founders, grandchildren, went to my school, too, and so we have, like a good connection to alumni and other impactful people.

359
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:18.010
Siraj Nazir: Great, I think. Yeah, in the interest of time, you know, just a few things. I wanted to just basically say, to wrap up. I think we've kind of covered a lot

360
00:58:18.348 --> 00:58:29.081
Siraj Nazir: even though I'll be very honest that this was a very different framework, that the reason was because I had a few top of mind that you guys had which I wanted to be addressed. So I think Jenny, very

361
00:58:29.742 --> 00:58:50.190
Siraj Nazir: she tried her best to kind of weave it. But I also see that we kind of really departed from our typical framework way. Right? I think, what Jenny came. We flipped the model in some ways. But I want to really bring out a few points here right again, just to remind our goal. Here again is, how do you get into that Stanford environment? Right? That's what our goal is here to help you. Right?

362
00:58:50.492 --> 00:59:12.689
Siraj Nazir: Absolutely. I think when it comes to other kind of private schools and preparatory schools. Right? I mean, that's not really the goal that we're not really, really like to advise you on that. I mean you can build networks. You can learn a lot. Our outcome that we are focused on, that we want to be in your journey together is to get you in that environment that Jenny gets to enjoy today. And with that the real thing that I want you are of to

363
00:59:13.423 --> 00:59:23.450
Siraj Nazir: there's something with a right, Jenny. I think that's our biggest kind of customer segment. I mean, students are all a students type a so I don't. What I want you to know is number one.

364
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:42.040
Siraj Nazir: All that has been discussed, the thing that will help you eventually, or will be the deciding factor. And you. Where am I talking this from this? I'm talking from our. After having gone through this experience with multiple students, including my own kid plus working with the types of like Jenny on day and day out, basis and lot of seniors.

365
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:42.779
Ajay: Ears.

366
00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:50.240
Siraj Nazir: Then, if in 4 years time, what you're gonna end up in a situation is, how do you? The only question that's gonna matter

367
00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:55.120
Siraj Nazir: is, how are you different? What sets you apart? How are you? Gonna stand out

368
00:59:55.310 --> 01:00:02.839
Siraj Nazir: and let me tell you, this brutal, honest, T. Honestly right doesn't matter which boarding school or private school or preparatory school you go to.

369
01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:11.299
Siraj Nazir: if you are not able to carve out a path and unique way in which you start differentiating and standing out from the word go from day one.

370
01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:41.020
Siraj Nazir: If there's high risk of you pre pretty much becoming a cookie cutter profile, and a sure way to do that is academics obsession. Right? So I think what Jenny actually did to you initially, 30 min is a typical counselor approach. And to be very honest. It's something that you can. Your school, you know your schools like, you know, private schools actually is something you know you can learn about. You know what this academics is? What? Ca, you know a waiter Gpa unweighted Gpa, which courses of which clubs to join that is really the race to the bottom of approach

371
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.670
Siraj Nazir: as as simple as that.

372
01:00:42.710 --> 01:01:09.770
Siraj Nazir: you know, because that's a standard template that every school tries to sell and put put on you right. Come on board, you join. We give you 15 clubs. Nothing harm about it. Th, there's nothing bad about it. It's amazing. It helps you develop a lot of things. You work with teams. You grow, you know, model you. And another thing, right? I mean, what is our cookie cutter profile? You know, everyone's got this, I can show you like every Bay area kind of a profile. Has a model. UN has a Deca has a robotics club.

373
01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:31.980
Siraj Nazir: How do you stand out. It's it's just not possible. So I think it is actually harmful. So what we want to do is really, you see, in the last 20 min. Jenny, kind of gradually, I think what she was trying to show you was initially just trying to understand what you're doing today, and what other things that you are actually are resonating with you. She was just like she was evaluating on how you're responding to different things.

374
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:41.440
Siraj Nazir: Then eventually she kind of started. You know the Segway was into the why. What are you passionate? About? Which cause are you passionate about? That? Is really your narrative.

375
01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:46.010
Siraj Nazir: and if you start looking at every successful student who's made it to Stanford.

376
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:49.980
Siraj Nazir: Their genuine authentic narrative comes out as simple as that

377
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:54.450
Siraj Nazir: we it, and the way they do it is by showing

378
01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:59.740
Siraj Nazir: every activity that they have done, has that DNA and imprint in it.

379
01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:02.869
Siraj Nazir: It cannot be a standard. 2 kicker profile.

380
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:11.240
Siraj Nazir: 15. People are going to do this anyway? Right? So the place where? Why is a college? Why does it take time

381
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:18.259
Siraj Nazir: to work on college prep and an application so long. And why do those students succeed is because

382
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:25.410
Siraj Nazir: they work on 80 20, the biggest items that actually help you stand out eventually your research project that Jenny was talking about

383
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:42.599
Siraj Nazir: your Passion project that Jenny was talking about the community impact project. You see the 10 activity list. If you really think about 10 activity list. In fact, we've already discussed 20 items as I was counting how many things that Jenny was proposing as she was actually full force today. It's there's no harm in it.

384
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:53.479
Siraj Nazir: but that's not going to help you out. A list should be a narrative. It should not be a list is what you're saying it. Everything should connect, like, you know, a web, a nexus.

385
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.729
Siraj Nazir: and tell you who this or like, who is out of

386
01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:02.580
Siraj Nazir: because college admission officer want to see human being. And they really want interesting people.

387
01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:16.079
Siraj Nazir: They do not want academic, heavy people. Even Mit is kind of getting into that that kind of programs that are emerging even mit right with all due respect. The only school. Probably we could have said that you know that they need like super Academician and Research mit

388
01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.030
Siraj Nazir: Stanford. You will be blown away.

389
01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:28.969
Siraj Nazir: you know. I I'll you'll see like our coaches, like, you know, even like Jenny is like everyone does crazy stuff. But they are. So that is where the beauty is, if you are just like. So what we're gonna do is

390
01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:51.069
Siraj Nazir: even though I think in the interest of time. We have given a lot of things. Actually, I do feel. Personally, I feel like if there is no baggage and mandate, I want to decouple that then, you know, Jenny would have gone into very, very. I think the next session probably will do more of why, I think that digging is very important. And most of the times, you know, and 99% of tech Bay area pairs. And and Jenny, you know this right?

391
01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:59.309
Siraj Nazir: We have 2 students. They all want to do cyber security because their parents are Cpos and Svps of cyber security.

392
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:20.169
Siraj Nazir: Right? You start talking to them. Their profile turns out to be something very different. And we basically bridge that gap. I basically talk head on with their parents and tell them that you're actually harming your child the opportunities that he, they can become a cyber security expert down the road. But the path to becoming a cyber security and getting into a top school like Stanford is not to just be fixated with Cs.

393
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:39.760
Siraj Nazir: I'll be. That's another thing. You know, we we have taken that approach like getting. I think it is beyond major. So I think next time out of like you, what we want to do is we will come up with a lot of impre pressing questions. And you know, academic rigor and everything else is absolutely important. Again, it is as Jenny said, it is important, but it is baseline.

394
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:57.639
Siraj Nazir: 30%. Not more than that, because you're talking about elite schools, top of the top schools, the basic requirement, which is more a defensive play. Just to say that don't filter me out because I am an academically like, you know, a disciplined student that's about it.

395
01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:18.929
Siraj Nazir: It does not help you get in. It only helps you be in the race. But the worst thing that we want to, really and we we, I, I and and Jenny, knows this. I know, Arnold. Everyone like brilliant student type of 4 plus, you know Montavista high you Sacco, you Samo! All that kind of Monte Vista, you know. Very, not private school, but very, very competitive. And what what we did

396
01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:37.499
Siraj Nazir: for a head of products at Google, I basically work with a parent for 4 weeks. It took me to basically remove them from that cookie cutter profile because they started looking at it. It's so, cookie Cutter. So what I want to do is like, you know. Don't be in that kind of race to the bottom mindset. I think what you need to see is like, what's your unique thing.

397
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:54.879
Siraj Nazir: you know, and and work on very high impact kind of projects. That will be game changing. You know, the spikes are very important. So I just wanted to set that time. You know that message. And then, hopefully, you know, once we have the draft next week we'll be able to further do, but definitely send us all the questions.

398
01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:57.209
Siraj Nazir: The key message is this.

399
01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:02.489
Siraj Nazir: all the semantic questions, the basic questions are good.

400
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:06.820
Siraj Nazir: but the things that really eventually drives the outcome are

401
01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.500
Siraj Nazir: the, the, the personality. It's it's basically who is out of.

402
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:20.399
Siraj Nazir: you know. Is what what what does he stand for? What does Rf. Stand for? What community impact is he Gonna do at Stanford and for the rest of the world?

403
01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:48.420
Siraj Nazir: Because, remember, these business entities. The top Stanfords of the world are at the end of the day. They thrive on their alumni impact in the world. That's how they succeed. So they really are looking for their next president. You know that ninth President Howard is looking for, and probably, you know, Stanford is looking for the next kind of. So you're really going to be in that kind of an environment. And and and the mindset needs to be that it should not be at a at a level where we're just looking at some small checklist items, we should be thinking, how can I create a bigger impact?

404
01:06:48.980 --> 01:07:11.026
Siraj Nazir: Okay, yeah, thanks a lot so we will. You know, Peel, please feel free to send me some more like pressing questions. You might have always there to help you. We have a lot of expertise on that. But I just wanted to also highlight. Why are we different? And where we'll be focusing on. Really, this, these are the things that we don't typically focus a lot on, because we know the outcome is driven by different things. So.

405
01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:17.579
Ajay: So well, what is the next step Siddijj? After this.

406
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:32.479
Siraj Nazir: So what we do is like every Wednesday we have a team meeting, and you know what we do is whatever we have done today. So Jenny has already taken her initial kind of notes. Of course, we also have AI notes. We have all these things. What we do is.

407
01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:50.759
Siraj Nazir: we review every new student that has been reviewed to and also like existing students. And we have take a collective. You know, input from everyone. Right? You know what can be? Because our goal at the end of the day, while we want to answer your QQA. Our goal is really of not about school, school selection or core selection. What is right? You know. What is the narrative

408
01:07:51.283 --> 01:08:06.040
Siraj Nazir: like, for example, Jenny, like Jenny, will now have a recommendation. I think he's really he has a path to Stanford, or might be, he's actually better position for Mit. He's because it like she's already given a recommendation with some initial signals that he's more a research kind of a profile.

409
01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:10.730
Siraj Nazir: So and again, like because you're in eighth grade, we don't also want to converse too fast.

410
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:36.659
Siraj Nazir: so it will be slightly diverse. But we will identify a few areas where we feel that you should start working on extra curricular activities and things like that. So what we are doing is we are really drafting your kind of 4 years down the road. What is that college that you are actually meant to be in, where you can really thrive and survive. And you know, shine also in few major areas. But also, what are the kind of areas that we want to put you on track and pave that path for you? Is it research?

411
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:55.299
Siraj Nazir: She's like, Oh, he's also into, like, you know, violin and piano, or like, you know, he's into sports. So we are. Gonna carve out that narrative first, and then look at some ideas and come up with some specific ideas. And that's where you know, someone would say, Hey, you know I did this thing when I was in a school like that's where the power of collective we are a collective team.

412
01:08:55.603 --> 01:09:20.460
Siraj Nazir: What we'll do is we'll have the draft ready in the next week after it takes at least like 4, 5 weeks, and you know more comments. So next week we'll have a similar one 1 h checkpoint, and I think Jenny will kind of walk through an initial draft there, get some more feedback and and as I've shown you other reports, we'll be writing more specifics. And meanwhile, during the whole week, you're more than welcome to send. Thanks, you know, like more questions

413
01:09:20.686 --> 01:09:43.780
Siraj Nazir: based on the discussion today or other pressing needs. You know, this is really to help you because you have pressing needs. Right? You have to decide. You have to go to school. I can empathize that as a parent. So what I would recommend is like, you know, feel free to send very pressing needs and urgent issues which are gonna be decide. And that is something that I can get you offline. But but I don't want to also kind of dilute the power of the narrative, and the framework we want to build for is long term success.

414
01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:55.710
Siraj Nazir: because if we start making it to kind of transactional, then the value is gone, and that's my only fear, and we don't try to do that. It kind of, you know, dilutes the value of the framework that we want to build. If that makes sense.

415
01:09:55.710 --> 01:10:00.549
Ajay: Yeah, it makes sense. So, Susan, which is the email I we have to. If you need to ask any questions.

416
01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:07.670
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, it's the same email that you know, you actually booked your support@ibm.com.

417
01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:08.150
Ajay: Okay.

418
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:10.650
Siraj Nazir: Never yeah in in this invite. Right?

419
01:10:10.943 --> 01:10:18.050
Siraj Nazir: So the zoom invite just replied to all, it's fine. Let everyone be in the copy that's fine like Jenny is gonna be Jenny's our head coach.

420
01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:25.500
Siraj Nazir: She's also founding. Pm, she's part of my startup week. It's she's helped us co-create this. So we are a team, you know. We don't work like,

421
01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:32.809
Siraj Nazir: you know, they're all part of the company. They have vested interest in the company. We want students to succeed. So we work as a team.

422
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:59.380
Ajay: Okay. So just one more question you. You said we are some of the cookie cutter, but you wanted to ask a little bit differently did you get to ask all of those? Is there anything at this point missing in the things you wanted to discover discover? For from our perspective was, all the questions we wanted to ask is covered today. You can also email us if you if you want to know more about auto as a person? Did we cover that.

423
01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:15.770
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think we covered. We started to get into it. I think we spend our second session going a little bit deeper. I think today was mostly about getting some of the more pressing things out of the way, saying the framework and starting the why questioning? But I think more of that will happen. That's why we have the 2 sessions.

424
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:24.940
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, one more session. And and, Jenny, please feel free to drop. I know you have school. Jenny's actually doing a semester in China. She's now in Beijing, Beijing.

425
01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:25.594
Ajay: So.

426
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.629
Siraj Nazir: Yeah. So please go. I mean, she. You know, Stanford students go to this like kind of international kind of semester. So

427
01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:34.500
Siraj Nazir: thanks, thanks very much.

428
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.459
Ajay: Thank you. Thanks.

429
01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.029
Jenny Duan: Happy to reach out to you.

430
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:38.400
Siraj Nazir: 5 a minute. Yeah. Good.

431
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.719
Ajay: Thank you. Thank you.

432
01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:58.189
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean again, I didn't mean to say that. You know, we did not cover anything but just What? What you remember like, however, when I start because I I I was the one who also told Jenny that hey, Jenny, these are pressing things for parents. They are making some very hard decisions. So what happened was she kind of flipped the model

433
01:11:58.816 --> 01:12:07.129
Siraj Nazir: even though I early on said, with our past experiences. We had some learnings where I had to repeat the session because I was not personally satisfied. I was not satisfied.

434
01:12:07.509 --> 01:12:19.370
Siraj Nazir: Because I you know, it's very in the spur of the moment. What happens is when you bring up transactional topic in really a deep assessment thing you lose the value of the deep assessment because you get biased

435
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:28.710
Siraj Nazir: right? So now you're and and you know it was easily that I was seeing that we were spending a lot of time, but it's fine then I then I think Jenny herself. She had a plan where she said.

436
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:35.269
Siraj Nazir: let me get his interest through. She was using that as a mechanism because she's also a psychology minor. So she has certain way of doing it.

437
01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:37.240
Siraj Nazir: I think it was interesting

438
01:12:37.618 --> 01:12:52.079
Siraj Nazir: but it was fundamentally important for our of and you all to understand that our goal is not to help that way. I think. Then eventually she said, Okay, Deca, all that is good. But remember, like you know, she herself said that that should not be a focus like because.

439
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.720
Ajay: That's it. Okay.

440
01:12:54.040 --> 01:13:00.110
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, so that's totally fine. I I hope, at least on the pressing items you were able to get some inputs.

441
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.777
Ajay: Yeah, yeah, take it. Yeah, perfect. Thank you.

442
01:13:04.526 --> 01:13:11.259
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think. You know, let let me know if you still need some more data points before you decide.

443
01:13:11.661 --> 01:13:21.940
Siraj Nazir: But I think out of I mean, I'm very, very impressed out of, because I you know my job in these meetings is really to observe parents and student. That is my job

444
01:13:22.486 --> 01:13:33.289
Siraj Nazir: to kind of generally see where the passion is coming. The gap that I tried to really solve is, I have a very candid conversation with parents out afterwards, because I can relate they can relate to me. I tell them

445
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:38.489
Siraj Nazir: certain things that I made a mistake in, and certain things. I see parents making a mistake and outcome has a bigger impact.

446
01:13:39.099 --> 01:13:49.329
Siraj Nazir: But I think without of Number one, I think out of your very mature and smart for your age. You're very, very methodical and articulative, and you're speaking. Those are your skills that will really shine out

447
01:13:49.773 --> 01:13:59.680
Siraj Nazir: so focus on that. Don't get too much stress by all your peer pressure. And see number one. The best thing about college preparation is this, out of the best thing I'll tell you.

448
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.279
Siraj Nazir: Ubu is the only way to succeed period

449
01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:04.740
Siraj Nazir: you being you

450
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:07.440
Siraj Nazir: is the only way to stand out.

451
01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:19.660
Siraj Nazir: It is about it. In this. It is not about fitting in. It is about standing out. So the way you stand out is easy. The easiest way is just, don't do what others are doing in some ways right? I'm not saying not to do good things.

452
01:14:19.967 --> 01:14:22.839
Siraj Nazir: If someone else is becoming a leader of a club.

453
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:48.409
Siraj Nazir: if someone is raising $15,000 on nonprofit every week. We hear some news coming out of right. You don't take it to your heart because your journey your path is very different. And and the thing is this, no one can cut out a path for you. If if if I were to put, if I were to tell you that I know the secret of getting into an Iv. And this is your path. That is a bluff that is actually completely false. The beauty is, it's a it's a discovery journey

454
01:14:48.746 --> 01:14:56.880
Siraj Nazir: but we need to keep the end goal in mind like urgent. You know, we have to keep that in mind. What is the eyes on the price? And we enjoy the journey.

455
01:14:57.512 --> 01:15:13.937
Siraj Nazir: And I'm more than happy to, you know. Have we will. We'll work on it. I I think you have great prospects, and you're very committed and driven. So that is very important. So I'm I'm personally very impressed, and I think Jenny was also very impressed as she. I'm glad she highlighted. Your key strengths so focus on that. And

456
01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.220
Siraj Nazir: thanks a lot for your time again.

457
01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.949
Ajay: And thank you. Thanks it, Ashley. Thanks, bye.

458
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:19.949
Siraj Nazir: I mean enjoy it, bye.

459
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.890
Ajay: Bye, bye, bye, bye.
