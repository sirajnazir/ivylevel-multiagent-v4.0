00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.800
Neelam Rani: Hello, hey, Jenny!

2
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.910
Jenny Duan: Hi Ashtia! Hi! Neilam.

3
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.770
Arshiya Kalra: And then.

4
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.170
Jenny Duan: Jenny.

5
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.980
Neelam Rani: Nice meeting, you.

6
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:29.680
Jenny Duan: Wonderful we'll see for a moment if Sir Raj is joining him. I'm gonna make some opening remarks, but if not we can just get started. I'll start with a brief introduction. If that works. Yeah, I'm Jenny. I've been with Iv level for about a year and a half now, and

7
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:43.592
Jenny Duan: I've been mentoring students for a very long time. I'm a current student at Stanford University, where I'm majoring in symbolic systems, which is an interdisciplinary major that combines Cs psychology and philosophy. And I'm concentrating in human Centered AI

8
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:54.299
Jenny Duan: and I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, and very excited to get to know you. I'd love to just hear a brief introduction from you, and maybe from your parents as well.

9
00:04:55.531 --> 00:05:07.530
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah. Of course, my name's Ursia. I'm a junior at basis, independent Silicon Valley, located in the bay. I'm interested in computer science. And yeah.

10
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.800
Jenny Duan: Awesome. And what grade are you in school right now?

11
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.729
Arshiya Kalra: An 11th grader.

12
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.520
Jenny Duan: Awesome.

13
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:28.519
Jenny Duan: Alright cool. So it's been 2 min. I think Soraj might be joining in a little bit. I don't want to waste our time. So I think, let's just go ahead and get started. So how? Today's session is going to work is

14
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:51.920
Jenny Duan: I'm going to be asking you a series of questions aimed at getting to know you and to learn more about your background and profile. I understand that you're a junior. So most of our focus while working together is probably gonna be on doing things related to your college application because you're a junior. There's not as much time for exploration. But it's more about like narrowing in on your focus and making sure that you're as prepared as possible for next year's admission cycle.

15
00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:16.870
Jenny Duan: We have from now until next September, about one year to really prepare yourself, and not only prepare yourself, but also help you discover what you like, what you're interested in and what you're hoping to do with your life, because ultimately, I think, living in the Bay Area right now, a lot of college application processes are viewed as very much of a rat race, where all you're doing is competing with other people and trying to get

16
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:45.839
Jenny Duan: to a procedure to university. But I think what students lack. There is, 1st of all, an understanding of what they want to do with their future. What is a good path for them what they can do to get there, and also like, why is getting to a good college? In the 1st place, it's not just because everyone else does it? It's because, you know, this is an amazing opportunity to meet new people to grow in a very pivotal time in your life. And so I'll also help you through like that process of like self discovery and figuring out where exactly is the best institution for you.

17
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:54.679
Jenny Duan: so yeah, I'm going to be asking you a series of questions, just so we can prepare your profile, and so I can get to know you a little bit better. Hi, sir, I just saw you joined. Do you have any.

18
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.550
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, to, add.

19
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.529
Jenny Duan: I was just doing some introductions.

20
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:09.010
Siraj Nazir: Amazing thanks. A lot, you know. I mean, like, that's that's the standard of my coaches, you know. They are like so disciplined. You know it's very hard to cap, you know. Catch up. I get nervous. Thanks, Jenny, for joining. Thanks. A lot welcome on board

21
00:07:09.617 --> 00:07:17.550
Siraj Nazir: my sister-in-law's name is actually Arshi. I just spoke to her. You know she lives in Milwaukee, Milwaukee. Now, I said, Hey, you know, Usha, starting today so excited to have you

22
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.121
Siraj Nazir: how the thing is?

23
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:33.340
Siraj Nazir: amazing, you know. So, Jenny, I'll just take some time, I think. You know, because there are certain kind of nuances and differences, I would say, just to set the stage. And you know, it's a long term program so we are not really in a rush.

24
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.309
Siraj Nazir: so you know, I know that you're actually gone to, you know, Zenith. And you know, I basically had my kids started zenith, but they were still like in 8th grade.

25
00:07:43.603 --> 00:08:08.719
Siraj Nazir: You know I'm pretty much, very familiar with the entire pitch and and all the all that stuff so it kind of puts you in a place where you know you kind of are kind of familiar, you know, with with the kind of pitch and presentation and marketing, and all that stuff that happens so would love to 1st understand your your kind of you know things that you expected, because you've gone through a college prep service. I mean, it's not even about Zenith. You've gone through a service.

26
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:22.379
Siraj Nazir: and you had certain goals and aspirations and things that you got help in and things you did not. That will really help us to also understand, you know. If there is any kind of areas that

27
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.729
Siraj Nazir: you know, we need to also address some gaps in terms of like what success looks like.

28
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:41.100
Siraj Nazir: You know, and and really start, you know, with that kind of alignment that's very important. And this is a very, very important session. And I really, we we really prioritize and accelerated it because your junior, you know, year. And and we really wanted to do it.

29
00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:53.659
Siraj Nazir: You know, without a proper amazing, you know, I would say, like a precision game plan. It's very hard, and you will see the value coming out of it. But I would love to kind of hear from you. Arsha!

30
00:08:53.954 --> 00:09:01.640
Siraj Nazir: You know what you went through, and you know, like, what? What is that? That resonated did not work your biggest pain points and challenges.

31
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.229
Siraj Nazir: and then we'll take it from there.

32
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:11.630
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah, yeah, of course. So, going into zenith, I was hoping it would help me find more opportunities, because

33
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:36.089
Arshiya Kalra: living where I am and going to the school that I go to. Everyone does very similar things, and I didn't really know how to be unique, to make my application stand out. So I expected, like some help in finding summer programs or internships or just things that I could apply to or like, even skills that I could learn

34
00:09:36.090 --> 00:10:00.899
Arshiya Kalra: that would help me. Personally, I don't think they did that, especially with summer, because what I did over the summer the internship I discovered that, like our family, discovered it ourselves. I applied for it myself, and they didn't contribute very much. And I feel like I just wasn't what my expectations were. It was not what they were giving.

35
00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:09.109
Arshiya Kalra: So yeah, I just expected more guidance and a little more like help in finding opportunities. Yeah.

36
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:25.490
Siraj Nazir: Okay? And why? You know, standing out was important to you, like, you know, I mean, what? What is your your definition of standing out. And what makes you believe that having those opportunities say, probably in summer, will actually give you the kind of results that you're looking for. Yeah.

37
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:48.521
Arshiya Kalra: Of course. So by standing out, I I don't mean, like every that the things that people are doing are boring because I I participate in them. But, my school is quite small. So whenever I go to these activities and these events, I'm constantly surrounded by the same people. For example, in my research organization, we recently had an exposition where we presented

38
00:10:48.870 --> 00:11:00.470
Arshiya Kalra: on my floor. I saw around 20 kids from my grade alone, not even my school. So I felt like I wasn't really learning, like I wasn't

39
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:17.160
Arshiya Kalra: showing the uniqueness that I bring, because I was just doing the same things that everyone else was doing. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. I just want to explore something a little bit more different, and just have like a chance

40
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.060
Arshiya Kalra: to

41
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.329
Arshiya Kalra: follow a path that would like.

42
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.450
Arshiya Kalra: let me just explore more. Yeah.

43
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:47.390
Siraj Nazir: Okay. So you basically, I think standing up because you know, people have needs to stand out for different reasons. Right? And as as I said, we are very outcome, driven and just to focus on the you know, the one data point that you spoke about and I showed you proof is in the pudding, and Jenny is a founding pm, and you know she's been very instrumental with a few girls, and where we've literally our stats stats today are that

44
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:58.829
Siraj Nazir: you know. I we I did like out of every 10 opportunities that we identify. And this is not about just identifying some random opportunity, and you'll see how it goes about it. You know, Jenny, Jenny does it, or any other coach

45
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:05.000
Siraj Nazir: we we literally like have at least 4 like we hit 4 right? Of course, it takes lot of preparation.

46
00:12:05.253 --> 00:12:21.339
Siraj Nazir: You know. We we all know, you know. People say that, you know, getting into a competitive thing is a lottery. But at the end of the day, like lottery, is opportunity plus execution. Right? You grab it and then eventually win. And we have seen that. So you know, that's something that I can right away head on. That is actually one of

47
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:38.550
Siraj Nazir: the most important reasons that I you know, I've really actually went went in full because I started seeing these results coming out. That outcome every student right, I would say in some way or form. And I think that's where a lot of work needs to happen in being able to.

48
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:57.780
Siraj Nazir: you know, recurringly like identify the right opportunities and not just for the sake of it. Right? So that's number one. So that I want to kind of give you some piece on the second thing. You know. Great point that you know you. You know you want to be unique. You want to follow a separate path, and and you know. Most most of the times, like parents.

49
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:12.040
Siraj Nazir: have that kind of need, because they have heard from all these marketing campaigns and all these different, you know of being an ex crimson and ex Senate myself. That, hey? You know, it's a very competitive thing. You need to stand out right from a college application standpoint. It's very true, by the way.

50
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:20.739
Siraj Nazir: right? But I mean, you gave like, you know, like my understanding was different. Like, you know you you're like, I mean, I want to really do something different. And I want to carve out my path.

51
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:27.620
Siraj Nazir: you know, to get into, probably, and I'm trying to fill it. And I don't want to put words in your mouth. But in some ways

52
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:33.089
Siraj Nazir: you kind of you feel like you're basically doing the same kind of cookie cutter things, you know, like everyone else.

53
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.880
Siraj Nazir: And you just want to find your own unique niche pad.

54
00:13:37.215 --> 00:13:44.830
Siraj Nazir: College being one of the key milestones, I would say, that's why we are talking. But then again, it's beyond that, right? I'm I'm I'm just trying to understand that correctly.

55
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.500
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah, that's that's right. Yeah.

56
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:58.089
Siraj Nazir: Awesome. Okay? I think. Good. Good to know some insights, you know. 2 areas. So yeah, I will hand it over to Jenny, I think today's goal is the 1st session.

57
00:13:58.364 --> 00:14:20.010
Siraj Nazir: Oh, and Jenny is really going to understand. You know. I think all her questions are gonna be geared towards, and she's done like hundreds of this hundreds of times, and hundreds of she's she's a pro, and you'll see that. You know. I don't know how much she introduced herself, but she's interdisciplinary. That's 1 of the you know, exciting things about Stanford that really like attracted me towards the the kind of caliber and coaches

58
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:35.079
Siraj Nazir: is that they're very interdisciplinary, right? She has a minor in psychology. She's doing Cs AI, you know, machine learning and all that stuff so her goal will really be. There's no right or wrong answer like, and and she'll give you the the format and everything else I

59
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:50.679
Siraj Nazir: really want you to, you know. Come out. And this is really about subjectivity. That's the most important thing, right? Like it is not really objectivity, right? Because it's not very hard to find a list of opportunities to be honest, right like you don't need to really be talking to me, and I know I don't need to be like running a service.

60
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.150
Siraj Nazir: There's tons of resources out there.

61
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.280
Siraj Nazir: I think. What is the most important missing element at the end of the day that will help you stand out is your share, basically.

62
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:12.630
Siraj Nazir: And I think that is the fund. And that is why the weekly execution and hand holding, and, you know, like the engagement, the magic happens when in pretty much everything that Jenny does as an example or any other coach does with the student.

63
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:22.060
Siraj Nazir: Every single time they weave in their personality their subjectivity. They ask questions. So it's like, it's not like, okay, you know. Give me 5 ideas about passion project

64
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.740
Siraj Nazir: objectively.

65
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:51.080
Siraj Nazir: You can go and figure it out. You can ask, chat, gpt. Today, for example, it might come up with some great ideas. But the thing that Chat Gp doesn't understand about you is what we are trying to like. Your personal contact, your subjectivity, and all that right? So feel free to like, give out as much information as possible, and then, as a next step, we'll have the game plan, you know, carved out. And again, it's a living document, you know. Your parents would know, like, you know, roadmaps are all living documents we want to have like, but we at least need some clarity in terms of

66
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:58.280
Siraj Nazir: some high precision things we want to target and also optimize for the remaining time we have. That's also very important.

67
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:14.440
Siraj Nazir: because we do have, like, you know, from basic school. So, Jenny, she's from basic school, you know from, you know, we do have other students as well. You know the 8 9 grade. When you have more time you can do Sacco and all that stuff right. But now we have to see for the biggest return of investment, you know. Bang for the buck. Right? So that will be the goal.

68
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.070
Siraj Nazir: And then we will take it.

69
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:26.829
Siraj Nazir: Sorry. I mean, I I had to really set the stage because of the kind of you know. Prep preparation that you have already done, and you are coming from another like, you know, a competitive school a small school. So I wanted to get the expectations right.

70
00:16:27.272 --> 00:16:32.409
Siraj Nazir: Thank you. So, Jenny, over to you, and you know, let's just see the the magic happen.

71
00:16:32.720 --> 00:17:00.020
Jenny Duan: Wonderful. Well, it's really nice to meet you again, and thanks Siraj for the introduction, so I think let's just get started. I'm pretty familiar with the basis school system. I have a lot of friends who went to bisp, but also like some of the basis schools across the country. So I 1st just wanna check in and see like, how is basis going for you and how do you like the environment there? And like, I've heard it's super competitive. But I'm wondering, like, what is your personal experience at basis has been so far.

72
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:29.879
Arshiya Kalra: I I've been going there since 5th grade. So I I know most of the people there. So it's a very small school, so you know, everyone, there's around a hundred kids in my grade, and I think that kind of fosters the competitiveness because, you've kind of seen like people be good at certain subjects and not and like you've just seen them like kind of grow. And now they're like your direct competition, and there is like there. It's a lot of passive, aggressive competitiveness.

73
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.129
Arshiya Kalra: They won't say outright to your face, but they'll ask you for your grades like

74
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:46.000
Arshiya Kalra: on tests and stuff, and like, you can see by their reaction, like, whether you did better than them or you did worse. And it's just yeah. They're

75
00:17:47.034 --> 00:17:49.360
Arshiya Kalra: they're all very

76
00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:57.550
Arshiya Kalra: passive, aggressive, and especially in Junior year. Now, that they're the competitiveness and the sort of like

77
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.860
Arshiya Kalra: rivalry is starting to show a lot more. For example,

78
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:23.979
Arshiya Kalra: one of my friends asked to ta for a class, and the teacher accidentally emailed someone else back with their response. And that classmate didn't tell my friends that the teacher accidentally emailed them. So just small things like that, they just kind of build up. So it leads to a bit of animosity. Yeah.

79
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:53.759
Jenny Duan: I see. Yeah, that sounds really frustrating. Is this something that you enjoy, or something that you don't enjoy? Because in the context of college applications. Like this is kind of more on the meta level. But I'm trying to see like, okay, if this is a good environment for you, if it's a bad environment for you, how does that later on in the future inform, like, what type of schools you apply to? Because some schools are, gonna be more competitive. Some are going to be more collaborative. But, like different students have different fits. So do you think you enjoy this environment? Or do you. Do you think it's toxic and like, want to leave.

80
00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:59.500
Arshiya Kalra: I think I work well under high pressure environments. Maybe not

81
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:08.489
Arshiya Kalra: an environment quite so toxic. But I do like like the competitiveness and the sort of like pressure, like at least limits, though. Yeah.

82
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:16.860
Jenny Duan: Makes a lot of sense alright. And with that I'm curious like, can you tell me a bit about your course load this year, and what you've taken in your sophomore and freshman year.

83
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:31.659
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah, of course. So I wanted my junior year to be a bit lighter on the courses. So I'm taking honors, chemistry ap physics, one ap world ap stats, French, 4

84
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.480
Arshiya Kalra: of

85
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.190
Arshiya Kalra: ap computer science principles.

86
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.809
Arshiya Kalra: the one more class

87
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:59.710
Arshiya Kalra: ap English language and composition. So 5 aps this year one honors and one normal class, and last year I took 6 aps, one honors and one normal class and freshman year, 3 honors, 3 Aps and one normal class.

88
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.419
Jenny Duan: Alright awesome! And then

89
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.209
Jenny Duan: what are your what is your Gpa.

90
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.950
Jenny Duan: We.

91
00:20:06.281 --> 00:20:24.830
Arshiya Kalra: I have a 4.7 weighted, and I have a 3.9 1 unweighted. But my school does a minuses. So 90 to 93 is a 3.6 7. So that's why I have a 3.9 1. But I don't have a single B or anything like that. Yeah.

92
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:32.310
Jenny Duan: Not. In which classes did you get the a minuses? My high school also did a minuses. So I totally understand, like how that system can be frustrating.

93
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.400
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah, sorry. Let me just pull up my transcript real quick. I have.

94
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.350
Jenny Duan: No problem.

95
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.360
Arshiya Kalra: Hmm.

96
00:20:40.185 --> 00:20:44.210
Arshiya Kalra: so I got an a minus in

97
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:53.068
Arshiya Kalra: French 3. My sophomore year, French 2. My freshman year

98
00:20:53.890 --> 00:21:02.650
Arshiya Kalra: honors, English language and composition and digital art. I honestly have no clue how I got an a minus on the last one. But yeah.

99
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:25.800
Jenny Duan: Oh, that's fine. All of those classes aren't like your main stem courses, which is what you're applying to. So that should honestly be okay, would you? How would you say you does basis rank? By the way, I don't know. No, yeah, that's good. How would you say you compare like compared to your peers. Do you say you're like one of the top 5 students top like 5%, 10%? If you could rank yourself, what would you say.

100
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.379
Arshiya Kalra: I would say that I'm above average because

101
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.330
Arshiya Kalra: I

102
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:43.269
Arshiya Kalra: yeah, because of the course load I would say that I have to study a lot less than some of my peers in order to get the same grades.

103
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.034
Arshiya Kalra: But

104
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:53.359
Arshiya Kalra: yeah, like, in terms of like general smartness. And like, how people like answer questions. I'd say I'm above average, like in class

105
00:21:53.691 --> 00:21:59.119
Arshiya Kalra: but in terms of grades, I think I'm pretty on par with the top 15% top 10% yeah.

106
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.256
Jenny Duan: Okay, thanks.

107
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:09.059
Jenny Duan: And then how is your relationship with your teachers? Would you say.

108
00:22:09.952 --> 00:22:29.567
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah, I I think I have a pretty good relationship with most of my teachers, especially the my computer science teacher. I had her my freshman year, and then I peer tutored for her my sophomore year. And this year I'm taking her class again for computer science principles, and I'm continuing to peer tutor with her.

109
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:45.490
Arshiya Kalra: And I think I tend to have a better relationship like, aside from that with my English and my history teachers, because, those are classes in which, like you can express opinions. And I'm also just interested in history.

110
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:53.589
Jenny Duan: Awesome. Will you say you speak more in class, or are you more quiet and like in school? Are you more social, or are you more introverted.

111
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:57.798
Arshiya Kalra: I I definitely tend to speak in class

112
00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.030
Arshiya Kalra: if I if I like it. Which

113
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:08.480
Arshiya Kalra: yeah, so I'll answer questions and I'll ask questions. But I'm also pretty outgoing at school.

114
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:37.589
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's awesome. These are all really, really good and keep it up. And again, like the reason why I'm asking you this is because college admissions is so holistic, and I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that it's only about your grades, or only about your test scores. But, as you know, there are a lot of really small factors that can make or break or make the difference in someone's admissions, which is like your relationships with teachers. I think people really undervalue like the weight that a good letter of recommendation can have. So it's really good that you've already built those relationships. And like, continue.

115
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:50.320
Jenny Duan: do so by speaking up in class and making a good impression with your peers, because the way that you're viewed by your peers and your teachers like it really matters in the long term, not only for colleges, but also like summer program applications which will talk about awards and

116
00:23:50.599 --> 00:24:11.310
Jenny Duan: things like that, too. So that's really awesome. Now, I think the next thing that I'd love to learn more about is what are some of your extracurricular involvements or commitments outside of school. I know that one concern you have is like having a cookie cutter profile, and that's something that we'll definitely build upon. But I'd love to learn like what is the foundation and what we're working with right now.

117
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:16.259
Arshiya Kalra: Of course. So one of my main focuses in my extracurriculars is dance.

118
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:30.919
Arshiya Kalra: I've been dancing since I was 5, and at the same place where I dance. I now teach younger kids dance, and I do Bollywood dance. So yeah, I'm also the captain and social media manager of my school's Bollywood dance team.

119
00:24:31.580 --> 00:25:00.920
Arshiya Kalra: And yeah, so that's a dance. And then outside of that, I research at Asdrp, which is the aspiring scholars directed research program. I'm doing research, using AI in healthcare. That was the program the expo that I presented at where a lot of my classmates also research. So yeah, I've been doing science Olympiad since 8th grade. And

120
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:08.333
Arshiya Kalra: I got a subject, captain or officer position this year for

121
00:25:09.702 --> 00:25:27.940
Arshiya Kalra: I think it was engineering and technology, and I rank top 15 or top 20 in regionals for my for anatomy and physiology, and I'm pretty sure one of my other events as well, I

122
00:25:28.711 --> 00:25:37.579
Arshiya Kalra: this summer completed an internship at Axon. It does body cameras and tasers for

123
00:25:38.113 --> 00:25:42.746
Arshiya Kalra: police. Yeah. So I did that for around 2 months.

124
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:49.660
Arshiya Kalra: I was a software engineering intern outside of that, I'm a Girl Scout since

125
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:57.329
Arshiya Kalra: 5 years, and I I'm working on my prerequisite to start my gold award.

126
00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:08.199
Arshiya Kalra: So yeah. And I, just recently this year became one of the leaders for Middle School Science Bowl. So I run the Middle School Club

127
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.049
Arshiya Kalra: with a couple other people. But

128
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.639
Arshiya Kalra: yeah, I think I think that's it.

129
00:26:18.846 --> 00:26:21.526
Jenny Duan: Awesome. So right now I have

130
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:49.309
Jenny Duan: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 6 key extracurriculars that you're involved in. And let me just repeat them to you. So this seems right. No. 7. So Bollywood dance teaching the younger kids dance. That's 1 you're the captain and social media manager of your school dance team. That's the second one research at Asdrp Science Olympiad. You're the subject officer internship at Axon the summer you're a Girl Scout, and you're a leader for the Middle School Science Bowl. Is that all correct?

131
00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.240
Arshiya Kalra: Yes.

132
00:26:50.740 --> 00:27:08.080
Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. That's a really good balance of different activities. And I think this is a really good foundation so far. So I'm really happy to hear that. So I know that one of your concerns was feeling like you had a cookie cutter profile. Can you tell me a bit about that

133
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.970
Jenny Duan: up.

134
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:29.920
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah, of course. So everyone at my school tends to take anywhere from like 10 to like 18, like 1516, 17 Aps. So I took. I'm I'm planning on taking 14 as to stay in like the average. But again, that's not like unique to my school.

135
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:59.574
Arshiya Kalra: I want to dual enroll, but I know again other people from my school will be doing that as well. But like those are common, for, like everyone, so that's not my main concern, but like outside of school, asdrp, particularly. I know mo like 1 3rd of my grade, does it? And a lot of them. It's a hundred person grade. And I know a lot of them also want to go into computer science. So I don't think that research shows like anything special about me, because

136
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:20.412
Arshiya Kalra: even when I was applying to Asdrp, I asked, like someone in the grade above me, who does it, hey? How'd the application. Go, they said. The application doesn't really matter, because they take you if you come from basis, anyways. So I think that just kind of like diminished like my expectations, or like my

137
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.490
Arshiya Kalra: sense of like accomplishment towards that.

138
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.609
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah. Sorry.

139
00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.710
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Totally.

140
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:45.889
Siraj Nazir: I, yeah, I I just wanted to raise hand. I could not like, you know, control myself. You know, we know this, like, you know. It's it's it's very you know. I I know we're kind of smiling here. Jenny knows this. Unfortunately, there are these kind of I mean. I don't. I don't want to call it out like a scam or anything else. But unfortunately

141
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:53.709
Siraj Nazir: there are many, many shops of this sort, some AI programs. And I mean you're not the 1st one. It's something. It's a recurring theme.

142
00:28:53.960 --> 00:29:16.780
Siraj Nazir: You know, it probably can only be more prohibitive not to scare you. Unfortunately, you know, like Kavier joined recently, I remember, Jenny, like, you know, it's something that we give. It's it's in Fremont, right? The same place. Exactly right? So I mean, you know, I and and that's the sad thing I would love one day to kind of investigate and know you know what's the value chain. How does this mafia work? You know. Sorry for strong language here, but it's a pity that you know, like

143
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.769
Siraj Nazir: people fall into the trap.

144
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:28.869
Siraj Nazir: and it's very easy to kind of make something competitive, and it is not really right. You know, free programs are competitive, and you know Jenny will speak about it. Sorry about that. I just had to interject myself.

145
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:33.130
Neelam Rani: It's not pre-program, Siraj. They charge almost $1,000.

146
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:48.169
Siraj Nazir: I, yeah, I I meant, like, free programs are, you know, prestigious programs. Right? One of the factors, the way we think about really programs are is to get into free programs. Of course, it happens at every level. You know, Iv schools are no like, you know, saints.

147
00:29:48.472 --> 00:30:06.859
Siraj Nazir: They, they operate at a at a bigger level, you know, with summer sessions and all that stuff. But the reality is unfortunately. And I think Jenny will walk through it. But I just I could not. You know it's it's it's it's a pity, you know, unfortunately, that we had a similar thing with AI scholars. Yeah, look not not AI scholars. You know this. That's Cmu thing.

148
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.110
Neelam Rani: We had same experience with Brown.

149
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.690
Siraj Nazir: AI! Sorry.

150
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:19.499
Neelam Rani: With Brown University. Also they we enrolled her, and some odd person was teaching not even a brown professor anymore, like we felt so cheated.

151
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:40.750
Siraj Nazir: You know. Actually, that's the pain that you know Jenny has heard this multiple times. And why I'm into into this right? I've I've I've when I said I spent like $30,000 across 4 years for my older daughter. That's what it is. It was, you know. I'm busy, right? And what do I like? Okay, what, dad? I'm getting nothing, you know, this summer. Okay, go to a Stanford summer session

152
00:30:40.890 --> 00:31:00.289
Siraj Nazir: right? And now I know that they charge $15,000 for international students, and you know, just for a trip, and they charge 5,000. 10,000. I was about to repeat the same thing due to parental guilt for my younger daughter. Like, you know, Jenny, you might be surprised. I don't know if you know this, but with Huda right? And who's Jenny's? Literally transformed her, like Alishka and others. But

153
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.469
Siraj Nazir: I was about to do the same thing when she came to sophomore year.

154
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:24.540
Siraj Nazir: Why? Because then my daughter would feel, oh, you sent my older sister to Stanford, and then and they make it appear like a competitive application. Unfortunately, right? So so I think it's sad and and yes, I felt that she cheated, and you know again. Sorry to go in tangent here, but I could not, you know, help but chime in

155
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:42.599
Siraj Nazir: that. That's something that when you said I'm like, Oh, my God! Not again in spirit. AI! Let's just too many like anyone we would have from all the competitive public schools or private schools from Bay Area. Everyone would put the same standout thing in spirit. AI, that that was the phenomena that was happening last year. I'm like, oh.

156
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:52.429
Siraj Nazir: what what have you d1? 0, I've gone through this upskilling program. Unfortunately, you know parents are the victims. Students are the victims here. Don't worry. I think I think you're in safe hands. We'll change it. Yeah, go ahead.

157
00:31:52.430 --> 00:32:14.739
Jenny Duan: So okay, let's just get to get to like some initial thoughts that I have on your current profile. I think you're really strong. You have a good mix of different things, I think when you're saying you want to stand out so a couple of things with standing out usually what people do to stand out is they have a lot of they have a couple of different spikes. Are you familiar with the concept of like a spike.

158
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:40.989
Jenny Duan: Do you know what I mean when I say that? Yeah. And that doesn't necessarily have to be an academic spike. That also has to do with service and things you do outside of school. So what I'm picking up on is you have really interesting background in like computer science, obviously. And you demonstrate your aptitude through that for science, through science, Olympiad, the research and internship at Axon. I think you also have an interesting like bubble of healthcare related things that we can talk about if that's interesting to you.

159
00:32:41.434 --> 00:32:47.655
Jenny Duan: There's also a lot of leadership, and especially like female empowerment, and like female

160
00:32:48.170 --> 00:33:00.490
Jenny Duan: mentorship with Girl Scouts Leader for Middle School Science Bull and the captain and social media manager of your Bollywood dance team and teaching younger kids dancing. So with that a couple of things that I think

161
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:24.610
Jenny Duan: I, from what I can tell you, seem like you're very outgoing. You seem like a really good leader. And so I really want to take advantage of that. And usually how we structure people's profiles is that they have, like their main interest, and then they have, like a secondary interest. And I'll just speak very briefly about, like the 2 students that I've been working on for with for a long time. So they're both. Also computer science majors. But I'm going to tell you they're aspiring computer science majors. They want to be software engineers.

162
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:33.240
Jenny Duan: But their profiles look so different from one another. They're both also Indian girls living in the Bay area. But let me tell you about their profiles.

163
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:57.610
Jenny Duan: One of them is who does, daughter, and she's amazing. She's got this amazing passion for journalism which we really work to bring out. And this summer we sent her to J. Camp, which is a free journalism program. They only accept 30 students per year. And it's in Austin, Texas. And this has nothing to do with computer science, which is what she's applying for as her major. But it helps showcase another side of her where she could talk about like

164
00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:22.202
Jenny Duan: justice and reporting, and how that relates to like AI ethics, which is another thing that she's passionate about. And so yeah, this program has between like a 5% to 20% acceptance rate. It's completely free. It's in Austin, Texas. This is one student in her profile. And how we built that cause. She's interested in like student news. And that's what she does outside of Cs. Another student, Anushka, is the other student I've been working with. She's really passionate about like food, science and food justice and

165
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:47.780
Jenny Duan: also climates and climate studies. So this summer we got her into this program at Dartmouth. It's completely free, also another highly competitive program. But it's about like the Arctic. And you know, from the outside, it might seem like, Okay, she's a computer science student. Why is she applying for this program to learn about polar research. But like the thing is in her research and her project, you can use technology and AI to understand, like the way that icebergs melt, and the way that, like

166
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:57.409
Jenny Duan: snow formations form. And so computer science is kind of a tool that can be applied very broadly across people with all different interests. And so because you have this spike in leadership.

167
00:34:57.736 --> 00:35:12.123
Jenny Duan: Let's put you in programs that other people don't apply to that. Take advantage of this because there are a lot of programs that are actually free, competitive and stand out. So here's 1 example. That I'm just gonna put it's called

168
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:37.060
Jenny Duan: Camp Rising Sun. The applications for next summer are going to open in November. So this is something that we'll be on the lookout for. This is a fully funded program from the Lucas August, Jonas Foundation. It's in upstate New York, and it's a 2 week long summer program completely free. They'll fly you out for people to go there and develop leadership and ethical leadership skills. I think this is a really good fit for you, because it seems like.

169
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:46.820
Jenny Duan: you're interested in ethics to some extent. Seems like you are care about mentorship and empowerment. And this is also a global program. So full scholarship program. It's

170
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:48.229
Jenny Duan: and there's

171
00:35:48.420 --> 00:36:01.350
Jenny Duan: it's it's 4 weeks long. Sorry. And there's people from all over the world coming together for this fully funded program. So this is something that I would recommend you apply for. This is another program that I think you would be a good fit for. It's called Distinguish young women. Have you heard about this.

172
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.489
Arshiya Kalra: No, I don't think I have.

173
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:17.889
Jenny Duan: Okay. So if you click on this link, it's distinguished. Young woman is a program. It's a scholarship program. That is kind of like a pageant, but it's not quite a pageant. If you look at the if you look at the application, it's

174
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:41.749
Jenny Duan: they're graded on different things, including scholastics, interview, talent, fitness, and self expression. So it's not like a looks pageant. It's about like how you present yourself, and how you can represent your state or your country, as like a young woman based on these categories. And I think you'd be a really good fit, because you're obviously very smart. You're well spoken. Your talent could be like you could do something related to coding. You could do something related to dancing

175
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:52.904
Jenny Duan: fitness. That component is covered by your dance, and then, like self expression, is how you present yourself and how you speak to a panel of judges. If you look at this program, it's been here for a really long time like

176
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.555
Jenny Duan: Previous winners are like

177
00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:05.293
Jenny Duan: Let's see what their I don't know what their alumni are doing. But if you look at their alumni, you can see that like they have.

178
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:12.700
Jenny Duan: they have some like pretty cool people related to this organization. It's been here for a really long time. And like.

179
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:41.790
Jenny Duan: it's a pretty impactful like scholarship program. So I would highly recommend applying for this program as well. It's a it's the largest scholarship program for high school girls for college, and so I think, taking advantage of these types of programs that you know aren't Cs related, but showcase. A different side of you are what we really want to bring out. So instead of doing all like the I don't know mock trial model UN, I think you already have that covered with demonstrating your academic potential. Now it's time to bring out some of your extracurricular things.

180
00:37:41.790 --> 00:38:04.820
Jenny Duan: So that's just right off the bat 2 ideas that I have specifically for you, and of course, like my recommendations, look different for every person. But I'd love to learn more now about like what you care about, because I think another key component of the application is, of course, like demonstrated impact and service. And so I'd love to know, like, are there any issue areas that we maybe haven't talked about that you are really interested in, or that you care a lot about.

181
00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:31.936
Arshiya Kalra: Something I I do really care about is women representation of bipoc women, and just like women in stem in general, because growing up in the bay, I never really felt like the women in stem, like struggle, like I never was able to see it, because my mom also works in computer science, and therefore so do a lot of her female friends from office.

182
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:40.759
Arshiya Kalra: So I I never really like fully understood, like what people were talking about until my internship this summer.

183
00:38:41.092 --> 00:39:05.010
Arshiya Kalra: Because when I went there I like I was ignored for the 1st time, and like I could see that it was cause I was a girl, and it was honestly a very shocking experience for me, and it really put things into perspective on like the real world, and how it actually is hard like for women in stem out there. And I think that's a topic I care about.

184
00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.680
Arshiya Kalra: and also other than that. I

185
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:20.317
Arshiya Kalra: care about women's representation in healthcare because I've I really enjoy like reading the studies done on how like women have not been

186
00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:29.130
Arshiya Kalra: pushed forward in the healthcare space. How, for example, none of the car crash test dummies are women, and how

187
00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:36.720
Arshiya Kalra: stuff like that, just like small mundane stuff doesn't really involve or take into account like

188
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.199
Arshiya Kalra: girls who make up 50% of the world's population.

189
00:39:43.070 --> 00:40:10.750
Jenny Duan: Definitely. And I think that also speaks to like representation and technology as well, because, like, for example, seat belts are an example of emerging technology that didn't account for women. And maybe in the context of computer science, you could speak about how like for example, you know that Amazon's old hiring algorithms used to discriminate against women in the resume screeners. And like, this is, you know, I'm so I think, fixed that. But like in AI algorithms in general. Often women are left out of the equation.

190
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:36.347
Jenny Duan: And I could see this across, like all of the new technology developments. And so that's definitely something that you can take advantage of. Another thing is, I'm not sure how curious you are or interested in about this, but like there's a lot of like intersection between like policing bias and also like technology and the use of body cams. And I think that's can be really interesting. For example, if you look at this organization called future policing.

191
00:40:36.964 --> 00:40:43.965
Jenny Duan: I looked, I just did a quick look at their members list. And they have a lot of people involved in California.

192
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:52.380
Jenny Duan: so if you're interested in that, you can maybe contact some of their California people and see if you could get involved with this organization, or even

193
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:58.169
Jenny Duan: like the California police chiefs, they have an AI

194
00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:14.820
Jenny Duan: resource hub that maybe you could get involved in by like publishing publishing like a article, or contributing to this in some way, or like writing policy. For this I think that would be really interesting to you. Obviously, these are not things that you have to do 100%. I'm just like kind of

195
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:39.749
Jenny Duan: starting to talk about this. So that like later, when we work on developing some of your projects, we can. We can narrow down the focus and figure out what is most interesting to you. But like these are just some straight off the bat, like random ideas that I had in terms of in terms of like healthcare. I noticed that this is something that you care a lot about. I'm actually curious. If you could tell me why you're interested in pursuing computer science and why you think this is the best fit for you.

196
00:41:40.779 --> 00:41:52.630
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah, earlier in my life I did want to go into healthcare, but it was in high school when I made the switch after taking my 1st computer science, like official computer science course.

197
00:41:53.337 --> 00:42:03.640
Arshiya Kalra: I really actually enjoyed coding. And how you can use it for like of like it's very multifaceted, and I can use it for more than one purpose.

198
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:28.580
Arshiya Kalra: And that kind of contrasted to Med, and how I wouldn't exactly be focused into one thing. It's a very diverse field. But I felt like, if I wanted to do something regarding health care or medical in the future, I could use computer science to do that. And I felt it was just a more diverse field which would allow me to approach like more

199
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:32.040
Arshiya Kalra: topics and like, just learn more in general.

200
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:45.189
Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely, and so why computer science versus, like other fields that allow you to solve problems or like, come up with new ideas, like engineering, for example.

201
00:42:45.868 --> 00:43:08.991
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah. So I I've honestly been fascinated with technology. I think it's really cool, like, it sounds kind of basic. But it's like in in my lifetime. I have seen, like constant, like improvements and innovation in the technological field, specifically and especially with the rise of AI recently, like

202
00:43:09.789 --> 00:43:37.849
Arshiya Kalra: deepfakes and synthetic media manipulation, and like like the intersectional field of like AI and cyber security also pulled me towards it, because I feel like it's like it's the future. And if like and I was just really intrigued by all like the innovations and like what you can do with it like. In contrast to like, let's say business, for example, because there's like multiple fields, there's entrepreneurship. There's like marketing all the little deca categories.

203
00:43:38.095 --> 00:43:39.569
Arshiya Kalra: I just felt like there was

204
00:43:39.871 --> 00:43:41.980
Arshiya Kalra: a lot more that I could like

205
00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:44.689
Arshiya Kalra: tangibly do with computer science.

206
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.300
Arshiya Kalra: like, in terms of like.

207
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.790
Arshiya Kalra: what's like coming in the future.

208
00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:53.449
Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely, that's really interesting.

209
00:43:53.738 --> 00:44:06.860
Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm glad that you're able to provide an explanation, because I think a lot of the times when a lot of people want to study computer science, I mean, we all know that computer scientists generally have stable lives. They make good income. But like a lot of people just want to do that

210
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:27.504
Jenny Duan: like, because they know it's a good career. But it's hard to explain their passion. And like, while I think that you should do a career that makes you financially responsible. When you're applying to colleges and things they will ask you like, Why do you want to do this. And even if the reason is, you want to make money like, you can't say that on a college application, right? So it's good that you actually have a reason to back it up.

211
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:40.799
Jenny Duan: and yeah, that seems really awesome. I'm totally here for it. I think we need more women in Cs more women in cyber security, and like, that's an awesome path to be pursuing. Have you heard of this award called aspirations in computing.

212
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:44.689
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah, it's bookmarked to apply when that.

213
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:53.279
Jenny Duan: Okay, I was, gonna say, the applications coming up. So we definitely make a note to like, submit an application for this. I think you have a really good story for this.

214
00:44:53.639 --> 00:45:12.810
Jenny Duan: Another thing is, if you're interested in. I know you mentioned policy a couple of times. I don't know how interested you are in policy, but I think that if you're interested in like history, language, arts like it could be good to like round out your profile a little bit by like learning a little bit more about policy. California.

215
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.369
Jenny Duan: is actually like one of the 1st

216
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.146
Jenny Duan: 1st States to to pass

217
00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:38.184
Jenny Duan: deep fake regulation, which is really interesting. So if you are, this is a just an article that talks more about it. So if you are interested in policy. There is an opportunity to. Perhaps, if you're interested in policing still like work with the police department or work with California Government to

218
00:45:38.520 --> 00:46:02.539
Jenny Duan: to work on some policy or provide insight like a technical perspective on policy measures to combat deepfakes. This also relates to like the women's activism aspect, because a lot of deepfakes do disproportionately affect women, especially with like sexually explicit content. And like pornography, it's like, really dangerous for women in particular, and so like, that's something that you could work on to either.

219
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:18.869
Jenny Duan: Maybe from a research perspective. If you are interested in pursuing research, I'm sure we could connect you to a lab that does research on deepfakes. Or if you want to handle it from the more policy regulation side, we could perhaps either connect you to people in the police bureau or the government depending on what you specifically want to work on.

220
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:31.510
Jenny Duan: So that's really cool. I'm actually curious about like your awards profile. Right now I realize that I forgot to ask you about this earlier. Do you have experience applying for awards? And is this, yeah. Do you have any awards that you want to talk about?

221
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:41.739
Arshiya Kalra: No, I don't really have any awards other than my Girl Scout Silver Award, but that was 8th grade. So I don't think that qualifies this week I'm

222
00:46:41.740 --> 00:47:09.139
Arshiya Kalra: going to Walden West to volunteer to chaperone for my 5th grade field trip. So that gets me a hundred volunteer hours, and since I'm still 15 I am eligible for the Presidential or the Pvsa gold with that. So I was planning on applying for that after this week was over, just to get something and also my psat is coming up in October, so I was hoping to perform well there to at least get like a semi finalist in national merit.

223
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:17.020
Jenny Duan: Awesome. So yeah, Pisa, it's really important. I would study a lot for the Pisa if you can. Because

224
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:45.219
Jenny Duan: a thing about the Psat scores is not just for national merit, but, like Psat, can also qualify you for again, I don't know how interested you are in these things, but like our side that summer program. Ssp, like, I think they all take psat scores. So that's another reason. An incentive to try to perform. Well, if possible? So okay, it seems like awards is something that we really want to focus on. Do you compete in dance? Competitively like, for example, are there competitions. You can do for that.

225
00:47:45.591 --> 00:48:03.799
Arshiya Kalra: My, where I dance doesn't do that. But we're looking into doing like inter high school, like showcases and competitions. But I don't know if we're going to be able to do that. We used to compete pre covid, but after that auxiliary kind of shut us down.

226
00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:05.863
Jenny Duan: Okay. Well,

227
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:16.220
Neelam Rani: Also, we are not aware of any Bollywood dance competitions around, like, even if we want to participate outside of her like current organization. So.

228
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:32.109
Jenny Duan: No problem. This is actually perfect, that we're on this meeting, because this is exactly the type of thing that I'm here to help you with like specific competitions and awards for you. So actually have one. Right here. I want you to take a look at this. This is called young arts. Are you familiar with the young Arts program? Have you heard of this.

229
00:48:33.148 --> 00:48:35.360
Arshiya Kalra: No, I don't think I have.

230
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.096
Jenny Duan: And let me give you the young arts website.

231
00:48:38.550 --> 00:49:05.319
Jenny Duan: the young Arts is an is a national competition. It's really competitive. It's really competitive, which is like both a good and a bad thing. But it's a it's a national competition that searches the best, like artists across the country, and art is a variety of things. It's like film music. It's dance and in the young arts dance competition. The link I just sent you. That the world dance. They actually have a category specifically highlighting Indian dance.

232
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:14.209
Jenny Duan: So you can submit with one dance form. So you can read the descriptions there, for, like the different ones, you can submit. And we also

233
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.850
Jenny Duan: addition. Go ahead. Sorry.

234
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.790
Arshiya Kalra: I think these are only classical dance.

235
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.639
Arshiya Kalra: Do you do.

236
00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.270
Jenny Duan: Cookies, or do you only.

237
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:24.300
Arshiya Kalra: I quit in 5th grade. No, yeah.

238
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:34.806
Jenny Duan: Okay, no problem. Well, if you wanted to perform an audition like, just create a video, a routine, you could do this if if you don't want to. That's also totally fine.

239
00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.640
Jenny Duan: I think these are. I think Bollywood might be fine for this. To be honest.

240
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.480
Arshiya Kalra: And then I.

241
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:57.000
Jenny Duan: You might want to. Like, send them an email asking them. These are just, for example, these are some of the dance forms. It doesn't say that Bollywood isn't a dance form, so like you could clarify with them and see. I don't see why that wouldn't be allowed. But, like

242
00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:01.761
Jenny Duan: you could. This is something you could clarify with it. I'm not actually sure.

243
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.040
Jenny Duan: you know how how that works. But

244
00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.940
Jenny Duan: let me see if they have?

245
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:23.590
Jenny Duan: yeah, I mean, they definitely acknowledge classical dancers. You could email them. I would email them and see if they take Bollywood dance too. But if if so like. This is a good opportunity for you to do that. And they did the deadline, for this is

246
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:27.319
Jenny Duan: October 17th to submit your

247
00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:30.133
Jenny Duan: audition video or your tape?

248
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.665
Jenny Duan: so you have about a month to prepare. If you want to do that

249
00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:46.929
Jenny Duan: and if you win young arts, you have an opportunity to be like a national a presidential scholar of the arts, which is another really prestigious award.

250
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.320
Jenny Duan: so yeah.

251
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:51.314
Jenny Duan: let's see.

252
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.160
Jenny Duan: I'm just doing a quick

253
00:50:55.861 --> 00:50:58.529
Jenny Duan: search to see if there's any other.

254
00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.920
Jenny Duan: Any other dance competitions that might be.

255
00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:09.290
Siraj Nazir: Some of our students are actually so Kaviya is I think she's applying, for she does both Natim and Bhagara.

256
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:20.539
Siraj Nazir: I think Bhaga, if Bangra can go in, I would imagine that Bollywood is pretty much Bhagara. So I you know it's like, and Jenny actually specializes. I mean, she knows more about Bhargnati than I would know. Actually.

257
00:51:21.142 --> 00:51:27.140
Siraj Nazir: yeah, I think we'll figure it out. I mean not to worry. I think the idea is like, you know, they're just like too many opportunities. And

258
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.549
Siraj Nazir: I think also for Bollywood might be we can try and figure out

259
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.989
Siraj Nazir: so we can. We can also take it offline, you know, Jenny.

260
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:36.150
Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, yeah.

261
00:51:36.826 --> 00:51:40.793
Jenny Duan: so I mean, this is just like to get started.

262
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:42.340
Jenny Duan: I think

263
00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:46.824
Jenny Duan: this is not something that we need to figure out too much right now.

264
00:51:47.530 --> 00:52:06.929
Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna send you one really quick thing right now to I have to. All these. I need to kind of look more into. These are just initial initial ideas. But this is another thing located in millipedes, California, and it's a national like competition. I think it might be

265
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:30.320
Jenny Duan: team based, too. So if you wanted to take your like school team and prepare for that, that could be good too. This is specifically Bollywood dance. But I don't. I? Again, I haven't researched this extensively. These are just like some brief ideas. So if we figure we want to do this route. I can do some more research, and we can like talk offline about it. But I think doing some dance competitions would be good for you in terms of your awards. So

266
00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:50.119
Jenny Duan: Girl Scouts award the Volunteer Service award dance award, and then I think we have room for 2 more awards that we can build in. So one of them could potentially be like the distinguishing women's program. Another could be like the Nc wit aspirations and computing awards. So that's 2, and you only need 5 for the common app. So

267
00:52:50.700 --> 00:53:20.639
Jenny Duan: that could be an easy 2 to fill. I mean, obviously, there's no guarantee that we could get it. But the idea is that there are a lot of awards that are tailored towards you, that we can we can do. And then, in terms of the service. So, generally speaking, from your application on a holistic level, you have about 7 activities. So we have room for 3 more. One of these is probably going to be the summer program that you end up doing in summer between your junior and senior year. We'll talk more about what that looks like. So that will go on your activities list. And then you have 2 more. So

268
00:53:20.984 --> 00:53:22.710
Jenny Duan: right now. Oh, go ahead.

269
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:29.929
Neelam Rani: So, Jenny, a summit program is like one of activity. Would that count as a interest, or in that list.

270
00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:51.159
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that that counts in that list. Especially because a lot of the time summer programs hold significant way, especially if you get into a prestigious program like, a lot of the branding on a summer program like, if a college recognizes this, then, like, for example, a lot of people say, if you can get into Rsi, then you have, like a really good chance of getting into an Ivy League school just because these

271
00:53:51.290 --> 00:54:20.309
Jenny Duan: these programs are already so selective that they're an initial filter. So sometimes I like to think about the the summer program application process as kind of like a practice college application because you need letters of recommendation. You need to write down your activities. You need to write essays. And so it's a good benchmark to see whether or not you're on track for the schools that you want to apply for. And it's a relatively safe way of saying, like, Okay, either we're on track. We need to continue what we're doing. Or if we're not on track. Okay, we know early on.

272
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:37.630
Jenny Duan: so that we know that we need to shift. We need to pivot. We need to work on other things to like, make yourself more competitive for the actual season. So that's kind of the intention of a summer program. So it's twofold. It's 1st to get more experience. But it's also in a way, a way to test how you're doing in the strength of your profile, and if you have.

273
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:39.189
Arshiya Kalra: Too many activities. So like.

274
00:54:39.190 --> 00:55:04.739
Jenny Duan: Let's say you're you have more activities that you don't think that you have room to put a summer program. We can also list the summer program as an award, just because sometimes they're so competitive to get into that it can almost feel like an award like, oh, you gain this recognition of being accepted into this procedure summer program, and we can shift that to your award section, too. So there's always something we can do with it. But generally people like to put it in their in their activities list. Saraj, did you have something to add.

275
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:24.670
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean, I I can spare spend some more time like 5, 10 min, you know, because, especially like the kind of questions. It's very important that we also like highlight. You know, it's not about just getting. It's, I think competitiveness is just one aspect of it, right? Like it's not really about like, hey? Because the entire world then really thinks about Rsi, Ssp, and you know.

276
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:41.230
Siraj Nazir: And and this is where you know the kind of opportunities that Jenny is. Really, we really want to do things that others are not doing as simple as that. You want to stand out, do things that others are not doing, and you know, of course, not to say that you can't aim for some very competitive things. But let's be smart about it

277
00:55:41.260 --> 00:56:01.590
Siraj Nazir: right? I mean, you know one of the awards that we actually got another junior who started with us now, now a senior sherinity right? She came in very last. You know I don't typically take no, we don't typically take even Junior year to be very honest, because, you know, we need time, but I think you're still early in the in the year, and we got her. You know, Ronald Reagan award.

278
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:22.659
Siraj Nazir: Now, that's something that we really like, you know, Jenny. Basically, again, we work as a team again, just to be clear. Okay, like Jenny. We're not cloning Jenny, for everybody like you know, Jenny is like head coach, and but this is the kind of framework we have for everyone, and I'll spend some more time to just explain to you not to be, because, you know, I think you've been a victim. I've been a victim, you know. People ask me like, Why do I do this?

279
00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:47.409
Siraj Nazir: You know the problem chose me because I have struggled and I've gone through, and I think it's my responsibility. I'll spend some time, and I'll explain to you, you know, but the thing is execution execution. Now. Jenny spoke about 2 students, right that Jenny has helped. But again, let's be very honest, right. It takes like 10. And twenties of like. The number of applications these students have worked on is just simply amazing. Like, because

280
00:56:47.631 --> 00:56:56.280
Siraj Nazir: I can't even like might be, we should do some study and see like how many applications did they work on? But the biggest thing for me as a parent, because I've seen, like my daughter, go through that.

281
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.389
Siraj Nazir: It's just the process of

282
00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:14.680
Siraj Nazir: like evolution. Like, you know, she knows her narrative. She knows who she is. She has discovered herself in the process. She has now learned how to compete. And you know, one of the things that happened was that to a point where then she figured out the thing, and she applied, and she won the national award

283
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:31.430
Siraj Nazir: like, you know, this is where Jenny told me, Silage. I didn't tell anything like she did it on her own. That is what we want at the end of the day, and Jenny is like. Jenny tells me. What is success to me. I asked my coach, and Jenny was told me that the success is when the day that when I will come and I'll basically I want to come and say that I usher doesn't need my help.

284
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:33.820
Siraj Nazir: you know, like that's how we view it.

285
00:57:34.449 --> 00:57:57.420
Siraj Nazir: So don't worry about it. I think again not to overwhelm you. But you see, like this is like all like the point is really not the list. I mean, you don't even have to worry about it. And this will be this is the goal of the game plan. It really boils down to these 15 data points at the end of the day, like, you know, and we are working backwards. That's what Jenny's doing. Jenny's actually working like an admission officer saying like what actually has highest impact.

286
00:57:57.470 --> 00:58:15.589
Siraj Nazir: and she's aligning it with your profile. Right? That is, that's what. So now we will do work as a team. I think we'll come up with a plan. But then all the magic happens in execution. And this is the commitment I need see, because at the end of the day we are also very selective with students, because I want your success, you know, is critically important for our success.

287
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:24.059
Siraj Nazir: So you know, and you're competitive. You said you don't mind competition. I'm a type, a very competitive guy. And so we'll push you. Okay.

288
00:58:24.346 --> 00:58:53.579
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I want to leave a couple of minutes for questions. I hope this wasn't too overwhelming. But I think what I really want to emphasize is, 1st of all, like, we have very personalized programs like for you like the specific things that I'm showing you like, there's millions more. But it's like it's very tailored to fit your interest, and, like everyone, is different. And then I think the most important thing, though, that I want to say, is like college applications. The end goal is not about getting into a a dream college or a top 5 school like.

289
00:58:53.630 --> 00:59:17.229
Jenny Duan: and this sounds very counterintuitive, but I think for me the way that I see it is. You want to become the type of student that would attend the school, and that means you're you have the skills, you have the mindset and the foundation that you will be successful, no matter what. And so you want to be the type of student that naturally these types of schools attract because of your academics because of your hard work, because of the person you are. And so

290
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:32.309
Jenny Duan: I think that a lot of people go into colleges, and they feel like they got in because of luck. They feel over prepared, and then they're in college and they're overwhelmed, and they feel like they. Don't know what they do after college, because college is their only goal in life. But instead, we want to make you the type of person.

291
00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:46.010
Jenny Duan: the type of person that these schools would accept, and the type of student at whatever your dream school is. And so if we think about like the qualities of a top student at your Xyz dream school, that's like, probably someone who's hard working, who knows how to balance their time, who knows how to

292
00:59:46.010 --> 01:00:10.969
Jenny Duan: commit to a passion and to like follow through. And all of those factors are ultimately more important than the name itself? Because if you have those factors, the school will follow naturally, and you don't need to worry about only getting the stream school, and that's all you want in life. You want to become like a holistic, well rounded person that will be successful, and that these schools will naturally want. But anyways with that? Do you have any questions, or do you?

293
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:16.719
Jenny Duan: Does your mom have any questions about your path next steps and what we do here.

294
01:00:18.727 --> 01:00:20.519
Arshiya Kalra: Nothing from me.

295
01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:32.440
Neelam Rani: I have questions, and so you have listed down so much stuff like we could do right. Will you be following up on timelines with her, making sure she doesn't miss that stuff.

296
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:33.510
Neelam Rani: Oh.

297
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:53.060
Siraj Nazir: I can take it up, Jenny. I can take that. I'm sorry to interrupt. I think I want to spend some more time. I think so. This is not like this is part. This is the 1st session where, Jenny, because, you know, we we have a very kind of, you know a tiered team? Right? Of course, the the whole point is execution. We work as a team to draft. 1st come up with a game plan.

298
01:00:53.130 --> 01:01:13.629
Siraj Nazir: You know what what she's done is, she's asked enough questions, and I think you know she's done it fairly quickly, because, number one, you know, you're already kind of grown quite a bit in your journey. So you're not starting, like, you know, like Arab as an example, who's like 8th grade, you know. But this is like a very different story, right? So it depends on that. So I think there is like a bootstrap. You're, you know

299
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:31.349
Siraj Nazir: from a from a tech perspective, like we want to boost up and see, where can we take you next? And the game plan will be the kind of the North Star, and I'll show you a few examples I've I've shown you. It will be a weekly program, and then we'll also pair you now with the right coach right? Who will work with you on a weekly basis and see the way we work is

300
01:01:31.657 --> 01:01:36.549
Siraj Nazir: again. I I do not have like we don't go more than one is to 3 ratio.

301
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:51.440
Siraj Nazir: So in fact, even Jenny, like Jenny, actually, you know, she's a founding Pm, and you know, she's basically help, you know, been with us like throughout. But I think from a weekly execution perspective, it's only been these 2 girls that she's basically been focused on heads down.

302
01:01:51.880 --> 01:02:12.459
Siraj Nazir: Because it's heavy, heavy execution. You know, they have a lot of things. And now you know, they've gone through this whole 2 year journey. And now seniors are actually in that kind of crunch moment. So I you know there's just no way that you know. So. But then we have Srini and others like, you know, the amazing coaches. Right? So we it's a team. We work as a team collectively. So even like your award list as an example.

303
01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:27.559
Siraj Nazir: It's gonna be it will be debated in the team meeting like we will, we'll bring it up, and then they will always be a different point of view, right? Because, remember, like, you know, these are very brilliant students, and and that's what makes them. And but you know one thing that Jenny just said, it's absolutely true.

304
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:47.730
Siraj Nazir: something that you know. I've interviewed many, many Iv students, you know, before starting this whole thing. I was actually doing a lot of paid interviews like, you know, building a product perspective like at Howard mit the fact that the same thing that applies to entrepreneurship as well. Right like, you just can't become an entrepreneur just because you want to start a company. That's the wrong reason

305
01:02:47.760 --> 01:03:08.760
Siraj Nazir: and entrepreneurship happens, product market fit happens if you follow the passion and the problem, the space right? It's the same thing with these students that I've seen right? A lot of these success stories like, I know that, you know, it's very easy for Jenny to say, sitting at Stanford, that oh, yeah, you know college admissions not like, you know, application. But that's actually a reality that I see a common theme across. The students

306
01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:12.940
Siraj Nazir: don't be too stressed about, because if you focus on the right prep.

307
01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:15.399
Siraj Nazir: and you focus on the right execution.

308
01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:36.090
Siraj Nazir: Results will follow. I mean, that should be a that will be a by product. And I've seen that happen, you know. So. And we're not even talking about competitive students. We have struggled with very, very type B shy students, you know, who don't even like. So it will happen. Yeah, Jenny, I know that you're top of the hour, you know. I I can spend some 5 more. I I want to just like, kind of tell you what happens next. You know, from a program perspective.

309
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:51.069
Siraj Nazir: And also, yeah, that's that's perfectly so. Yeah. But typically I don't chime in in these sessions. This is completely like led by my coaches, you know, but I had to, because of the kind of the baggage you had, and you know it was very important for me to set the stage.

310
01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:04.780
Jenny Duan: Totally well. Super nice to meet you. Yeah, everything at Iv level is very team based. We all help each other, and, like the team has all people from different perspectives. So yeah, I'll let Sir Raj take it away. Thank you so much. Take care.

311
01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.039
Neelam Rani: So much, Jenny, that was nice meeting you.

312
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:36.359
Siraj Nazir: Everyone reports into Jenny. By the way, all the other coaches right? So we have, like Marisa, who's the biomed head coach. So the way. So I'm literally yeah. I've literally what I've done is again. You know, my kids and my parents. They all like, you know, like not not parents. My, my kind of in-laws make fun of me like, you know I'm I'm an ex apple pay, Google pay guy. And then what the hell are you doing like, you know? Working in this boring space of college prep. But you know, it's because of what your mom went through. I'm I'm a hurt problem.

313
01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:54.439
Siraj Nazir: i i i was a victim. And it's my payback time. You know, I want to pay back basically to the people who actually trick me, you know, on the system. It's a very, very, it's a very. It's a systemic issue. Actually, if you think about it right? So we are solving this. And and I hope you saw just a glimpse of the magic that happens. And and we have created this.

314
01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:16.100
Siraj Nazir: I don't market. I don't do anything. I have such a strong product market pool. You know I have many students who want to work, but I do not want to lower the quality. I want outcomes. I want students who can really fit in. I want to understand. You know, can can we drive this change? So for me, like, you know, personally, like Asha, we will do everything in our capacity. So you don't have to worry like, for example, you know, if there's a student who's working on a passion project.

315
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:30.090
Siraj Nazir: you know. And this is what actually makes us interesting because we have a very diverse team. We have bio, we have Cs, we have AI, we have symbolic, we have psychologists. We have data. Science like anything. The way we have built is you don't need hundreds of people.

316
01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:38.179
Siraj Nazir: You need brilliant people right. That is why the bar is too high. It's taken like we are not like a mentoring and tutoring service. People don't understand.

317
01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:45.720
Siraj Nazir: And the only reason that I had to, because I discovered that real talent that can actually make this change.

318
01:05:45.860 --> 01:06:01.090
Siraj Nazir: It was absolutely not the zeniths and the crimsons of the world. It was definitely not the counselors of the world, not even the adult teachers. There's no relatability. You need people who are relatable and who have been there and done that period. You want to be an entrepreneur. You work with the founder.

319
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:22.560
Siraj Nazir: You want to get into Google Apple like fan companies. You work with people who are hiring managers who have been to those companies right? As simple as that. It's a simple logic. Unfortunately, there's so much Fluff and Bs out there, and it again like hurts me. And that's what actually invigorates me that every time I hear another parent being a victim like I want to come back stronger like, let's change the game, anyway. So I think

320
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:24.250
Siraj Nazir: it's very simple now.

321
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:46.040
Siraj Nazir: So you know. Again I chimed in. And you know, I think we it's good that you have already you. You have a start right? I think the focus now is really to stand out, and I showed you a few things. I don't know if you saw it from the bus the other day you were commuting. But I I we like the the rubric is very simple. It's up. It's all about. Now stand up. What will help you stand up

322
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:50.310
Siraj Nazir: and definitely the things that you have spoken about.

323
01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:58.269
Siraj Nazir: including the research you're talking about, or you know, any other kind of debate, club or school club school club activities. Your grade. It's just a baseline.

324
01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:25.689
Siraj Nazir: In fact, it makes it actually harder to be very honest, right? Because if you think about it, you're from a competitive school, you are from a rich area, right. All that things actually does not help you. I think so. What we need to do is doesn't mean that people don't get in because I think the advantage of coming from a competitive private school would be that okay? The admission officers do believe the rigor right? And there's enough data point. But now it's all about. How are you different.

325
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:51.069
Siraj Nazir: So that's why we have to take things, and we have to really do things. And and Jenny is absolutely right. I never ever thought that my daughter would be doing something in journalism. But you know that is the standout for her today, because how many students like from Indian Bay area profile and personnel. Yeah, like Anushka example as an example foot science. Who's doing? But she got into? We we got her into 2 programs. One more, I think. The Smithsonian National level

326
01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.879
Siraj Nazir: again. Not, you know you have we? We will figure out things, but all I want you to know is.

327
01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:04.120
Siraj Nazir: I think less is more when it comes to the day to day. Kind of activities. Okay, like, where you're like, really being sucked into this

328
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:12.910
Siraj Nazir: and same thing, I'm actually struggling with, you know Araf's dad as well, I'm telling, you know, just because your school's offering all these clubs and activities and all this intensity, like, you know, I honestly don't care.

329
01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:22.159
Siraj Nazir: Our job is to do the 2 3 big ticket game changing innings. That's it. We want, like, you know, box office heads. That's it. We want box office hits. Actually.

330
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:24.390
Siraj Nazir: we want Toba Tova songs. Very.

331
01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:31.959
Siraj Nazir: no, really, honestly right. And we will do that. And social media could be one of the channels we have to think creatively. So.

332
01:08:32.644 --> 01:08:42.790
Siraj Nazir: one thing is, don't be worried about the semantics. Okay, the extracurricular activities don't look at it internship. And I went this with through Nelima as well, you know. I'll tell you.

333
01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:58.589
Siraj Nazir: You know Neelima is not a helicopter, mom, she's not like, you know, she basically had Anushka left her. And I I said that you know what my job is really to also like be that you know, bridge between parents, because I also push back parents. I said, You know, okay.

334
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.269
Siraj Nazir: please don't do this. You are going to harm your child the most. Your your playbook doesn't work.

335
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:07.049
Siraj Nazir: Let the people who know and who've been there and done that, let them do it.

336
01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:18.229
Siraj Nazir: and coaches will come back to me and say so. For example, one of the rest. And you know, anxiety starts building up and summer starts coming up, and they are in like parents are in Facebook. And you know I'm a you know, a parent myself. Right?

337
01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:30.490
Siraj Nazir: That's why I hate Facebook. Don't go away. Facebook. So Neilima comes January, and you know she does like an a call like an emergency call like Hey, Sraj? You know we haven't cracked anything for Anishka yet.

338
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.339
Siraj Nazir: It's January 1st week, and then I showed you she won 4 things back

339
01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:43.989
Siraj Nazir: week after week after week. So there was an anxiety right the parental love and anxiety, and what she did. She started applying to this internship. That internship. I'll talk to my friend this, this that

340
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:51.109
Siraj Nazir: she basically said, Okay, Anoushka is gonna get. And again, you know you don't have to quote me again. I want to be respectful. But just because, you know, Anushka.

341
01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:58.449
Siraj Nazir: she said, okay, I will get Anushka, you know she can get an internship at Kaiser permanente, because I have a friend who can do X-wise right.

342
01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:07.220
Siraj Nazir: And then I I basically I knew it. But again. i i i knew that that's so prohibitive. It's absolutely not needed.

343
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:16.060
Siraj Nazir: But I I really want the experts to say. And I said, You know, I don't know like, Tell me, how can I help? And then Jenny comes in and says directly onto like Neiliman says.

344
01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.390
Siraj Nazir: I mean, you're gonna harm. Your child's profile more.

345
01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:27.279
Siraj Nazir: because what is the connection? She's not into health. She's got nothing to do with that. But but again, see, the Indian parent will always think it to the skills perspective. Oh, it.

346
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:30.450
Siraj Nazir: you know, tech skills she did internship. You can't experience. No.

347
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:39.019
Siraj Nazir: we have to craft a narrative and story here. Everything should scream and say, this has the DNA.

348
01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:40.360
Siraj Nazir: You know off

349
01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.680
Siraj Nazir: a developer, a problem solver.

350
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:44.939
Siraj Nazir: a dancer.

351
01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:53.300
Siraj Nazir: This is the it should have a personality. Your application should have a personality. It's not a checklist. So adding things.

352
01:10:53.430 --> 01:11:08.049
Siraj Nazir: and, you know, kind of adding something which does not align with it will actually only handle. And and, by the way, you know what there are parents like students who come to us with 20 extra curricular activities, we, we start eliminating. We don't even submit full 10, because that will hurt them back.

353
01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:15.040
Siraj Nazir: The one thing you don't want to do see cohesive cohesive cohesive. It is about your identity, though the the beautiful thing is.

354
01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:33.330
Siraj Nazir: what is your passion? What is your aptitude? You see, you're already strong on aptitude. Right? You've got good grade. You have gone through that rigor. You don't have to see. Jenny did not speak about any Aps or anything else right like she's she's not worried about that. But the only thing she told you was on Psat. That's it. And that's more like, you know, a scholar like, you know, national merit and all that stuff.

355
01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:42.639
Siraj Nazir: everything else. She's basically like tapping into your your leadership. That's amazing. You know, this doesn't happen for everybody. I'll be very honest, neither. Anushka, neither. Huda.

356
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:45.080
Siraj Nazir: Leadership was always a weak spot for them.

357
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:56.650
Siraj Nazir: So the beauty is. But again they but they had, like other strengths. Right? So for you. We have to go. Go where what? You're positive we have to play to your strength.

358
01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:15.830
Siraj Nazir: Do not get sucked into things that others are doing. That's like, you know. I don't, because I did not even hear research as a really authentic thing. I don't know, like, you know, it's really that hurt fear that sucked you into it. Unfortunately, it's it's it's it's even if you had like a research paper published, probably we would have not put in there, because that clearly is a disconnect.

359
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.939
Siraj Nazir: We don't want disparate. We want profiles that speak.

360
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:29.689
Siraj Nazir: because at the end of the day I you know, she's only talking to you about like the 10 extracurriculars and the 5 awards. I'm talking to you about one step. After that the application goes to the admission officers.

361
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:38.390
Siraj Nazir: They are going to wreak your personal statement. It's not even necessary. What is your personal statement? It's your personality who you are as a person who's the person behind this application.

362
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.929
Siraj Nazir: Then they look at that story.

363
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:56.590
Siraj Nazir: Oh, when I read this personal statement, it's very clear she is. She wants to solve problems. She's a dancer, she's a creative person. She's Xyz. It's all coming. She's shown me through her words. Here, now let me look at the extra curricular list. Does that back that?

364
01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:03.729
Siraj Nazir: Oh, she talks about all this dance and Cs. And then she's done something here in health. I don't understand what's the connection.

365
01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:09.790
Siraj Nazir: And then she's gone to some research, and she's gone to some paid program and done some upscaling. This is no alignment.

366
01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.279
Siraj Nazir: so extracurricular is a proof.

367
01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.280
Siraj Nazir: It basically has to

368
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:38.740
Siraj Nazir: testify that these are the things aligned with your profile. So everything goes in very coincidence. So I think you don't have to worry about that. That is precisely the word that you know the coach. What will happen is the game plan will come out. We'll review it the next session when you do. And and I think we do have. Like, you know, I've I. I've basically discussed the team, and I think probably there are 2 2 kind of coaches who might be a good foot fit for you.

369
01:13:39.078 --> 01:14:01.309
Siraj Nazir: There's 1 you know. Julie, Huang, who's actually Cs you know, and and she's got a very strong. You know. She's also Stanford Cs. And we also have Aditi, who's also Stanford Cs. Now Aditi is helping Kaviya, and I think the reason why I thought about Aditi was because of the similar profile that she's helping like Kavia, right like you have, dancer. So the kind of profile is very similar.

370
01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:24.250
Siraj Nazir: But again, like I think because of your competitive profile. And you know Kaga is not very competitive, right? Like for her, like, it's more about you need to build confidence. She's not outgoing, so I think it's a very different personality, and Aditi is very relatable to her adity. Is very, very similar personality, but very confident. And all that stuff right? So I think Julie, in my view, can be a good, and I think probably she'll start with you.

371
01:14:24.567 --> 01:14:41.150
Siraj Nazir: What we're gonna do is come up with that game plan. And then it's gonna be 1.st First.st What we're gonna do is the one of the 1st things we do in our 1st program I showed you with my daughters, and also anish cause, like we do a 1, 68 h tally. It's really about. Now. It's all about execution which starts with 1st scheduling.

372
01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:58.029
Siraj Nazir: and it's a power of 1, 68 h in a week. What it means is, we'll have to say no to 1,000 things that's very important. You'll have to eliminate. I basically asked Araf to remove, you know his dad to remove him from the physics of, you know, physics, Olympia. He's enrolled him to like 3 more programs.

373
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:07.489
Siraj Nazir: I'm like, you're killing a child like, you know, we want him to basically compete for the Us. Congressional app, and she has been helping him. Let's focus on one or 2 big ticket items.

374
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:31.479
Siraj Nazir: and you, it will be very busy for you, I think what we need to do is to maximize your chances of getting into these. See, it is not just 10. By the way she started, she gave you some ideas. Right? This is a recurring process, like your mom knows you know it is us crumb. It's an agile process it will. The the backlog will keep increasing at 1 point. You might even have 30 opportunities, new opportunities. Just imagine! Like on top of her head. She has like 5

375
01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:44.619
Siraj Nazir: like, if you start working with our coaches and we cross pollinate, we work as a team. We have a database very highly curated and hand picked database. All these opportunities do exist, but it is really about optimizing it for your success

376
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:51.239
Siraj Nazir: on things that you can win. See, for example, like us Congressional app challenge. It's very hard to win from a bay area.

377
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:55.360
Siraj Nazir: because, you know, you have to think in the context of the game

378
01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:02.830
Siraj Nazir: like there are pros. But there are a lot of cons of being in a very competitive district like, so I think we will figure that out. Okay,

379
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:14.930
Siraj Nazir: So now it's all execution. So you know in fact, you know, I think you're probably the the soonest that have. We have started anyone because you know, typically, we want your form to be filled and we review it.

380
01:16:15.233 --> 01:16:32.990
Siraj Nazir: Then, you know, might be. Sometimes I also bring in like, say, for example, if if we think that it's Julie or Aditi, I would actually invite both of them, because I also want to see that kind of alignment coming. And you know, from the sometimes, you know, like coaches will actually just jump in as I. They'll say that I want this student.

381
01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:48.150
Siraj Nazir: because, you know, I mean, these are very, very passionate, and you know, very, very driven coaches. That's why it's very hard to find many. So we'll we'll do that. Don't worry about it, I think. I hope you were able to get a glimpse, you know, on what we mean by precision and specificity.

382
01:16:48.556 --> 01:16:54.893
Siraj Nazir: And personalization. You know, personalization is not just having one on one call. It's really like being that level, effective.

383
01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:08.679
Siraj Nazir: But now, yeah, I think you'll have to really manage things. I think it's all about here. I mean, I I've like I I've seen my daughter go through this. Of course you'll be challenged. You'll be pushed, but you also have to be smart. You know the biggest thing in this is

384
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.120
Siraj Nazir: time management.

385
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:16.959
Siraj Nazir: Saying no constant prioritization and reprioritization. Because you have like 3 application deadline.

386
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:33.200
Siraj Nazir: Right? You'll have to pick. I mean, it can't be like, you know, it's not not. Everything is created equal, and you have to consult, and the and the coach will come and say, You know it's perfectly fine you don't have to do X. Let's be prioritize. This might be, and see if it will apply next year, because, you know, you can also apply next year.

387
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:33.690
Arshiya Kalra: Yep.

388
01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:50.469
Siraj Nazir: By the way, like you know, Jenny is probably won like some 20 awards, but most of our awards apparently she she won after she applied to Stanford. So we started getting in after like, so it's all possible. Okay, so yeah, I think what I really want commitment from you. Asha, is this.

389
01:17:51.550 --> 01:18:09.489
Siraj Nazir: Every student for me is very important. Part of it's part of, you know, our startups journey. You know we are. We are small, we are 2 and a half years old. We have seen many successes. We have helped students get into, you know Cornell and Stanford. We have, you know, we even change decisions, flip decisions last year, so we will give every help.

390
01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:19.569
Siraj Nazir: But I want every student to win. I cannot afford. I'll be very honest. I cannot afford you know where. You know, a student is not putting in the effort to win.

391
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:20.230
Arshiya Kalra: Like.

392
01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:27.479
Siraj Nazir: I think it is important. And you know, just keep following and keep doing, and there will be times where you will not see results.

393
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:39.259
Siraj Nazir: you know. Up the karm. Go, you know. You will get the results, you know. That is what it is. It is Bhagavad Gita. At the end of the day. Just keep doing your work, I promise you. Results will come.

394
01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:47.780
Siraj Nazir: I promise you, as a parent, and I'm and this is more to like your parent as well. There are times where you will start feeling. Oh, my God! We applied to 10

395
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:51.410
Siraj Nazir: 10 rejections, you know. Rejection is a very important part of the process.

396
01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.159
Siraj Nazir: I you know I actually celebrate rejection more than when.

397
01:18:55.660 --> 01:19:15.260
Siraj Nazir: because you have to understand. That's also that shows your grit, your perseverance. You know, I I again keep repeating. Parents don't understand, and students don't understand. The biggest factor. 4 or 5 8th is overcoming adversity. Every time you go through this there is a reflection trail like you're reflecting. These stories are what eventually will get into your application.

398
01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:23.069
Siraj Nazir: and I don't even want to scare you on the application. You know the essays are many, many, many you are applying in common app. Everyone's got like a tailored app.

399
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:47.309
Siraj Nazir: So when you are sending to Darmouth like you'll have to figure out your kind of supplementary essay, and you'll have to talk about it. And you know it's never over right. So even if you get a deferral in early, then we will try to change the game for you. So see you will get all your best help. The only thing is, it will be overwhelming at times. And that's why I chimed in, you know, just because you get all this information doesn't mean that everything is.

400
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.680
Siraj Nazir: you know, something that, and you have to be smart about it. What is high return of investment?

401
01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.540
Siraj Nazir: Where do I put my effort?

402
01:19:54.660 --> 01:20:14.059
Siraj Nazir: Do not not again, I'm telling like, just don't get like that. You know that pied Piper like, you know. Rat race man, you you should never go to the rat race. I think that is, that is like every time you think like. And I'm glad you come with that mindset, because you were the one who came and said, You know what like, everyone's doing the same thing. So that moment, actually, that that realization itself is a big boon boon to us.

403
01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:19.510
Siraj Nazir: So keep that mindset. And let's do different things. There. There are many opportunities, I promise.

404
01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:38.570
Siraj Nazir: You know. You, your mom will send me an email, right? It's because it happens to be, you know, with every student. It happened even with Sri Nadhi Raghavan, you know, brilliant student from Virginia. She's got all her stem things done, and you know, guess what she did. She was in neuro research because her brother is autistic

405
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:46.609
Siraj Nazir: and what what happened was she? She spent all her time in Bio, in 9th and 10th 11 she comes. Her dad works as in data science.

406
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:50.220
Siraj Nazir: And she suddenly says that you know what I want to do data science, computer science

407
01:20:50.420 --> 01:21:02.669
Siraj Nazir: now. But again, her story is still because she thinks that with data you can solve neural disorders for her brother. She never told us. Mom never told. No one said anything about their brother to us.

408
01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:04.159
Siraj Nazir: 4 sessions gone.

409
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:09.540
Siraj Nazir: And then suddenly, my one of my coaches, Erin, you know who's data? Science? Stanford. Amazing brilliant.

410
01:21:09.826 --> 01:21:23.650
Siraj Nazir: You know. She's also been with me since Jenny's time, you know, I I like Jenny is not the only coach. There are many other coaches who are like the founding team. Right? So she basically comes. And she tells me that Sinaraj today, you know, somehow, she said, that her brother is autistic. I don't know why has this not been shared?

411
01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:28.350
Siraj Nazir: You have to bring out, and this is where the magic happens your coach should know about you.

412
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:52.590
Siraj Nazir: I'll tell you my daughter has not told anything, and once my daughter unleash her insecurities. Same thing with Anushka as well, Anushka was not doing. Jenny actually escalated to me and said, I feel like again, not in a bad way. I'll I'll tell you those barriers when they go away. You're not that kind of a person. I think you're already very outspoken and and outgoing, but you, you know, feel free to talk about the stresses you have at home.

413
01:21:52.750 --> 01:22:11.050
Siraj Nazir: and I'll I'll be very honest. I think Indians kids are like, somehow, you know, like, you know, there's this conservative kind of culture. You don't share a lot, but you think about like East Asian and South, like, you know, they're very, very open with their storytelling. They'll go on Linkedin, like, you know, like Jenny and others like that. Jenny will say that. You know my dad came to this country with $12 in his pocket. They're not afraid to say that

414
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:18.140
Siraj Nazir: what I want you is like, your your story is what will actually make it interesting. Okay, so share it with your code. That's why we want to bring that kind of pairing.

415
01:22:18.479 --> 01:22:28.360
Siraj Nazir: Your vulnerabilities are very important. If there is no vulnerability, there's no story. I'm sorry, but then there's no, there's no play. So your weakness is your biggest strength. Okay?

416
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:34.229
Siraj Nazir: Great. I mean, I I hope it's clear, like, you know, the program will will start executing now.

417
01:22:34.963 --> 01:22:39.169
Siraj Nazir: I'm really looking forward to have you know, celebrating our 1st win.

418
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:40.460
Siraj Nazir: Okay.

419
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.479
Neelam Rani: Thank you, Sinarat. So next session would be scheduled by Mary.

420
01:22:47.900 --> 01:23:05.850
Siraj Nazir: So I think yeah. May see again. The way of the scheduling. I really want a lot of discipline. Bi weekly at least like for the 24 week program but let's be very honest, like, you know. As a dad. I know that. You know there are peaks, and so you will have exam weeks, and then Stanford will have exam weeks and all that. But what is important is

421
01:23:06.103 --> 01:23:26.610
Siraj Nazir: to show up when you're actually fixing something, we have 2448 HII did not initially keep it, but some students just started, like, you know, changing it at their own will so definitely join. The other barrier I have seen is if students are not able to progress because I know what your life is like. Okay. So you don't have to like. I mean, I have a senior student with me. Okay, I I see her stress.

422
01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:36.030
Siraj Nazir: All I can tell you is actually, the moment where you are struggling more, you're not able to decide. You have 15 other things on your plate is actually the moment where you have to talk to your coach.

423
01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:48.969
Siraj Nazir: That is where you need their help. The most people don't get this right, and my daughter would tell me, oh, I haven't done this, Dad. This application is not ready like, I don't want to have this call. I'm like, this is exactly where you need the call to happen, because she will remove the barriers for you.

424
01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:55.770
Siraj Nazir: and what we need to do also remember, like, after the execution, like weekly, you know, send out an email. You have to be proactive.

425
01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.860
Siraj Nazir: either. You give them an update.

426
01:23:58.362 --> 01:24:14.840
Siraj Nazir: You know all you ask them questions. I think we'll try our best. I know a weekly support offline support is hard, you know, because they're like these students are also like busy. But we try to make that happen because because of our performance and incentive structure. You know, your coach will be vested in your success. That's something that I can vouch for right.

427
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:30.190
Siraj Nazir: because if you win, they win a lot. If you don't win, they get. They are okay, like they. They don't lose. But they are okay. But if they really want to win a lot like Jenny probably has made so much more that she probably can can't make you know elsewhere in any other kind of college prep. Service.

428
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:33.380
Siraj Nazir: So we have created a premium service

429
01:24:33.450 --> 01:24:40.429
Siraj Nazir: with a talent which unfortunately otherwise is seen as like cheap kind of mentors and tutors, which is true if you design it that way.

430
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:46.290
Siraj Nazir: It is not for cause that I've hired them. They probably make more than doctors, I'll tell you with their hourly rates.

431
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:50.770
Siraj Nazir: but they have that kind of that. That's the only place I could find a solution.

432
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:51.840
Siraj Nazir: Okay.

433
01:24:51.950 --> 01:25:17.630
Siraj Nazir: so yeah, so we'll do the scheduling. I would say initially, I would say back to back. Sessions are good, so don't worry about the the 24 week. You know whether it's bi weekly or you. You discuss with your coach, and you decide because initially, we want that rhythm to establish right? Because now you have the game plan, you you have the scheduling right in place. You're going to school. You're now completely bombarded with 100 things. And they're they're gonna tell you what not to do.

434
01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:19.259
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, like like that.

435
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:21.450
Siraj Nazir: So yeah.

436
01:25:21.994 --> 01:25:32.490
Siraj Nazir: Yeah. And don't worry. If there's a deadline that's going away. Okay, it's not the end of the world. That's why I chimed in for younger. See? Yeah, again, the thing also, you have to understand that these are very, very prestigious programs.

437
01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:33.010
Arshiya Kalra: You.

438
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:45.340
Siraj Nazir: You're not aware of it. I was not aware of it. They're still very competitive. Getting a young arts is not easy, you know. There are a lot of people who have spent years right? So it's also something that you have to discuss with your coach, and they will try to optimize it

439
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.890
Siraj Nazir: right?

440
01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:58.930
Siraj Nazir: But I'm I'm very impressed with the see. For example, like, you know, she spoke about the the police kind of chief AI resources and all that stuff you also have to understand. One thing like winning awards is not a mandate.

441
01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:10.750
Siraj Nazir: Showing impact is an important thing demonstrating your journey is important. Your community service and your Passion Project has much higher weightage. Just make that clear. Awards are still awards. Think about it.

442
01:26:11.168 --> 01:26:31.290
Siraj Nazir: I'll I'll just because of the kind of misconception around summer programs and all that stuff, especially for parents. For myself, summer program is still a summer program. Right? So you're applying getting in with your kind of other work, and you're getting in getting an award. Okay? Might be. You can say that I competed@someusa. core, or somewhere, like I worked on something, and I want. But still it's an event.

443
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:41.100
Siraj Nazir: Now compare that with the Passion Project and the community Service, where you say that you actually led an initiative, and you touch the lives of like that is high impact. That is what gets you in.

444
01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:47.119
Siraj Nazir: And I'll I'll show you a few coaches like there's 1 Riship Admanaban who actually helps our.

445
01:26:47.410 --> 01:26:54.160
Siraj Nazir: He did not have any prestigious awards or anything else, and he did not even do computer science in his. He's from Irvine

446
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:55.599
Siraj Nazir: public school, though.

447
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:57.120
Siraj Nazir: But what he did was

448
01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:06.900
Siraj Nazir: he basically led, you know, like, how in India, like, you know, we don't use and throw right like we, a phone gets repaired, we repair it yourself, and we reuse it

449
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:10.770
Siraj Nazir: in in us. It's you know, it doesn't allow that. Right? So what he did was

450
01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:13.550
Siraj Nazir: he, basically, you know, started a

451
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:19.919
Siraj Nazir: kind of a community service like an initiative nonprofit. And you would buy from ebay.

452
01:27:20.190 --> 01:27:29.389
Siraj Nazir: What's the high tech here like? It's not about technology, it's about impact. That's what I want to demonstrate. And it's not a brilliant idea, or a very different idea. Buy from ebay?

453
01:27:29.818 --> 01:27:33.099
Siraj Nazir: Then sell it for 300, after repairing with his team.

454
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:48.000
Siraj Nazir: you know, to other businesses, take that money and give it to other charity and other organizations. But that is very cliche and business as usual, too. What makes it Iv level what gets you into Stanford, because that's what the admission offices wrote. That Rishi, this is what got you into Stanford

455
01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:53.919
Siraj Nazir: is. He did not stop there, so he raised 25,000. 25,000. With that work

456
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:57.889
Siraj Nazir: he also went to the legislation, and he tried to pass a law

457
01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:01.230
Siraj Nazir: that everyone should have the right to repair their own phone in this country.

458
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:15.480
Siraj Nazir: Do you see the difference? It is about the depth you have to understand. It is about real impact. It is not about, you know. I made a landing page, and I did 15 h in, you know. Foot everyone goes to like foot kitchen, like you know, kitchen and then gives like. It's not about hours.

459
01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:23.270
Neelam Rani: So Sarah's question here, do do, admission, officer, come back and tell students why did they select them?

460
01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.159
Neelam Rani: Oh, I think.

461
01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:37.109
Siraj Nazir: They've stopped. They've stopped it from this year in some schools. So typically you know, what happens is you can request. So once you get into the top. Iv like typically these Iv schools, you can request that I would love to get my admission notes.

462
01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:38.100
Neelam Rani: Hmm.

463
01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:54.669
Siraj Nazir: You know. So what happens is they? You know, initially, they used to give you the package, and you could actually even read it, you know, like, you know, like where they circled in your essay, what ratings you got. So, for example, like all these people would know, and that's how I you know we have reverse engineered the rubric.

464
01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:09.449
Siraj Nazir: Rubric is not publicly known. Like, if you go to Stanford Howard, like all these rubrics, are very opaque. It's not like you know it's it's pretty much. I think you can even get like Google's rubric, Apple's rubric. You can't get like these colleges. Rubric. So the way you reverse engineer is like, Okay.

465
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:19.329
Siraj Nazir: I got in this much for my essays. I got this much for my extracurriculars, and then what really? And then they receive a circle, and they tell that this is a stand up. So you need one.

466
01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:22.100
Siraj Nazir: Boba Toba. Okay, you're a Bollywood dancer.

467
01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:32.358
Siraj Nazir: We need like one Toba Toa. Then that that is what. And I think ideas are great here. But remember that. So

468
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:44.529
Siraj Nazir: programs awards, don't be worried about it, even if you like. I'm I'm just setting the stage, because, you know, you will go through that journey. I've seen or add, I applied to 10 like, what should I do?

469
01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:50.290
Siraj Nazir: Just keep doing your job. Oh, now I've got suddenly 4. Wow! I won national award life changing. See?

470
01:29:50.390 --> 01:30:00.909
Siraj Nazir: If you did not work you would have not right. So the point is, it will come. But again, also, remember your passion Project. Your community service is a higher return of investment.

471
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:03.060
Siraj Nazir: Do not underestimate that.

472
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:16.599
Siraj Nazir: like you know, I think this is where students will get it. So I think you will quickly be able to define a passion project, be it applying AI to music or health. I don't know what it is that you will define a passion project. You will start working on it

473
01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:22.150
Siraj Nazir: and your community service as well, right, be it that police kind of angle or whatnot.

474
01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:34.300
Siraj Nazir: and you just go and do like a search. Rishi Padbalabar, you know you will see like his profile come up and you will see Rishi's project. You know. It's all over news and all that stuff, and we will work on that pr aspect, too.

475
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.599
Siraj Nazir: But we need impact before, right? So once you have impact, we'll try to figure that out.

476
01:30:38.630 --> 01:30:47.809
Siraj Nazir: So what what? You know? My, these the students are very, very smart. You know what they do when they build their portfolio. There's a lot of marketing branding that needs to happen. Eventually. We'll do that.

477
01:30:49.447 --> 01:30:54.439
Siraj Nazir: we'll have portfolio pages and all that stuff just like Anushka and Huda. You know they have their stuff. We are working on it.

478
01:30:54.550 --> 01:31:07.149
Siraj Nazir: and they have trackers as well. So Rishi would tell me that. Hey? You know what? During my admissions Yale spent 2 min on my page, you know. Stanford spent 3 min on my page. So it's all the data that that I'm telling you. Right? So don't worry about it.

479
01:31:07.997 --> 01:31:16.809
Siraj Nazir: I think every coach also has a very different. So, for example, if you meet Aditi, Aditi comes from a very stem kind of extracurricular profile.

480
01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:21.720
Siraj Nazir: If you talk to, you know if Julie is your coach, then? Julie basically, is from Michigan.

481
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:25.939
Siraj Nazir: So she is not from Bay Area. She's from Michigan, but the amount of

482
01:31:26.479 --> 01:31:39.959
Siraj Nazir: Cs work she's done is simply remarkable. I was like, I'm like, oh, I can't even think of like a Bay area student doing this like tech parent learning. She doesn't even like have tech parents. But what she did was at her level. She went and she figured out

483
01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:50.699
Siraj Nazir: women hackathons like Michigan hackathons, you know Atlanta hackathons. See, the question they want to ask is your relative, you see, like how she's asking you? How do you compare? It's all relative.

484
01:31:50.740 --> 01:32:02.300
Siraj Nazir: and that is unfortunately, the challenge, you know. And you know, if you were to redo this like, I have different suggestions. Right? You know I would recommend parents to actually move, not to a competitive school. That's a different story. If you really want to play the game.

485
01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:07.529
Siraj Nazir: the reality is, you will be compared with your related performance, and to a similar person like

486
01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:19.950
Siraj Nazir: Arshiya might be a girl, but similar. So with this kind of resources and funding where you could actually do 17 Aps, and these many clubs and all that stuff. How many people have really gone to like a jail, and you know, like.

487
01:32:20.190 --> 01:32:22.489
Siraj Nazir: you see, that already is a standout.

488
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:26.510
Siraj Nazir: So you you that is what you'll be compared against. Right?

489
01:32:26.936 --> 01:32:41.279
Siraj Nazir: Anyways, I I really want, because, you know, that's why I I wanted to know, like you know what your struggles are. You didn't find opportunity. Don't be worried, you know, internship like, even if you bring an internship and your parents bring an internship, our coaches will tell. No, if it does not align.

490
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:43.310
Siraj Nazir: Internship is not the goal.

491
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:45.540
Siraj Nazir: So yeah.

492
01:32:47.430 --> 01:33:00.030
Siraj Nazir: awesome. I'm I'm super excited, you know. Of course, you know I'm I'm not gonna show up again. I think you'll only see congratulations email coming from me. And you know your parents are reaching out to me. You'll be in plans. Don't worry about it. Okay.

493
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:00.710
Arshiya Kalra: Yeah.

494
01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:01.730
Siraj Nazir: Welcome! Take care!

495
01:33:01.730 --> 01:33:04.040
Neelam Rani: Thanks so much. Yeah, me, too.
