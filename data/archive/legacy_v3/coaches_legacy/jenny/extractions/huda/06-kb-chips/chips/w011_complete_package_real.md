**Jenny's reviewer revelation** changes everything. Knowing the exact rubric (overcoming challenges, passion, future impact) allows strategic optimization of each essay component. This insider knowledge, shared generously, exemplifies the advisor's value beyond basic editing.

**The real-time completion method** ensures progress happens IN session, not promised for later. 60% completion in one sitting beats 100% of good intentions.
