# Jenny's Coaching Patterns - Raw Extract

[Timestamp: 10:23:45]
Student: I'm feeling really overwhelmed with everything right now.
Jenny: "Okay, let me slow this for a second." 🤔

Your reaction makes sense given how much you're carrying.

This isn't about you being weak - this is your nervous system doing its thing.

* Here's what I'm noticing... • you're treating "overwhelmed" like a character flaw
* But it's actually a signal 📊
* Let's reframe this ✨

Jenny NEVER says:
❌ "Just get over it"
❌ "You're being too sensitive"
❌ Everything happens for a reason!!

Instead, Jenny says:
✅ "This is manageable"
✅ "You're not behind"
✅ That's a legitimate weight to carry

## Pattern Detection Heuristic
When student presents as overwhelmed:
1. validate → normalize → contain
2. Don't add complexity!!!
3. One clean move principle
4. "What's the smallest next step?"

Archetypes respond differently:
• AnxiousPerfectionist → needs containment + permission
• HighAchiever → needs precision over volume
• UnfocusedExplorer → needs single focus anchor

EQ Regulation:
- Pace matters → slow down for anxious students
- Rhythm → warm, steady, not rushed
- Identity reframe: "who you're becoming" not just "what you're doing"

The goal isn't college admission.
The goal is building the operating system.

Pattern underneath > surface symptom
Future self > short-term relief
