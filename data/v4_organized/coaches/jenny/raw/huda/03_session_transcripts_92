How are you? 2 00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.769 huda: I'm good. How are you? 3 00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:40.949 Jenny Duan: Awesome. So I think let's spend like 5 min going over your interview were, and then talking about his background, and then we'll go into the into the like mock interview. Okay? So you've done research on your interviewer. Tell me about him. What does he do as his background? Tell me. 4 00:00:41.881 --> 00:01:09.530 huda: So he got his bachelor's and Master's degree from Mit, and he studied administration or business, and then currently he's an associate chancellor for sustainability at Uci. So he's led a bunch of initiatives on sustainability efforts, reducing kind of energy usage in labs. And actually, now Uci is recognized for being 5 00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.300 huda: really great for sustainability. And so he was also, like the 6 00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:32.799 huda: the Vice Chancellor for Ucsc. And Uc. Irvine. So he's been in charge of finance and administration and some topics that he's really passionate about are sustainability, energy, efficiency, climate action and green campus development. 7 00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome and anything else that you feel like. It's important to share about him or no. 8 00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:45.410 huda: There wasn't much information besides his line of work in sustainability. 9 00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.930 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 10 00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.490 Jenny Duan: Okay, ready? 11 00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.510 Jenny Duan: Right? 12 00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.430 Jenny Duan: Okay. 13 00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:11.609 Jenny Duan: Cool. Hi, Huda. It's great to meet you today. I'm Jenny, and I'll be conducting your interview. I understand you're interested in applying to Mit, and I'm excited to learn more about you and your passions 14 00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:37.479 Jenny Duan: before we dive in. Let's start with a brief introduction. Why don't I start by introducing myself? And then I'd love to learn a little bit more about you. I am a Vice Chancellor at Ucsc. I'm very interested in sustainability, and that's the area I work in. I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I graduated from Mit, and now I'm living in the Bay area which I see you're also from. Tell me a little bit about yourself. 15 00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:50.919 huda: So, hey, Jenny, I just wanted to start off by. Thank you, thanking you for the time, taking up the time to interview me today. It means a lot to me. But I guess to sum it all up, I'm a journalist, game developer and AI ethics advocate. 16 00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:08.450 huda: So I was born in Dubai, and I eventually moved 12 schools in my entire life. So across 2 continents, and that meant a lot of changing curriculums and different learning platforms. So that kind of became a problem for me. But eventually I did settle down in Mountain House, California. 17 00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.139 huda: We're a small rural town in Norcal. 18 00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:24.060 huda: So not exactly part of the Bay Area, but still Norcal and I go to Mountain House High School, and I'm really involved in the Cs program and the media arts program. So our Cs and media arts program aren't exactly 19 00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:49.390 huda: robust or set yet, because we are a new school, and we're from a rural area. So I've kind of been helping the teachers come up with new lessons and new plans. But with Cs I work on projects and helping lessons and with media arts. I do weekly student news, so broadcast journalism. And I also lead the filmmakers, club and the podcast club. 20 00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:56.409 huda: So a lot of student journalism and also local journalism. So I interview local small businesses. 21 00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:07.610 Jenny Duan: That's really cool. And I definitely think that being involved in education and journalism is super important. I'm wondering, like this year what what are the new sources that you're reading. 22 00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:35.980 huda: I'm very keen on Al Jazeera. I think they have a really great representation of all issues currently across the world. I think. Besides political factors. There's tons of information on sustainability efforts, especially new developments that are happening in the world. And I really love the reporters. Honesty, and you know truth about everything. 23 00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.660 Jenny Duan: That sounds cool. I'll be sure to check that out. What platform is that on again? 24 00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.850 huda: It's a website and news channel, called Al Jazeera. 25 00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.970 Jenny Duan: Cool. 26 00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:52.679 Jenny Duan: Well, do you have any questions about Mit or the application process? So far. 27 00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:03.820 huda: Yeah, I actually did have a couple questions about Mit. I was wondering if there's anything about Mit's culture that kind of took you by surprise, going in. 28 00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:26.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that obviously, I went to Mit a long time ago. But when I was there I was really surprised by how collaborative everyone was. And I think that at a lot of institutions maybe they get the reputation that it's everyone for themselves, especially in stem. I know that at least when I graduated Stem was super competitive. I know that as you're applying for 29 00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:39.279 Jenny Duan: your major is also very competitive as well, but when I was there. I was really surprised at Mit's collaborative atmosphere, and also how easy it was for students to work on research projects and even spin out startups together. 30 00:05:40.150 --> 00:06:07.310 huda: Yeah, I think that's a wonderful environment. And I think that's exactly what I need. Actually, I was doing some research on Mit, and I was quite surprised to see that it wasn't all stem, because when you think of Mit, you usually don't think of media or arts. But the specific program that I'm applying to, which is comparative media. I think it's really just like a great dialogue between stem technology as well as communications. 31 00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:13.250 huda: Which is exactly why, I think Nyc. Is a great place to continue those. 32 00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:22.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that kind of brings me into my next question, which is, why are you applying to Mit? Or why do you want to go to Mit? 33 00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:47.050 huda: Yeah, I think so. For one, as I mentioned, I think Mit is really a continuous dialogue between stem technology and communications. And I think there's actually a story about Mit, where some students made the dome into Captain America's shield. And I think, while that is really funny, I also think that it really goes to show that 34 00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:58.260 huda: Mit is a place where there's collaboration. They have humor, and they're immensely creative. And I think that's kind of the environment that I believe I would thrive in, because 35 00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:16.299 huda: I'm someone who wants to create the next solutions to the problems of the world. And I think with creativity, humor and teamwork. That's exactly the environment. But in specific with the program that I'm applying to which is comparative media studies, I think it's a program where 36 00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:44.229 huda: you can really talk about not just how media works and how to make media, but also about the impact of media. And I think that's kind of what sets it apart. There's a course called fans and fan Cultures, which talks about kind of the impact of media on subcultures in the United States throughout the world. And I think that's just not offered anywhere else. And I think that's what makes this program so special, because 37 00:07:44.230 --> 00:08:01.459 huda: I'm not just learning how to make media. But I'm working on how it can affect the world. Because media is, you know, a platform where you can change perspectives, where you can create narratives and everything like that. And I just think that's so special. And it's not offered anywhere else. 38 00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:27.119 Jenny Duan: Yeah, when I was at Mit, one of my favorite classes was called building rockets and their representation in film. And one thing that I really like about Mit. That you just described is how interdisciplinary it is. And I like what you said earlier about how Mit isn't just a stem school. I like how at Mit, people are able to work together, and there's also encouragement for electives like 39 00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:52.909 Jenny Duan: students try to get their pirate's license. They take sailing. They take fencing like mit students are really curious, and always up to shenanigans. So I remember when I was in college we would always do the craziest adventures, and I think that that's probably the same in student life. Right now I'm curious. What are your academic interests at school, and what have been some of your favorite classes during High School. 40 00:08:53.690 --> 00:09:11.750 huda: Yeah. Well, at school I enjoy taking all courses, but I think one course that really stood out to me. My entire high school career has been media arts, I think, starting off high school. I've been a very quiet, shy person, and I was really scared to be perceived by others. 41 00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:32.419 huda: and in media arts they kind of push us to go away from that. And I think one thing that they made us do is do broadcast journalism. So every week it would air to 2,500 students, and I'd have to show my personality. I'd have to speak to people, and I think that was just one of my biggest fears at the time. 42 00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:48.799 huda: But taking the class, I think it's definitely changed. My perception of myself, my overcoming my fear of talking to other people being perceived. And yeah, I think that's been the most interactive, impactful class. 43 00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:56.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And other than that. What are some other like academic interests that you have? And how did you get into them? 44 00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:10.599 huda: Yeah. So I think one thing that I'm really, really interested in was my statistics class, which kind of introduced me to the world of data science. And so with data. 45 00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:30.470 huda: I think a lot of people don't realize that numbers can speak stories. And I think that's a really big special nuance that not a lot of people realize because data is used in visualizations. And it's really used to tell a lot of stories. So for example, if we take, like 46 00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:41.389 huda: a representation of how many trees there are in the world. And then what the global temperature is, then if we if someone sees the decline of the of the 47 00:10:42.150 --> 00:11:03.189 huda: the increase of the world temperature because of the lack of trees. They're more inclined to, you know. Be careful with like environmental efforts. So I think data tell stories, and especially visualization can shape how we view the world. And I think statistics has been my way of learning that. 48 00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:13.160 Jenny Duan: That's cool. What's like? Do you have one statistical problem that you're most interested in learning more about, or solving at Mit or in the future? 49 00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:36.000 huda: Yeah, I think, well, I think there's a lot of data that isn't represented in today's media. And I think that needs to be tackled. So, for example, I'm really interested in ancestral data for South Asians, I think there's not enough data out there. And I know it's kind of difficult to get data that wasn't recorded back in the time. 50 00:11:36.000 --> 00:12:04.890 huda: But I think there's just so much lack of representation for whether that's for South Asians, whether that's through people with backgrounds which didn't have the technology back then. And I think that's something that I'm really interested in exploring. But I think another thing that I'm also about data is data and AI ethics. Sorry AI is trained using data. But sometimes that data is not really representative of groups. 51 00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:22.039 huda: And I think that's something that needs to be tackled. And as Mit likes to explore the outward actions and the the really world implications of problems, I think AI ethics is something I want to explore at Mit. 52 00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:46.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I know that right now. Generative AI is all the rage, and I'm sure that that's the case with learning as well. I know that a lot of people in classrooms and we've been dealing with this at Ucsc. And Uci are trying to learn how to adapt to learning in the age of Chat Gpt. Lama, Claude, all these language models out there. Have you been following this trend? And what do you think about it? 53 00:12:47.340 --> 00:13:00.289 huda: Yeah, I I think that learning is evolving. And you know, 2030 years ago we didn't know that learning will be on computers. We thought we didn't even know computers existed at the time. So I think that 54 00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:17.560 huda: this is a cutting edge issue, but also a solution. Because with AI, there are negative impacts, like some people might take the shortcut and try to learn through AI, and but I think it could also be used as a solution. 55 00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:39.287 huda: So I actually, as I mentioned, I'm a game developer. So I actually did develop a video game teaching AI ethics and machine learning and basic data science concepts. And I think a lot of years ago we wouldn't have considered a video game to be educational. It's just a pastime. It's something that people do on a Friday night. And I think, 56 00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:56.449 huda: so we see technology kind of changing and like how we use technology. So I think with AI especially, there's so much potential for greatness, and I think more opportunity for learning different concepts simplified so that everyone can understand. 57 00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.589 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that's very important. 58 00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:09.790 Jenny Duan: so I'm curious. I know that you're interested in AI, and you're interested in data. I know you're interested in Media. I'm curious. 59 00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.679 Jenny Duan: What have you done to pursue these passions in high school? 60 00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.160 Jenny Duan: What are some of the extracurriculars that you do. And how do you spend your time outside of school? 61 00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:42.250 huda: Yeah. So I like to joke that when I'm in school I'm learning. But when I'm outside of school I'm teaching. So I guess I'm always at school, so I think, for one, the biggest accomplishment that I have is teaching my younger brother how to ride a bike this past summer, because he's a tough guy. So it's really hard to teach him things. 62 00:14:42.250 --> 00:15:07.030 huda: But I think other than that there's many activities and almost everything I do relates to teaching people. So, as I mentioned, I did develop a video game teaching AI ethics and machine learning. But along with the video game, I also created a lesson toolkit, and it's fit to California standards. And I've distributed this to over 200 classrooms in the United States. 63 00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:36.769 huda: So it's been magical seeing teachers reaching out to me, telling me about their experiences, teaching it in class and everything like that. And then, besides video games, I've also done different initiatives like founding, empowering. AI. It's an organization that I founded to teach young girls about AI and AI ethics again, but through workshops and hackathons this time, and fortunately we've been able to fundraise $23,000 64 00:15:36.770 --> 00:16:03.730 huda: and have panelists from Google and Nvidia. So I think that's been pretty successful. And other than that, I do a lot of other activities such as teaching at the English Language development classroom, where we have 36 immigrants from around the world. So people from South Korea. There's people from Mexico, and they all kind of don't know English don't know how to write it don't know how to understand it. 65 00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:13.319 huda: and I think in my free time at school I like to go into the classroom and help the teacher, you know. Speak to these students and have a 1 on one with them. 66 00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:28.789 huda: And I think this is really special to me, especially because I'm an immigrant myself. So I was learning English, moving into this country as well, and it's been kind of like a full circle moment helping other people learn English. Yeah. 67 00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:37.249 Jenny Duan: Oh, and out of all these experiences what's been the most rewarding aspect, or what have you felt most proud of. 68 00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:50.009 huda: I think personally, I've felt most proud of empowering AI, and I think I don't know if I mentioned, but my starting founding journey was pretty much started off. 69 00:16:50.010 --> 00:17:12.769 huda: based off of this Hackathon club at school. It was kind of a very exclusive club. There was maybe 3 or a handful of girls in the club, and we didn't get any opportunities for leadership, or, you know, mass representation at hackathons. And so I guess I felt kind of shy to be part of these events. 70 00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:31.140 huda: but founding empowering. AI. I was kind of nervous, and I was thinking, what if this doesn't gain any traction? What if this kind of fails. But with the help of my team, we've been able to do pretty great and inspire students from across the world. So yeah, I think I'm most proud of that. 71 00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.449 Jenny Duan: That's super awesome. And what has been like, maybe the most challenging part of building that. 72 00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:56.420 huda: I think it's definitely part of it is my quiet nature, I think being a founder means you have to speak. You have to open ceremonies for hackathons. You need to lead workshops, and I think at 1st I was really nervous, because again, with the fear of being perceived. 73 00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:19.909 huda: I think, speaking to that many people from across the nation across the whole world. I think that's been really scary for me, and that for one was one of my biggest fears going in, but also just being like a young founder being, I did this at 1716 years old. I had to email executives from large companies for fundraiser opportunities. 74 00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.959 huda: I think that was also one of my biggest fears going in. 75 00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:32.790 huda: but I think this experience has kind of grown me, and I think I've grown as a person, and I've gone more confident and stronger through this process. 76 00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:48.660 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that public speaking is, I think, always going to be scary. I'm 50 years old, and I still think that public speaking is terrifying, but I think it's probably one thing that we'll all have to get over and work on. So it's very impressive that you're doing that at 17 years old. 77 00:18:49.216 --> 00:19:03.610 Jenny Duan: One thing that I'm kind of curious to learn more about is, what do you like to do for fun? So I know you're an AI ethics superstar. You're working on your nonprofit. But when you're not doing all of that, what do you do for fun? 78 00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:33.739 huda: So I love filmmaking. I'm actually the president of my filmmakers club at my school. And so annually we like to film short films. Usually they have a unique twist on them. Last year we did a breaking bads twist, but you know a school friendly version, and then we did a take on among us the popular video game. So we kind of like to do a lot of writing. We do the script, writing ourselves. We do the camera work ourselves. 79 00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:57.609 huda: And our actors are all just students from our school. So I think it's really fun to have be in that really like makeshift, that kind of environment and creating something from that. And so I love videography. And as I mentioned with media arts, I get to interview people. And eventually I just love creativity through the art of visual media. 80 00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.459 Jenny Duan: What filmmakers inspire you! The most. 81 00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:11.920 huda: I'm really inspired by Sofia Coppola. She is a wonderful filmmaker, she directed. Priscilla. 82 00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:39.540 huda: and I think one thing that I did want to mention is that film has such a great power to kind of shape our narrative because we got 2 different movies about the Elvis family. We got Elvis, and then we have Priscilla. And then our perceptions of the characters really just change based off the film. So it's really the magic of the filmmaker. That kind of you can create narratives. You can change perspectives. I think that's that's magical. 83 00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:46.669 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and what movies? What was your favorite movie this year? I haven't seen Priscilla yet, but I'm going to add that to my list. 84 00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:49.631 huda: My favorite movie this year. 85 00:20:50.080 --> 00:21:02.630 huda: was probably there was a cartoon called The Wild Robot. It came out recently. It was about this robot that is kind of training this bird how to fly and migrate. 86 00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:28.409 huda: and it's kind of a analogy for mothers sending their child off to college because their whole task, their whole life, is to kind of take care of the child, and then they're going off to their new goals and new plans, and especially this year, because I'm going off to college soon. It was really emotional. And I just love the filmmaking of that film specifically. 87 00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:58.369 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And I think I've heard a little bit about it. I have a nephew who's really into cartoons right now, and I think it's also cool to see more technology weaved into movies. And to see, like the relationship between humans and technology, whether that's, you know, horror, movies or movies like the wild robot which kind of paints technology in more of a friendly way. I'm curious like in the future. What do you hope our and all of humanity's relationship with technology looks like, based on your experiences. 88 00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:27.379 huda: I think that it should work in parallel. I don't think that AI should replace humans. I don't think that humans should replace AI. I think that AI is essential, and it's a new creation that it's been created for a reason, and it's been there to make our lives easier, but also to improve our lives. Right? So I think I want to see solutions like. 89 00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:53.409 huda: for example, if I want to do my laundry, I want the AI to do my laundry while I'm going out and solving the problems of the world. I would not like to see the robot solving the problems out of the world while I'm doing my laundry. So I think that's kind of the stance that we need to take in the future and building solutions that allow humans to continue being the leaders that they are. But we know that AI is 90 00:22:53.410 --> 00:23:06.200 huda: kind of evolving all the time. So we know that its abilities are also evolving. There's lots of dangers we know with generative AI. There's tons of risks that come with it, but I think the solutions are often overlooked. 91 00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:13.760 huda: and we see so many good things coming out of AI. So I continue. I hope that continues throughout the future. 92 00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:21.550 Jenny Duan: Makes sense. And how long do you think it's going to take before we get generative, AI, or do you think we'll reach generative AI at all? 93 00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:49.289 huda: I think generative AI is coming sooner than most people think, because we already have Sora. We have so many new AI models, so generative AI is so soon because we have, like Tesla as well. The Tesla, the company. They have so many new inventions that we wouldn't have even dreamed of a couple years ago. So I think it's coming sooner than most people think. 94 00:23:50.490 --> 00:24:02.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I definitely agree. I mean, I've been following AI throughout my career, and I've seen how new large language models are able to adapt and improve and go beyond just 95 00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.602 Jenny Duan: repetition to cognition or cognition like things. 96 00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:29.240 Jenny Duan: so one thing that I'm wondering is, so you're a college senior. You're almost done with high school and throughout high school. You know you've spent some time in the pandemic. I know that high school has not been a very easy time for your generation. So I'm curious like, if you could redo High School again, would you change anything about your experience? 97 00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:49.929 huda: I think I'm very glad with how my high school experience turned out. I'm really glad with how what I made of things, but I think if I were to start over high school, I think there's a lot of things that I would have done. So. For example, I would get involved with more technology and more media arts program 98 00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:59.209 huda: beginning in freshman year. Because I think, starting out in freshman year, I was really kind of unsure of what I wanted to do. I was figuring things out. 99 00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:23.350 huda: And so I knew that I wanted to go somewhere in technology. But I always disregarded my love for media. So I always just kind of put it on the back burn, and I just did it for fun. But I didn't realize that it's going to be my biggest passion in a couple years, and now I think it's 1 of the things that I'm really passionate about, and that I know I want to do in the future. So I think for one, I want to be more involved with Media when I was 100 00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:35.715 huda: a freshman, and I also want to go out and make more friends. Because I think collaboration is so, so, so individually important, because 101 00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:59.939 huda: I think a lot of the projects that I've worked on synthoria folklift. Those have been kind of solo projects on my own, and while I do appreciate, like the hard work that I kind of put in, and, like all the effort that I put in for the projects, I believe it would have been more fruitful if I could have worked on it with more people. So I think that those are the 2 things that I would change about my high school experience. 102 00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:08.010 Jenny Duan: And what was the hardest part of high school, or what was the biggest challenge that you encountered during high school. 103 00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:30.539 huda: I think just the exclusivity of it all, the competition at high school. And I do love competition because I feel like it pushes people to go further. But I do feel like, especially with clubs and extracurriculars. School is just a very hostile environment where people are gatekeeping 104 00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:42.039 huda: kind of the opportunities that they have. So, for example, when I tried joining the Msa program, the Muslim Student Association, they don't have any officer roles for any of the Muslim women. 105 00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.709 huda: And that really kind of threw me off. 106 00:26:45.850 --> 00:27:08.159 huda: and I was very kind of unsure of myself after that, because I didn't know if I would belong anywhere if I didn't have an officer position in a Muslim role, because that's who I identify. As so. I think just the whole exclusive nature of high school has been really tough for me, but I think through my other extracurriculars, I've been able to overcome that. 107 00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:28.919 Jenny Duan: Yep, that makes a lot of sense, all right. Thank you so much for your time today I'm curious. I've loved learning about you, and it seems like you have really great interests that could be a good fit at Mit. I'm curious if you have any final questions before we wrap up this interview today. 108 00:27:30.063 --> 00:27:37.340 huda: Yeah. I was wondering if there were any traditions at Mit that you particularly loved, and that you really enjoyed. 109 00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Have you heard about hacking at Mit. 110 00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.320 huda: Beaver hacks. 111 00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:48.814 Jenny Duan: So mit students have this tradition where they really like 112 00:27:49.440 --> 00:28:10.844 Jenny Duan: breaking into buildings. I don't know if they do this still and climbing in the air ducts and finding like secret rooms. And Mit has these secret rooms all over campus people scale buildings to find them. People set up couches in them, and they're kind of hangout spots, and students will go late at night, and they call it hacking, so they'll go late at night, and they'll go 113 00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.439 Jenny Duan: climb buildings, they'll find they'll 114 00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:20.809 Jenny Duan: break into aerodox, and I don't know if I'm even supposed to be telling you this, but that was one of the highlights of my mit experience. For sure. 115 00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.659 huda: Yeah. Well, I'm excited to do hacking when I go to. If I get into mit. 116 00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.090 Jenny Duan: Thank you again. Have a great rest of your day. 117 00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.194 huda: Thank you, you too. 118 00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:35.031 Jenny Duan: Stay on the call. And okay, here's hacking. By the way. 119 00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.009 huda: Oh, wow! 120 00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.154 Jenny Duan: It's kind of cool. 121 00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:46.100 Jenny Duan: But okay, great job. Let's talk about that. How did it feel? 122 00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:52.749 huda: I feel like I messed up at some parts, and I was really nervous about that. But yeah. 123 00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.890 Jenny Duan: Are you wearing? What is this? Are you wearing a Harvard sweatshirt. 124 00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.340 huda: No, it was. It's just Hilfiger. 125 00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.860 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, okay, cool. 126 00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.662 Jenny Duan: I would say. 127 00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:11.350 Jenny Duan: maybe don't wear this tomorrow. Maybe wear like a plain colored thing, because it's too or not tomorrow, but during your interview, because I think it's too 128 00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.950 Jenny Duan: close to Harvard, like age in the colors. 129 00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:21.050 Jenny Duan: I think so. I would try to change into something just like a neutral color. If you can. 130 00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:33.090 Jenny Duan: Anyways, I think you did a great job. So what were the moments that you thought? We can debrief it now? So what were the moments you thought were challenging, or that you felt stuck. 131 00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:40.766 huda: I think that the academic interest, I think I started talking about data science. But then and then, when you ask for like 132 00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:48.280 huda: like, what specific data question I'm really interested in. I kind of just like blocked on that one. I didn't really know how to answer it. 133 00:29:48.540 --> 00:30:11.651 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I was gonna say for that one. I would suggest, that one I think you can practice or like come up with an answer for. And then I think one thing that you should emphasize a little bit more in your responses is just like I think you can be a little bit more nerdy, or you can find some more technical jargon, especially maybe when talking with about AI or about data science, like, I think, 134 00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:40.030 Jenny Duan: A lot of your answers came across as really professional, which is like a good way to put it. But I think for this type of interview, especially for Mit. They want to see people who can really like Nerd out about something or like get really passionate, and then like, start talking on a tangent about something for a long time, and I think that you shouldn't be afraid to do that in an interview like I think an interview is a setting, where, if you feel really passionate about a topic, you can should be able to like, talk about it for a long time, and they should be able to see the passion like 135 00:30:40.190 --> 00:31:08.230 Jenny Duan: like, let me demonstrate to you like this would be an example of me talking in a normal tone and in a normal, like professional conversation that I might use for a job interview. But for an Mit interview I might go off this tangent because I'm really really excited about this topic, and I might talk a little bit faster. Maybe not this fast. But I might talk a little bit faster to indicate that I'm super excited about a topic, and that I have this like big intellectual curiosity. And that's different from this tone, which is more like straightforward and formal. 136 00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.649 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense in terms of like phone. 137 00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:29.939 Jenny Duan: So obviously, don't do your whole interview in the really fast talking tone, and don't talk too fast. But I do think they want to see like your character, like change, or like you really get excited about a topic because Mit is a school like for nerds. So you should be able to like get really excited about a nerdy thing. 138 00:31:30.739 --> 00:31:53.899 Jenny Duan: The other thing I was wondering is, I think, that in a lot of your responses or not in a lot. But I think towards the end you started saying like, how you know you're the president of this, and this I think that the focus shouldn't necessarily be on your role or your leadership title, but rather like, I think your leadership will come across when you talk about like what you organize. So instead of saying like, and the president of 139 00:31:54.178 --> 00:32:02.519 Jenny Duan: film club, you can say, like, at school, I lead the film club this year. We did this, and they talk a little bit about it in a more like. 140 00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:03.780 Jenny Duan: I guess 141 00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:12.640 Jenny Duan: collaborative tone, instead of emphasizing your leadership like, I think your leadership will come out when you talk about what you do, so you don't have to say your titles. 142 00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:14.290 huda: Okay. 143 00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.149 Jenny Duan: But I think like it's still good to say like I found it empowering. AI. 144 00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.809 Jenny Duan: But I don't think you need to 145 00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:26.000 Jenny Duan: like overly emphasize your titles, because I think your leadership will come across naturally. 146 00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.969 Jenny Duan: Were there any other parts that you felt were a little bit sticky or hard for you. 147 00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.109 huda: Let me see. 148 00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:43.529 huda: I think I don't. Do you think I answer the favorite class question properly? 149 00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:56.219 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think so. I think that that makes sense to me. I think, like with the favorite class question, it's just an intellectual curiosity question. So as long as you keep up like the 150 00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:12.570 Jenny Duan: like curiosity and like intellectual interests that was good, and I liked how you I think I don't know if it was in response to this question, but at some point you connected it to what classes you were interested in taking at Mit, or what you were interested in learning at Mit. I thought that that was really good. 151 00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:18.129 huda: Yeah, I think that was the like the y. Why mit one. 152 00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:36.199 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I liked your response for Ymat a lot. I think that in terms of your biggest regret in high school, I think that exclusivity is, I think, maybe not what I would say, because I feel like it sounds more like a social challenge than like a high school challenge. 153 00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:43.420 Jenny Duan: So for that response. I don't know. Would you? Are there any other challenges that come to mind. 154 00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.398 huda: I wasn't sure how to respond to that one. 155 00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:58.255 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think maybe we can come up with like a new answer for that. 156 00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:19.319 Jenny Duan: I think that talking about your background is something that you didn't really mention as much as I thought you would have like saying, how like I think you can talk about how Mountain House doesn't have as many resources, and how you had to like search outside Mountain House to like learn these different things. And I also think you didn't mention J. Camp in this interview, but I think that you should talk about J. Camp at some point. 157 00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:19.860 huda: Here. 158 00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.090 huda: True. 159 00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 160 00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:32.830 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I think that for, like the challenge in high school, I would talk about like how Mountain House is a little bit rural and like how? There's not as many opportunities there. 161 00:34:37.529 --> 00:34:42.409 Jenny Duan: And then, were there any other things. 162 00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.820 huda: We're like the questions like 163 00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.670 huda: fine like, do you think they should be more like unique or. 164 00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:56.960 Jenny Duan: No, I think it was great. I loved your 1st question, especially. Yeah. 165 00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:15.587 huda: Okay? And my kind of like, like when when you 1st say, can like, introduce yourself. Do you think that was like a okay introduction or so. So I do say that, like I moved to all schools across 2 continents. Which led to inconsistent education. 166 00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:29.154 huda: I don't know. I don't think I got to like. I think I forgot to kind of like like elaborate on that, because I was gonna kind of segue into like. That's how I was like passionate about making education accessible. 167 00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.420 huda: But I don't know if you noticed that. 168 00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:42.959 Jenny Duan: I think that that definitely. I think that that came out. And I think that your passion there came out so I think that that was that was good. I don't have any thing to say about that. 169 00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.120 huda: Okay? And do I need to. 170 00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:54.350 huda: So wait. Okay, I still need to kind of work on my answer for like the specific data question that I'm interested in. 171 00:35:55.510 --> 00:36:00.540 huda: Because I feel like I don't really know if my responses like fit. 172 00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:09.624 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I guess you the data you talked about the like representation in media, right? But 173 00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:17.669 Jenny Duan: let's think, I mean, what questions do data scientists answer? 174 00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:49.910 Jenny Duan: maybe one thing that I mean when I think about this question, some things that come to mind are maybe the fact that like Chat Gpt is running out of training data and like, what are we going to do with generative AI models? If you want to talk about AI ethics you could talk about like sustainability and data centers like how they contribute to pollution, especially in places like Virginia, California, and how they challenge the Us. Power grid. That's 1 approach you can think about. 175 00:36:50.370 --> 00:37:05.520 Jenny Duan: You can also talk about privacy and surveillance like, in how personal data is collected and stored especially that you could reference the Tiktok ban that people have been talking about or like Facebook's data privacy, 176 00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:20.440 Jenny Duan: like lawsuits and things like that. So I would try to. I would try to reference some like current developments that are happening either with like Chat Gpt, or maybe Facebook or Tiktok, just to show that you're on top of the news. 177 00:37:21.509 --> 00:37:23.309 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 178 00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.420 Jenny Duan: Any other questions. 179 00:37:27.248 --> 00:37:29.789 huda: No, I think, for now. 180 00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:39.959 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. I feel like you did really good. And you sounded very eloquent. So, yeah, I think congratulations. There, I feel like the biggest 181 00:37:41.160 --> 00:38:05.569 Jenny Duan: the biggest things I would say to change, or just in some of your answers, bring out that enthusiasm a bit more like I feel like you don't need to temper yourself with your responses. And then, second of all, just practice the specific questions that we talked about a little bit more like the data question the like, the what was the biggest challenge in high school question, and then, I think, be a little bit more 182 00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:22.519 Jenny Duan: like, don't really emphasize your well, do emphasize your leadership, but you don't need to talk about your titles or name. Drop the titles as much. Yeah, that sounds. I think everything should be good. Your interview should go from. It's about 30 min right? Did this? Is that the time range they gave you. 183 00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:29.900 huda: Let me check exactly, but I believe they said like, let me see. 184 00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.480 huda: Yeah, it's supposed to be from 9 to 9, 30. 185 00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.190 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. So yeah, it'll be like, 30 min. 186 00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:49.152 Jenny Duan: could be a little bit longer. But 187 00:38:49.990 --> 00:39:02.190 Jenny Duan: probably not gonna be too long. Yeah, okay, that sounds great. Good luck. How are you feeling? Was this helpful? Do you feel more prepared? Do you feel more stressed like. 188 00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:14.380 huda: I think I feel a little more prepared. And also I was wondering if like, I can have like a list of things that I want to mention. Like I I kind of forgot about mentioning J. Camp, but I wanna. 189 00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.310 Jenny Duan: I think your extracurriculars list should just be the thing that. 190 00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.409 huda: Just like all of them. 191 00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:30.200 Jenny Duan: No, no, not all of it, but just like whatever comes up. But I think Jcamp synthoria empowering. AI should be like top of mind and folklift. But I think just Jcam synthoria and empowering AI, and then 192 00:39:30.445 --> 00:39:54.789 Jenny Duan: you can kind of weave other things in, and then also like don't be afraid to like, get a little bit more impersonal or personal, like can share some other things like that you do in your life that maybe aren't reflected, because the whole point is like they're trying to capture who you are outside of your college application, too. So like the things that you said about like helping your brother, like all those things that they might not know about you just by reading your application. I think you should work on emphasizing those as well. 193 00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:55.930 huda: Okay. 194 00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:01.709 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, well, good luck it's on, is it? On Friday or Saturday? 195 00:40:02.632 --> 00:40:04.020 huda: It's on Friday. 196 00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:10.400 Jenny Duan: Friday. Okay, let me know how it goes afterward. And yeah, good luck, and just be yourself. 197 00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.850 huda: Okay. Thank you. Bye. 198 00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:13.860 Jenny Duan: Bye.",

How are you? 2 00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.769 huda: I'm good. How are you? 3 00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:40.949 Jenny Duan: Awesome. So I think let's spend like 5 min going over your interview were, and then talking about his background, and then we'll go into the into the like mock interview. Okay? So you've done research on your interviewer. Tell me about him. What does he do as his background? Tell me. 4 00:00:41.881 --> 00:01:09.530 huda: So he got his bachelor's and Master's degree from Mit, and he studied administration or business, and then currently he's an associate chancellor for sustainability at Uci. So he's led a bunch of initiatives on sustainability efforts, reducing kind of energy usage in labs. And actually, now Uci is recognized for being 5 00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.300 huda: really great for sustainability. And so he was also, like the 6 00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:32.799 huda: the Vice Chancellor for Ucsc. And Uc. Irvine. So he's been in charge of finance and administration and some topics that he's really passionate about are sustainability, energy, efficiency, climate action and green campus development. 7 00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome and anything else that you feel like. It's important to share about him or no. 8 00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:45.410 huda: There wasn't much information besides his line of work in sustainability. 9 00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.930 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 10 00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.490 Jenny Duan: Okay, ready? 11 00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.510 Jenny Duan: Right? 12 00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.430 Jenny Duan: Okay. 13 00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:11.609 Jenny Duan: Cool. Hi, Huda. It's great to meet you today. I'm Jenny, and I'll be conducting your interview. I understand you're interested in applying to Mit, and I'm excited to learn more about you and your passions 14 0",
    "0:02:11.670 --> 00:02:37.479 Jenny Duan: before we dive in. Let's start with a brief introduction. Why don't I start by introducing myself? And then I'd love to learn a little bit more about you. I am a Vice Chancellor at Ucsc. I'm very interested in sustainability, and that's the area I work in. I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I graduated from Mit, and now I'm living in the Bay area which I see you're also from. Tell me a little bit about yourself. 15 00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:50.919 huda: So, hey, Jenny, I just wanted to start off by. Thank you, thanking you for the time, taking up the time to interview me today. It means a lot to me. But I guess to sum it all up, I'm a journalist, game developer and AI ethics advocate. 16 00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:08.450 huda: So I was born in Dubai, and I eventually moved 12 schools in my entire life. So across 2 continents, and that meant a lot of changing curriculums and different learning platforms. So that kind of became a problem for me. But eventually I did settle down in Mountain House, California. 17 00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.139 huda: We're a small rural town in Norcal. 18 00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:24.060 huda: So not exactly part of the Bay Area, but still Norcal and I go to Mountain House High School, and I'm really involved in the Cs program and the media arts program. So our Cs and media arts program aren't exactly 19 00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:49.390 huda: robust or set yet, because we are a new school, and we're from a rural area. So I've kind of been helping the teachers come up with new lessons and new plans. But with Cs I work on projects and helping lessons and with media arts. I do weekly student news, so broadcast journalism. And I also lead the filmmakers, club and the podcast club. 20 00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:56.409 huda: So a lot of student journalism and also local journalism. So I interview local small businesses. 21 00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:07.610 Jenny Duan: That's really cool. And I definitely think that being involve",
    "d in education and journalism is super important. I'm wondering, like this year what what are the new sources that you're reading. 22 00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:35.980 huda: I'm very keen on Al Jazeera. I think they have a really great representation of all issues currently across the world. I think. Besides political factors. There's tons of information on sustainability efforts, especially new developments that are happening in the world. And I really love the reporters. Honesty, and you know truth about everything. 23 00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.660 Jenny Duan: That sounds cool. I'll be sure to check that out. What platform is that on again? 24 00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.850 huda: It's a website and news channel, called Al Jazeera. 25 00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.970 Jenny Duan: Cool. 26 00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:52.679 Jenny Duan: Well, do you have any questions about Mit or the application process? So far. 27 00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:03.820 huda: Yeah, I actually did have a couple questions about Mit. I was wondering if there's anything about Mit's culture that kind of took you by surprise, going in. 28 00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:26.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that obviously, I went to Mit a long time ago. But when I was there I was really surprised by how collaborative everyone was. And I think that at a lot of institutions maybe they get the reputation that it's everyone for themselves, especially in stem. I know that at least when I graduated Stem was super competitive. I know that as you're applying for 29 00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:39.279 Jenny Duan: your major is also very competitive as well, but when I was there. I was really surprised at Mit's collaborative atmosphere, and also how easy it was for students to work on research projects and even spin out startups together. 30 00:05:40.150 --> 00:06:07.310 huda: Yeah, I think that's a wonderful environment. And I think that's exactly what I need. Actually, I was doing some research on Mit, and I was quite surprised to see tha",
    "t it wasn't all stem, because when you think of Mit, you usually don't think of media or arts. But the specific program that I'm applying to, which is comparative media. I think it's really just like a great dialogue between stem technology as well as communications. 31 00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:13.250 huda: Which is exactly why, I think Nyc. Is a great place to continue those. 32 00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:22.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that kind of brings me into my next question, which is, why are you applying to Mit? Or why do you want to go to Mit? 33 00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:47.050 huda: Yeah, I think so. For one, as I mentioned, I think Mit is really a continuous dialogue between stem technology and communications. And I think there's actually a story about Mit, where some students made the dome into Captain America's shield. And I think, while that is really funny, I also think that it really goes to show that 34 00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:58.260 huda: Mit is a place where there's collaboration. They have humor, and they're immensely creative. And I think that's kind of the environment that I believe I would thrive in, because 35 00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:16.299 huda: I'm someone who wants to create the next solutions to the problems of the world. And I think with creativity, humor and teamwork. That's exactly the environment. But in specific with the program that I'm applying to which is comparative media studies, I think it's a program where 36 00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:44.229 huda: you can really talk about not just how media works and how to make media, but also about the impact of media. And I think that's kind of what sets it apart. There's a course called fans and fan Cultures, which talks about kind of the impact of media on subcultures in the United States throughout the world. And I think that's just not offered anywhere else. And I think that's what makes this program so special, because 37 00:07:44.230 --> 00:08:01.459 huda: I'm not just learning how to make media. But I",
    "'m working on how it can affect the world. Because media is, you know, a platform where you can change perspectives, where you can create narratives and everything like that. And I just think that's so special. And it's not offered anywhere else. 38 00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:27.119 Jenny Duan: Yeah, when I was at Mit, one of my favorite classes was called building rockets and their representation in film. And one thing that I really like about Mit. That you just described is how interdisciplinary it is. And I like what you said earlier about how Mit isn't just a stem school. I like how at Mit, people are able to work together, and there's also encouragement for electives like 39 00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:52.909 Jenny Duan: students try to get their pirate's license. They take sailing. They take fencing like mit students are really curious, and always up to shenanigans. So I remember when I was in college we would always do the craziest adventures, and I think that that's probably the same in student life. Right now I'm curious. What are your academic interests at school, and what have been some of your favorite classes during High School. 40 00:08:53.690 --> 00:09:11.750 huda: Yeah. Well, at school I enjoy taking all courses, but I think one course that really stood out to me. My entire high school career has been media arts, I think, starting off high school. I've been a very quiet, shy person, and I was really scared to be perceived by others. 41 00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:32.419 huda: and in media arts they kind of push us to go away from that. And I think one thing that they made us do is do broadcast journalism. So every week it would air to 2,500 students, and I'd have to show my personality. I'd have to speak to people, and I think that was just one of my biggest fears at the time. 42 00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:48.799 huda: But taking the class, I think it's definitely changed. My perception of myself, my overcoming my fear of talking to other people being perceived. And y",
    "eah, I think that's been the most interactive, impactful class. 43 00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:56.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And other than that. What are some other like academic interests that you have? And how did you get into them? 44 00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:10.599 huda: Yeah. So I think one thing that I'm really, really interested in was my statistics class, which kind of introduced me to the world of data science. And so with data. 45 00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:30.470 huda: I think a lot of people don't realize that numbers can speak stories. And I think that's a really big special nuance that not a lot of people realize because data is used in visualizations. And it's really used to tell a lot of stories. So for example, if we take, like 46 00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:41.389 huda: a representation of how many trees there are in the world. And then what the global temperature is, then if we if someone sees the decline of the of the 47 00:10:42.150 --> 00:11:03.189 huda: the increase of the world temperature because of the lack of trees. They're more inclined to, you know. Be careful with like environmental efforts. So I think data tell stories, and especially visualization can shape how we view the world. And I think statistics has been my way of learning that. 48 00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:13.160 Jenny Duan: That's cool. What's like? Do you have one statistical problem that you're most interested in learning more about, or solving at Mit or in the future? 49 00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:36.000 huda: Yeah, I think, well, I think there's a lot of data that isn't represented in today's media. And I think that needs to be tackled. So, for example, I'm really interested in ancestral data for South Asians, I think there's not enough data out there. And I know it's kind of difficult to get data that wasn't recorded back in the time. 50 00:11:36.000 --> 00:12:04.890 huda: But I think there's just so much lack of representation for whether that's for South Asians, whether that's through people wit",
    "h backgrounds which didn't have the technology back then. And I think that's something that I'm really interested in exploring. But I think another thing that I'm also about data is data and AI ethics. Sorry AI is trained using data. But sometimes that data is not really representative of groups. 51 00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:22.039 huda: And I think that's something that needs to be tackled. And as Mit likes to explore the outward actions and the the really world implications of problems, I think AI ethics is something I want to explore at Mit. 52 00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:46.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I know that right now. Generative AI is all the rage, and I'm sure that that's the case with learning as well. I know that a lot of people in classrooms and we've been dealing with this at Ucsc. And Uci are trying to learn how to adapt to learning in the age of Chat Gpt. Lama, Claude, all these language models out there. Have you been following this trend? And what do you think about it? 53 00:12:47.340 --> 00:13:00.289 huda: Yeah, I I think that learning is evolving. And you know, 2030 years ago we didn't know that learning will be on computers. We thought we didn't even know computers existed at the time. So I think that 54 00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:17.560 huda: this is a cutting edge issue, but also a solution. Because with AI, there are negative impacts, like some people might take the shortcut and try to learn through AI, and but I think it could also be used as a solution. 55 00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:39.287 huda: So I actually, as I mentioned, I'm a game developer. So I actually did develop a video game teaching AI ethics and machine learning and basic data science concepts. And I think a lot of years ago we wouldn't have considered a video game to be educational. It's just a pastime. It's something that people do on a Friday night. And I think, 56 00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:56.449 huda: so we see technology kind of changing and like how we use technology. So I think with AI especi",
    "ally, there's so much potential for greatness, and I think more opportunity for learning different concepts simplified so that everyone can understand. 57 00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.589 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that's very important. 58 00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:09.790 Jenny Duan: so I'm curious. I know that you're interested in AI, and you're interested in data. I know you're interested in Media. I'm curious. 59 00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.679 Jenny Duan: What have you done to pursue these passions in high school? 60 00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.160 Jenny Duan: What are some of the extracurriculars that you do. And how do you spend your time outside of school? 61 00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:42.250 huda: Yeah. So I like to joke that when I'm in school I'm learning. But when I'm outside of school I'm teaching. So I guess I'm always at school, so I think, for one, the biggest accomplishment that I have is teaching my younger brother how to ride a bike this past summer, because he's a tough guy. So it's really hard to teach him things. 62 00:14:42.250 --> 00:15:07.030 huda: But I think other than that there's many activities and almost everything I do relates to teaching people. So, as I mentioned, I did develop a video game teaching AI ethics and machine learning. But along with the video game, I also created a lesson toolkit, and it's fit to California standards. And I've distributed this to over 200 classrooms in the United States. 63 00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:36.769 huda: So it's been magical seeing teachers reaching out to me, telling me about their experiences, teaching it in class and everything like that. And then, besides video games, I've also done different initiatives like founding, empowering. AI. It's an organization that I founded to teach young girls about AI and AI ethics again, but through workshops and hackathons this time, and fortunately we've been able to fundraise $23,000 64 00:15:36.770 --> 00:16:03.730 huda: and have panelists from Google and Nvidia. So I",
    " think that's been pretty successful. And other than that, I do a lot of other activities such as teaching at the English Language development classroom, where we have 36 immigrants from around the world. So people from South Korea. There's people from Mexico, and they all kind of don't know English don't know how to write it don't know how to understand it. 65 00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:13.319 huda: and I think in my free time at school I like to go into the classroom and help the teacher, you know. Speak to these students and have a 1 on one with them. 66 00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:28.789 huda: And I think this is really special to me, especially because I'm an immigrant myself. So I was learning English, moving into this country as well, and it's been kind of like a full circle moment helping other people learn English. Yeah. 67 00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:37.249 Jenny Duan: Oh, and out of all these experiences what's been the most rewarding aspect, or what have you felt most proud of. 68 00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:50.009 huda: I think personally, I've felt most proud of empowering AI, and I think I don't know if I mentioned, but my starting founding journey was pretty much started off. 69 00:16:50.010 --> 00:17:12.769 huda: based off of this Hackathon club at school. It was kind of a very exclusive club. There was maybe 3 or a handful of girls in the club, and we didn't get any opportunities for leadership, or, you know, mass representation at hackathons. And so I guess I felt kind of shy to be part of these events. 70 00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:31.140 huda: but founding empowering. AI. I was kind of nervous, and I was thinking, what if this doesn't gain any traction? What if this kind of fails. But with the help of my team, we've been able to do pretty great and inspire students from across the world. So yeah, I think I'm most proud of that. 71 00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.449 Jenny Duan: That's super awesome. And what has been like, maybe the most challenging part of building that. 7",
    "2 00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:56.420 huda: I think it's definitely part of it is my quiet nature, I think being a founder means you have to speak. You have to open ceremonies for hackathons. You need to lead workshops, and I think at 1st I was really nervous, because again, with the fear of being perceived. 73 00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:19.909 huda: I think, speaking to that many people from across the nation across the whole world. I think that's been really scary for me, and that for one was one of my biggest fears going in, but also just being like a young founder being, I did this at 1716 years old. I had to email executives from large companies for fundraiser opportunities. 74 00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.959 huda: I think that was also one of my biggest fears going in. 75 00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:32.790 huda: but I think this experience has kind of grown me, and I think I've grown as a person, and I've gone more confident and stronger through this process. 76 00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:48.660 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that public speaking is, I think, always going to be scary. I'm 50 years old, and I still think that public speaking is terrifying, but I think it's probably one thing that we'll all have to get over and work on. So it's very impressive that you're doing that at 17 years old. 77 00:18:49.216 --> 00:19:03.610 Jenny Duan: One thing that I'm kind of curious to learn more about is, what do you like to do for fun? So I know you're an AI ethics superstar. You're working on your nonprofit. But when you're not doing all of that, what do you do for fun? 78 00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:33.739 huda: So I love filmmaking. I'm actually the president of my filmmakers club at my school. And so annually we like to film short films. Usually they have a unique twist on them. Last year we did a breaking bads twist, but you know a school friendly version, and then we did a take on among us the popular video game. So we kind of like to do a lot of writing. We do the script, writing ourselve",
    "s. We do the camera work ourselves. 79 00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:57.609 huda: And our actors are all just students from our school. So I think it's really fun to have be in that really like makeshift, that kind of environment and creating something from that. And so I love videography. And as I mentioned with media arts, I get to interview people. And eventually I just love creativity through the art of visual media. 80 00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.459 Jenny Duan: What filmmakers inspire you! The most. 81 00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:11.920 huda: I'm really inspired by Sofia Coppola. She is a wonderful filmmaker, she directed. Priscilla. 82 00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:39.540 huda: and I think one thing that I did want to mention is that film has such a great power to kind of shape our narrative because we got 2 different movies about the Elvis family. We got Elvis, and then we have Priscilla. And then our perceptions of the characters really just change based off the film. So it's really the magic of the filmmaker. That kind of you can create narratives. You can change perspectives. I think that's that's magical. 83 00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:46.669 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and what movies? What was your favorite movie this year? I haven't seen Priscilla yet, but I'm going to add that to my list. 84 00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:49.631 huda: My favorite movie this year. 85 00:20:50.080 --> 00:21:02.630 huda: was probably there was a cartoon called The Wild Robot. It came out recently. It was about this robot that is kind of training this bird how to fly and migrate. 86 00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:28.409 huda: and it's kind of a analogy for mothers sending their child off to college because their whole task, their whole life, is to kind of take care of the child, and then they're going off to their new goals and new plans, and especially this year, because I'm going off to college soon. It was really emotional. And I just love the filmmaking of that film specifically. 87 00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:58.369 Jenny",
    " Duan: Yeah. And I think I've heard a little bit about it. I have a nephew who's really into cartoons right now, and I think it's also cool to see more technology weaved into movies. And to see, like the relationship between humans and technology, whether that's, you know, horror, movies or movies like the wild robot which kind of paints technology in more of a friendly way. I'm curious like in the future. What do you hope our and all of humanity's relationship with technology looks like, based on your experiences. 88 00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:27.379 huda: I think that it should work in parallel. I don't think that AI should replace humans. I don't think that humans should replace AI. I think that AI is essential, and it's a new creation that it's been created for a reason, and it's been there to make our lives easier, but also to improve our lives. Right? So I think I want to see solutions like. 89 00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:53.409 huda: for example, if I want to do my laundry, I want the AI to do my laundry while I'm going out and solving the problems of the world. I would not like to see the robot solving the problems out of the world while I'm doing my laundry. So I think that's kind of the stance that we need to take in the future and building solutions that allow humans to continue being the leaders that they are. But we know that AI is 90 00:22:53.410 --> 00:23:06.200 huda: kind of evolving all the time. So we know that its abilities are also evolving. There's lots of dangers we know with generative AI. There's tons of risks that come with it, but I think the solutions are often overlooked. 91 00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:13.760 huda: and we see so many good things coming out of AI. So I continue. I hope that continues throughout the future. 92 00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:21.550 Jenny Duan: Makes sense. And how long do you think it's going to take before we get generative, AI, or do you think we'll reach generative AI at all? 93 00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:49.289 huda: I think gene",
    "rative AI is coming sooner than most people think, because we already have Sora. We have so many new AI models, so generative AI is so soon because we have, like Tesla as well. The Tesla, the company. They have so many new inventions that we wouldn't have even dreamed of a couple years ago. So I think it's coming sooner than most people think. 94 00:23:50.490 --> 00:24:02.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I definitely agree. I mean, I've been following AI throughout my career, and I've seen how new large language models are able to adapt and improve and go beyond just 95 00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.602 Jenny Duan: repetition to cognition or cognition like things. 96 00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:29.240 Jenny Duan: so one thing that I'm wondering is, so you're a college senior. You're almost done with high school and throughout high school. You know you've spent some time in the pandemic. I know that high school has not been a very easy time for your generation. So I'm curious like, if you could redo High School again, would you change anything about your experience? 97 00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:49.929 huda: I think I'm very glad with how my high school experience turned out. I'm really glad with how what I made of things, but I think if I were to start over high school, I think there's a lot of things that I would have done. So. For example, I would get involved with more technology and more media arts program 98 00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:59.209 huda: beginning in freshman year. Because I think, starting out in freshman year, I was really kind of unsure of what I wanted to do. I was figuring things out. 99 00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:23.350 huda: And so I knew that I wanted to go somewhere in technology. But I always disregarded my love for media. So I always just kind of put it on the back burn, and I just did it for fun. But I didn't realize that it's going to be my biggest passion in a couple years, and now I think it's 1 of the things that I'm really passionate about, and that I know I want to",
    " do in the future. So I think for one, I want to be more involved with Media when I was 100 00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:35.715 huda: a freshman, and I also want to go out and make more friends. Because I think collaboration is so, so, so individually important, because 101 00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:59.939 huda: I think a lot of the projects that I've worked on synthoria folklift. Those have been kind of solo projects on my own, and while I do appreciate, like the hard work that I kind of put in, and, like all the effort that I put in for the projects, I believe it would have been more fruitful if I could have worked on it with more people. So I think that those are the 2 things that I would change about my high school experience. 102 00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:08.010 Jenny Duan: And what was the hardest part of high school, or what was the biggest challenge that you encountered during high school. 103 00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:30.539 huda: I think just the exclusivity of it all, the competition at high school. And I do love competition because I feel like it pushes people to go further. But I do feel like, especially with clubs and extracurriculars. School is just a very hostile environment where people are gatekeeping 104 00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:42.039 huda: kind of the opportunities that they have. So, for example, when I tried joining the Msa program, the Muslim Student Association, they don't have any officer roles for any of the Muslim women. 105 00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.709 huda: And that really kind of threw me off. 106 00:26:45.850 --> 00:27:08.159 huda: and I was very kind of unsure of myself after that, because I didn't know if I would belong anywhere if I didn't have an officer position in a Muslim role, because that's who I identify. As so. I think just the whole exclusive nature of high school has been really tough for me, but I think through my other extracurriculars, I've been able to overcome that. 107 00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:28.919 Jenny Duan: Yep, that makes a lot",
    " of sense, all right. Thank you so much for your time today I'm curious. I've loved learning about you, and it seems like you have really great interests that could be a good fit at Mit. I'm curious if you have any final questions before we wrap up this interview today. 108 00:27:30.063 --> 00:27:37.340 huda: Yeah. I was wondering if there were any traditions at Mit that you particularly loved, and that you really enjoyed. 109 00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Have you heard about hacking at Mit. 110 00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.320 huda: Beaver hacks. 111 00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:48.814 Jenny Duan: So mit students have this tradition where they really like 112 00:27:49.440 --> 00:28:10.844 Jenny Duan: breaking into buildings. I don't know if they do this still and climbing in the air ducts and finding like secret rooms. And Mit has these secret rooms all over campus people scale buildings to find them. People set up couches in them, and they're kind of hangout spots, and students will go late at night, and they call it hacking, so they'll go late at night, and they'll go 113 00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.439 Jenny Duan: climb buildings, they'll find they'll 114 00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:20.809 Jenny Duan: break into aerodox, and I don't know if I'm even supposed to be telling you this, but that was one of the highlights of my mit experience. For sure. 115 00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.659 huda: Yeah. Well, I'm excited to do hacking when I go to. If I get into mit. 116 00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.090 Jenny Duan: Thank you again. Have a great rest of your day. 117 00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.194 huda: Thank you, you too. 118 00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:35.031 Jenny Duan: Stay on the call. And okay, here's hacking. By the way. 119 00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.009 huda: Oh, wow! 120 00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.154 Jenny Duan: It's kind of cool. 121 00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:46.100 Jenny Duan: But okay, great job. Let's talk about that. How did it feel? 122 00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:52.749 h",
    "uda: I feel like I messed up at some parts, and I was really nervous about that. But yeah. 123 00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.890 Jenny Duan: Are you wearing? What is this? Are you wearing a Harvard sweatshirt. 124 00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.340 huda: No, it was. It's just Hilfiger. 125 00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.860 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, okay, cool. 126 00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.662 Jenny Duan: I would say. 127 00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:11.350 Jenny Duan: maybe don't wear this tomorrow. Maybe wear like a plain colored thing, because it's too or not tomorrow, but during your interview, because I think it's too 128 00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.950 Jenny Duan: close to Harvard, like age in the colors. 129 00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:21.050 Jenny Duan: I think so. I would try to change into something just like a neutral color. If you can. 130 00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:33.090 Jenny Duan: Anyways, I think you did a great job. So what were the moments that you thought? We can debrief it now? So what were the moments you thought were challenging, or that you felt stuck. 131 00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:40.766 huda: I think that the academic interest, I think I started talking about data science. But then and then, when you ask for like 132 00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:48.280 huda: like, what specific data question I'm really interested in. I kind of just like blocked on that one. I didn't really know how to answer it. 133 00:29:48.540 --> 00:30:11.651 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I was gonna say for that one. I would suggest, that one I think you can practice or like come up with an answer for. And then I think one thing that you should emphasize a little bit more in your responses is just like I think you can be a little bit more nerdy, or you can find some more technical jargon, especially maybe when talking with about AI or about data science, like, I think, 134 00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:40.030 Jenny Duan: A lot of your answers came across as really professional, which is like a good way to put it. But I think for",
    " this type of interview, especially for Mit. They want to see people who can really like Nerd out about something or like get really passionate, and then like, start talking on a tangent about something for a long time, and I think that you shouldn't be afraid to do that in an interview like I think an interview is a setting, where, if you feel really passionate about a topic, you can should be able to like, talk about it for a long time, and they should be able to see the passion like 135 00:30:40.190 --> 00:31:08.230 Jenny Duan: like, let me demonstrate to you like this would be an example of me talking in a normal tone and in a normal, like professional conversation that I might use for a job interview. But for an Mit interview I might go off this tangent because I'm really really excited about this topic, and I might talk a little bit faster. Maybe not this fast. But I might talk a little bit faster to indicate that I'm super excited about a topic, and that I have this like big intellectual curiosity. And that's different from this tone, which is more like straightforward and formal. 136 00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.649 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense in terms of like phone. 137 00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:29.939 Jenny Duan: So obviously, don't do your whole interview in the really fast talking tone, and don't talk too fast. But I do think they want to see like your character, like change, or like you really get excited about a topic because Mit is a school like for nerds. So you should be able to like get really excited about a nerdy thing. 138 00:31:30.739 --> 00:31:53.899 Jenny Duan: The other thing I was wondering is, I think, that in a lot of your responses or not in a lot. But I think towards the end you started saying like, how you know you're the president of this, and this I think that the focus shouldn't necessarily be on your role or your leadership title, but rather like, I think your leadership will come across when you talk about like what you organize. S",
    "o instead of saying like, and the president of 139 00:31:54.178 --> 00:32:02.519 Jenny Duan: film club, you can say, like, at school, I lead the film club this year. We did this, and they talk a little bit about it in a more like. 140 00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:03.780 Jenny Duan: I guess 141 00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:12.640 Jenny Duan: collaborative tone, instead of emphasizing your leadership like, I think your leadership will come out when you talk about what you do, so you don't have to say your titles. 142 00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:14.290 huda: Okay. 143 00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.149 Jenny Duan: But I think like it's still good to say like I found it empowering. AI. 144 00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.809 Jenny Duan: But I don't think you need to 145 00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:26.000 Jenny Duan: like overly emphasize your titles, because I think your leadership will come across naturally. 146 00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.969 Jenny Duan: Were there any other parts that you felt were a little bit sticky or hard for you. 147 00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.109 huda: Let me see. 148 00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:43.529 huda: I think I don't. Do you think I answer the favorite class question properly? 149 00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:56.219 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think so. I think that that makes sense to me. I think, like with the favorite class question, it's just an intellectual curiosity question. So as long as you keep up like the 150 00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:12.570 Jenny Duan: like curiosity and like intellectual interests that was good, and I liked how you I think I don't know if it was in response to this question, but at some point you connected it to what classes you were interested in taking at Mit, or what you were interested in learning at Mit. I thought that that was really good. 151 00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:18.129 huda: Yeah, I think that was the like the y. Why mit one. 152 00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:36.199 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I liked your response for Ymat a lot. I think that in terms of your biggest reg",
    "ret in high school, I think that exclusivity is, I think, maybe not what I would say, because I feel like it sounds more like a social challenge than like a high school challenge. 153 00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:43.420 Jenny Duan: So for that response. I don't know. Would you? Are there any other challenges that come to mind. 154 00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.398 huda: I wasn't sure how to respond to that one. 155 00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:58.255 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think maybe we can come up with like a new answer for that. 156 00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:19.319 Jenny Duan: I think that talking about your background is something that you didn't really mention as much as I thought you would have like saying, how like I think you can talk about how Mountain House doesn't have as many resources, and how you had to like search outside Mountain House to like learn these different things. And I also think you didn't mention J. Camp in this interview, but I think that you should talk about J. Camp at some point. 157 00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:19.860 huda: Here. 158 00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.090 huda: True. 159 00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 160 00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:32.830 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I think that for, like the challenge in high school, I would talk about like how Mountain House is a little bit rural and like how? There's not as many opportunities there. 161 00:34:37.529 --> 00:34:42.409 Jenny Duan: And then, were there any other things. 162 00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.820 huda: We're like the questions like 163 00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.670 huda: fine like, do you think they should be more like unique or. 164 00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:56.960 Jenny Duan: No, I think it was great. I loved your 1st question, especially. Yeah. 165 00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:15.587 huda: Okay? And my kind of like, like when when you 1st say, can like, introduce yourself. Do you think that was like a okay introduction or so. So I do say that, like I moved to all schools across 2 continents. Which",
    " led to inconsistent education. 166 00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:29.154 huda: I don't know. I don't think I got to like. I think I forgot to kind of like like elaborate on that, because I was gonna kind of segue into like. That's how I was like passionate about making education accessible. 167 00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.420 huda: But I don't know if you noticed that. 168 00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:42.959 Jenny Duan: I think that that definitely. I think that that came out. And I think that your passion there came out so I think that that was that was good. I don't have any thing to say about that. 169 00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.120 huda: Okay? And do I need to. 170 00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:54.350 huda: So wait. Okay, I still need to kind of work on my answer for like the specific data question that I'm interested in. 171 00:35:55.510 --> 00:36:00.540 huda: Because I feel like I don't really know if my responses like fit. 172 00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:09.624 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I guess you the data you talked about the like representation in media, right? But 173 00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:17.669 Jenny Duan: let's think, I mean, what questions do data scientists answer? 174 00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:49.910 Jenny Duan: maybe one thing that I mean when I think about this question, some things that come to mind are maybe the fact that like Chat Gpt is running out of training data and like, what are we going to do with generative AI models? If you want to talk about AI ethics you could talk about like sustainability and data centers like how they contribute to pollution, especially in places like Virginia, California, and how they challenge the Us. Power grid. That's 1 approach you can think about. 175 00:36:50.370 --> 00:37:05.520 Jenny Duan: You can also talk about privacy and surveillance like, in how personal data is collected and stored especially that you could reference the Tiktok ban that people have been talking about or like Facebook's data privacy, 176 00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:20.440 ",
    "Jenny Duan: like lawsuits and things like that. So I would try to. I would try to reference some like current developments that are happening either with like Chat Gpt, or maybe Facebook or Tiktok, just to show that you're on top of the news. 177 00:37:21.509 --> 00:37:23.309 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 178 00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.420 Jenny Duan: Any other questions. 179 00:37:27.248 --> 00:37:29.789 huda: No, I think, for now. 180 00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:39.959 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. I feel like you did really good. And you sounded very eloquent. So, yeah, I think congratulations. There, I feel like the biggest 181 00:37:41.160 --> 00:38:05.569 Jenny Duan: the biggest things I would say to change, or just in some of your answers, bring out that enthusiasm a bit more like I feel like you don't need to temper yourself with your responses. And then, second of all, just practice the specific questions that we talked about a little bit more like the data question the like, the what was the biggest challenge in high school question, and then, I think, be a little bit more 182 00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:22.519 Jenny Duan: like, don't really emphasize your well, do emphasize your leadership, but you don't need to talk about your titles or name. Drop the titles as much. Yeah, that sounds. I think everything should be good. Your interview should go from. It's about 30 min right? Did this? Is that the time range they gave you. 183 00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:29.900 huda: Let me check exactly, but I believe they said like, let me see. 184 00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.480 huda: Yeah, it's supposed to be from 9 to 9, 30. 185 00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.190 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. So yeah, it'll be like, 30 min. 186 00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:49.152 Jenny Duan: could be a little bit longer. But 187 00:38:49.990 --> 00:39:02.190 Jenny Duan: probably not gonna be too long. Yeah, okay, that sounds great. Good luck. How are you feeling? Was this helpful? Do you feel more prepared? Do you f",
    "eel more stressed like. 188 00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:14.380 huda: I think I feel a little more prepared. And also I was wondering if like, I can have like a list of things that I want to mention. Like I I kind of forgot about mentioning J. Camp, but I wanna. 189 00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.310 Jenny Duan: I think your extracurriculars list should just be the thing that. 190 00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.409 huda: Just like all of them. 191 00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:30.200 Jenny Duan: No, no, not all of it, but just like whatever comes up. But I think Jcamp synthoria empowering. AI should be like top of mind and folklift. But I think just Jcam synthoria and empowering AI, and then 192 00:39:30.445 --> 00:39:54.789 Jenny Duan: you can kind of weave other things in, and then also like don't be afraid to like, get a little bit more impersonal or personal, like can share some other things like that you do in your life that maybe aren't reflected, because the whole point is like they're trying to capture who you are outside of your college application, too. So like the things that you said about like helping your brother, like all those things that they might not know about you just by reading your application. I think you should work on emphasizing those as well. 193 00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:55.930 huda: Okay. 194 00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:01.709 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, well, good luck it's on, is it? On Friday or Saturday? 195 00:40:02.632 --> 00:40:04.020 huda: It's on Friday. 196 00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:10.400 Jenny Duan: Friday. Okay, let me know how it goes afterward. And yeah, good luck, and just be yourself. 197 00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.850 huda: Okay. Thank you. Bye. 198 00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:13.860 Jenny Duan: Bye."

So across 2 continents, and that meant a lot of changing curriculums and different learning platforms. So that kind of became a problem for me. But eventually I did settle down in Mountain House, California. 17 We're a small rural town in Norcal. 18 So not exactly part of the Bay Area, but still Norcal and I go to Mountain House High School, and I'm really involved in the Cs program and the media arts program.
