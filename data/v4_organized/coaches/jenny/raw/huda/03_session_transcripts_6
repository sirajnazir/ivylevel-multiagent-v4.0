How's it going? 2 00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.629 huda siraj: Good! How are you? 3 00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.389 Jenny Duan: I'm good. How's your week? 4 00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:59.869 huda siraj: It's been going good. We had the club fair this week. So I was able to like, get my club approved for that. And get our members in and everything. So yeah, oh, that's really good to hear. Awesome. 5 00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.310 Jenny Duan: Alright, let's just get started. So with your club being approved. Does that mean that 6 00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.189 huda siraj: your club is is to be approved. Or does that mean? It's like already approved for the fair? Yeah. They didn't let us know until like the day of the club fair. So 7 00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.600 huda siraj: yeah, we were approved. 8 00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.800 huda siraj: yesterday. So yeah. 9 00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.129 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think you're echoing a bit for me. 10 00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.370 huda siraj: Oh, 11 00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.990 Jenny Duan: wait! No, that's better now. Maybe it's just that one time. 12 00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.759 huda siraj: Okay, 13 00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.619 Jenny Duan: actually, you're still echoing a little bit. Is there something in your speaker settings you can check? Or is that? Is it? Just I think, is this better? 14 00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, that's better. 15 00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.540 huda siraj: Okay. 16 00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.929 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. So club is approved. Yay. 17 00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.510 Jenny Duan: and 18 00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.089 Jenny Duan: oh, right, that's good. How's everything going with school in general. Like, did the community college team ever respond to you? 19 00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:20.020 huda siraj: Yeah. So I was actually able to get into my account. And then. I signed up for this course, but I need my counselor to approve it, so I'll probably meet her 20 00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.560 huda siraj: like tomorrow, after school, or something to see if she could approve it. 21 00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.289 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's such a good! That's such a huge way. I'm so happy that we're able to get that figured out. 22 00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.520 Jenny Duan: And how are you planning to meet your counselor if they're not available for appointments? 23 00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:59.649 huda siraj: I think she's actually a lot more responsive like when you sign this one form like I don't know there was a form, but when I went in person I I found like a QR. Code to like this form and then the next day she like called me into her office. So I think I can reach out to her that way. 24 00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.309 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, sounds good. 25 00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.260 Jenny Duan: okay. 26 00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:18.999 Jenny Duan: so that's good. And then when you go meet with her, make sure that you like. Spend at least one to 5 min, introducing yourself and like, so she can get to know you. 27 00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.639 Jenny Duan: And 5 min 28 00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.229 Jenny Duan: introducing yourself and 29 00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.049 Jenny Duan: your interests. All these goals and then obviously sign the form 30 00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.220 Jenny Duan: quote. 31 00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.510 Jenny Duan: okay? And then SAT. Were you able to take a practice test this weekend? And how did that go. 32 00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.070 huda siraj: Yeah, the one that I took before the call. I think I got like a 1430. 33 00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.040 Jenny Duan: Oh, right right. And then you haven't taken one since 34 00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.319 Jenny Duan: that's good. You can keep studying for that. 35 00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:21.709 Jenny Duan: If you have time. I would suggest reviewing the the math cheat sheet that I gave you or doing Khan Academy practice problems. But that's if you have time, because I think that doing the practice test alone might not be enough. If you're only doing it once a week, so it might be good in between to do a couple of extra practice sessions on Khan Academy, or just reviewing all the concepts on the cheat sheets that I've sent you. So that's good. 36 00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.869 Jenny Duan: And then empowering a I what's your progress on that so far? 37 00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:50.500 huda siraj: Yeah. So I spoke with the other girl, and she decided she went to help with building the curriculum and maybe social media. I think we're trying to aim to find someone who's good at web development cause. Although, like I do, web development, I feel like it wouldn't be solid enough to build like an actual website. Like. 38 00:05:50.700 --> 00:06:01.810 huda siraj: I think, cause I have like a lot of projects with websites already. So I feel like if I find someone who can do it better than me. Then that would be like, great. So 39 00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:18.189 huda siraj: yeah. And we're trying to find like people younger than us, cause the people in our grade like at least the girls. I don't think they have an experience in web development, and also people like younger than you would be more willing to help. 40 00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.640 Jenny Duan: So what's your plan to find someone younger? 41 00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:37.370 huda siraj: So my partner, she's in like the Cs level, which is like for a grade younger than us. So I think, she said. She has someone in mind who who's like good at Cs, and might be able to help us. 42 00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.350 Jenny Duan: So she gonna ask them this week. Yeah. 43 00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Then, were you able to create the Instagram account 44 00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.000 Jenny Duan: or start developing curriculum yet? Or is that still in in the works? 45 00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.400 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. I'm just gonna copy that over to our goals for this session. 46 00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. 47 00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:11.109 Jenny Duan: and then do you have a a weekly meeting or a meeting scheduled with your partner yet? Yes, so we met 48 00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.910 huda siraj: yesterday 49 00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:30.690 huda siraj: or day before yesterday. On call. And also this partner. We decided we wanted to sign up for the Congressional App challenge. We're brainstorming like ideas on like our project and stuff. So we talked about both things. 50 00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:39.940 huda siraj: Why don't just make it for the Congressional App challenge instead of making a website? Why don't you just create an app. You don't have to do both. 51 00:07:40.790 --> 00:08:05.320 huda siraj: yeah. Maybe like, cause the kinda thing we wanna kinda go for is to impact our community like like locally. So our idea was doing like a wildfire tracker, and like air quality, since like the city that we live in, we have like wildfires pretty frequently. 52 00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:13.339 huda siraj: So yeah, I think that's what we're gonna do. But we're still kind of. 53 00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.409 Jenny Duan: That's something different. I see. That's really really cool. 54 00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:33.309 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you should definitely do that. cool. And then for the okay, so for empowering AI, then we're still gonna keep the website and the curriculum and everything. And the webfall tracker is gonna be something completely different. 55 00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.880 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Amazing. Have you ever developed an app before? 56 00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:45.290 huda siraj: No. But I think. The Congressional app challenge is like more of like a software kind of thing. So it could be anything 57 00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:52.750 Jenny Duan: okay. Awesome. That's super exciting. And when do you think you and your partner are gonna start working on that? 58 00:08:53.210 --> 00:09:13.900 huda siraj: We wanna try to like start like the basics of it? This month, like kind of working on it. It's due November fifteenth, I think. And so we have like a lot of times. We're we're gonna work on the basics this month, or like September and try to get like a basic website down 59 00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:26.509 huda siraj: with front end and stuff. And we're gonna try to use Apis like, make it accurate. But any additional features. And like Ui changes, we'll do that like before the due date. 60 00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.510 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. I'm just gonna add it to your tracker right now and 61 00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.710 Jenny Duan: and then. Do you know how competitive your region is? 62 00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.989 huda siraj: I don't think it's that competitive 63 00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:51.530 huda siraj: I'm not sure, like, exactly cause it doesn't have display, like how many people are applying. But I've never heard of anyone talking about it at our school. So 64 00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.990 Jenny Duan: okay, that's pretty good 65 00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.800 Ivy Mentors: quick question that how do we find like how competitive a school is? 66 00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:06.259 Jenny Duan: A school or a a do you like politician. 67 00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.589 Ivy Mentors: right? Or whatever. 68 00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.399 Jenny Duan: I would look at 69 00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:33.969 Jenny Duan: the area location of the school, and then what their results are. So if they have, if they are sending a lot of students to Ivs every year, then it's probably more competitive. And then also again, if you hear about a school a lot, there's like some schools that you just hear about, because it's so toxic, or it's so competitive that there's stories that people graduate. They tell them. So. Yeah, that's I guess how you know. 70 00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.679 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I do. Yeah. Sorry bar. 71 00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:57.739 Jenny Duan: There's advantages to both competitive and non-competitive schools, because if you go to a competitive school, then the advantage is, you might have you know, teachers who are more equipped to dealing with college admissions and mo more prepared for that. So that's a plus. But it's also more toxic with the students as very hard to stand out at a competitive school. So that's the weakness. And at a lower competitive school. 72 00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:10.189 Jenny Duan: The benefit is, it's easier to stand out and more resources. It's easier to get them if you're smarter. But the difficulty is you have to be more self disciplined with those resources. So there's pros and cons to both competitive and non-competitive schools. 73 00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.510 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think this information is clearly something that's very high value. I feel like, you know, one of the things 74 00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.090 Ivy Mentors: it's like, you know, where, like number one, you know what what kind of school is my school 75 00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:39.880 Ivy Mentors: number 2 is also. Where do I stand? Right among my kind of peers? Right? Like, I think that information is also important which I feel like, it's something that can be made available, or I don't know if it's available like I. That's one thing I miss, like. 76 00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:52.330 Ivy Mentors: you know, to this like, because this school is just like the whole competitive. It's something that you know like, especially like Asian parents are not used to like. We come from such cutthroat and competitive environments. 77 00:11:52.390 --> 00:12:03.150 Ivy Mentors: So I feel like one of the things why students are not in don't have a sense of urgency, or I'll not able to do things is mainly because they they're not aware of like, who's doing what. 78 00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:14.010 Ivy Mentors: So I'm just wondering, like, you know, just just a side note Jennifer, us also to discuss later. It's a very valuable information which can probably drive some positive behavior. And 79 00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.380 Ivy Mentors: in students. 80 00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.330 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah, hunter, does your school rank students? 81 00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.640 No? 82 00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:36.070 Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. Cause I think I mean, obviously, a rank is a way to know where you stand. But yeah, generally If you're only if you're in like the top 5%. You can usually make it to T twenties if you 83 00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:51.670 Jenny Duan: don't have a lot of additional like resources. Or if you don't have anything special, so that's usually like how it goes. Which is why, at a competitive school, it's a lot harder to get in that 5 top 5, 10%. Compared to non competitive schools. So 84 00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.790 Ivy Mentors: then, then, how? How? If a school does not have a ranking system. Then how does the admission officer? Basically. 85 00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.009 Ivy Mentors: No, like, you know, if you know, student is actually tired, 5% or not 86 00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:31.460 Jenny Duan: benchmark. But they compare your Gpa. In all of your ex test scores and activities to everyone, applying everyone else applying from your school and everyone who has applied in previous years. So they can benchmark you against people who they've accepted in the past and seeing like, okay, this person has maybe a higher Gpa. Than someone we admitted last year, or this person has a lower Gpa than what we usually admit, so they can benchmark you. They have data against everyone who's applying in your year, and everyone who's applied in previous years. 87 00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.840 Ivy Mentors: and that would be specific to your school. The comparison is specific to your school, not even your school district. It's your school. 88 00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:45.050 Jenny Duan: school district. They have data points, your school district area, etc. But usually it's just your school. 89 00:13:45.170 --> 00:14:13.269 Ivy Mentors: So I'm sure this data is available somewhere. Right? I think I would love to have some view on that data, because I don't know who the have you heard of this data like, can you ask someone in your school? I'm sure your school should be having data right? Like how many people have actually made it to this top 20 school. There's a there's a girl who made it to Stanford this year. I know that your school also sends people to like top school, and then it kind of just gives like the statistics on like 90 00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.570 huda siraj: how many students from our school got into these colleges? 91 00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:25.319 huda siraj: Actually, I was just researching and then one of the winners for the Co. Congressional app challenge was from my school in 2021. 92 00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:30.280 huda siraj: And I just searched her up, and I think she goes to Stanford now. 93 00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.240 Ivy Mentors: Okay. 94 00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:42.969 Ivy Mentors: okay, any. Sorry to interrupt here. I think this is like something that II feel like, it's part of the strategy as well. Right we can discuss later. Sorry to interrupt. I'll I'll go on mute. Sorry. 95 00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:54.539 Jenny Duan: Oh, who do you have has a lot of data in it. Wait, okay, at the end. Let's walk through your novis because there's a lot of things that you can learn just from like looking at naviance and looking at. I think you can. 96 00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.080 Jenny Duan: Are you able to see people's Gpas like what people's GPS? 97 00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.460 Jenny Duan: Okay? 98 00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.500 Jenny Duan: Okay? Cause I remember. 99 00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:12.430 Jenny Duan: there's something like that what I had in obvious. But I'm don't quite remember. We can take a look at that later, after we've finished talking about everything else. If we have time. Okay. 100 00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.509 Jenny Duan: so for forklift. How's that progress on that going? 101 00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:30.030 huda siraj: Yeah. So actually, I had a question. I was wondering if I could kind of shift it from. Muslim, owned businesses to Indian owned businesses. Cause I feel like 102 00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:39.650 huda siraj: the Muslim businesses they're kind of like. It's really niche. And the people that I've been messaging either like kinda ignore me, or 103 00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:52.420 huda siraj: just kind of put it off and then I feel like there's an abundance of Indian businesses. In my community. And there's like, actually people that would like to be interviewed. 104 00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.990 huda siraj: So I was like thinking that I could switch to that. 105 00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:03.529 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think, okay, are you able to secure at least one interview from a Muslim owned business? Because 106 00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:14.750 Jenny Duan: I think the reason why we want to target Muslim owned businesses is because usually in colleges, the Muslim community is more underrepresented than the Indian community, and 107 00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:30.619 Jenny Duan: portraying that as like a core. Identity of your background is more, I think, more compelling because colleges, obviously they want to increase like their diversity on all fronts, like religion, culture, etc., etc., etc. And I think, like 108 00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:51.440 Jenny Duan: portraying your Muslim background. First is a bit more compelling, just because usually there's less Muslim students applying to like specific colleges or like the communities are smaller. So I would try to still go for that. But obviously, if that's impossible, then we can pivot. But if you're able to just get at least one, I think that would be good for the start. 109 00:16:51.460 --> 00:17:13.150 Ivy Mentors: Sorry to interrupt again, like I would love for Hudar to really like walk like, you know, for further, like, you know, share with you. You know, like, what is the struggle that you're having with. I would love to understand that. I mean, we live in a neighborhood which has 500 Muslim families. Actually right? It's a big community here. So I'm also struggling to understand. So II just want to understand a bit more like what your problems are. 110 00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:33.190 huda siraj: Yeah, so basically, like there's like a lot of Muslim own businesses, and which I thought would be good but when I try reaching out to them, either they like they don't wanna like be known as like a small business, because they kinda like 111 00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:45.570 huda siraj: they're very flexible. So sometimes they'll like sell food or something, and then, like they'll just stop their business for some time, so they don't like put themselves out there. 112 00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.619 huda siraj: And then there's also like 113 00:17:48.640 --> 00:18:03.840 huda siraj: I messaged this brand the same email that I emailed, the Hannah person, and they do like decorations and stuff. And so I emailed them about it, and they just saw it and like ignored it. So I'm not really sure like 114 00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:14.899 huda siraj: they're not really like responsive to me, so I could find one. But like I think that's like the Max that I could probably find out of for most of my own businesses. 115 00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:23.519 Ivy Mentors: So so I think I think your your main barrier is like, so just to kind of reframe it. I mean, these are home based businesses, right? 116 00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:35.380 Ivy Mentors: So when you talk about like small business. Let's not like brick and mortar where they have like shops. And they're registered site. Right? That's the that's the challenge that I think, who guys highlighting a lot of these families do like, you know, home catering 117 00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:52.339 Ivy Mentors: or they kind of run like, you know. Like, you know, Indian kind of Asian, or like, you know, spices, and like, you know, they kind of import from that kind of stuff like that, you know, like happens in like Asian neighborhoods as well, I'm sure. So I think that's what you're saying. 118 00:18:52.520 --> 00:19:03.970 Ivy Mentors: But I don't necessarily think that they're not willing to connect. I mean you. You should probably try to. I don't know what. What's the thought on that, because some of these might not even be like 119 00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.900 Ivy Mentors: legally acceptable, like, you see, like 120 00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:13.349 Ivy Mentors: running like a catering service from home is probably not a not a legal thing. So yeah. 121 00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.730 Ivy Mentors: Ms. Warholm. 122 00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:25.390 Jenny Duan: right? That's kind of what I was thinking, too. Like they might not be, I guess, willing to be featured if they're kind of doing it under the table, or if they're only doing it small for, like their friends or family and things like that. 123 00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:35.829 Jenny Duan: What if you, instead of okay, how many like. Are there any brick and mortar businesses that you could highlight like places that are more established, that are trying to grow their business? 124 00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:48.509 huda siraj: So those were like my kind of like initial ones that I was gonna reach out to like the hen of business. I think they're actually willing to work with me and then there's, I think. 125 00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:54.350 huda siraj: my friend's mom sells clothing, so I think I might ask her 126 00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.429 huda siraj: But like there was like other options I had, but they're like 127 00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:06.690 huda siraj: leaving me on red and stuff, cause I messaged them on my messenger, and I saw it, and I gave them like 128 00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.670 huda siraj: 4 days, or like a week. And they still haven't replied. 129 00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.349 Jenny Duan: Have you sent a follow up yet? 130 00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.769 huda siraj: I think I can try. But yeah, I'll see if they reply to my follow up. 131 00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:29.139 Ivy Mentors: I mean but but I mean again, I think it's not a problem like, you know, for you. I mean you should leverage different connections right? I mean, like 132 00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:39.610 Ivy Mentors: I think you should leverage your your parents getting like in touch with a business again. Like III love the fact that you're trying 133 00:20:39.690 --> 00:21:03.880 Ivy Mentors: might be. There is something. It's it. I just don't think it's so hard. But the other thing I have is like, how important is the hyperlocation versus one of the challenges. Also, Jenny, is that we are in kind of a you know, slightly kind of, I would say out out of a highway kind of a community, right? So it takes like 10 min for us to go to like one of the kind of shopping lots as an example. 134 00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:15.590 Ivy Mentors: So we are not in a very crowded. It's a very secluded community. And that's why probably shops are not around. But I think the closest city would be like Dublin or Tracy. There are a few other Eastbay cities. 135 00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.710 Ivy Mentors: so how much is that acceptable? 136 00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:43.779 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that's fine, too. As long as you're able to commute and film it, I think any place is fine as long as you know, you're able to like, go and film and commute there. So maybe yeah, maybe one strategy that we can use. And I'm really, really happy about all the effort that you're putting into this. I know it's been difficult, but it seems like you're putting a ton of effort in which is really good to see. I think you should try, maybe 137 00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.889 Jenny Duan: expanding your scopes like to other cities like Dublin, Tracy, or places that are slightly further, but that you're still able to get to. What do you think about that? 138 00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:18.940 huda siraj: Yeah, I think that would definitely like open more options for me. Yeah. And I think, do you think it's a good idea? If there's like a Facebook page and I could leave like a post and talking about like my initiative, and like what I like to do. And if anyone else is interested, cause I feel like that could get people like interested. And 139 00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:19.870 huda siraj: yeah. 140 00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.359 Jenny Duan: oh, that's a really good idea. I love that. That's very creative. 141 00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:32.140 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you should definitely do that. And have you scheduled your first business interview yet with the Hannah Company. 142 00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:46.120 huda siraj: No, I'm still in the process of like messaging them. Cause. They wanted to go from email to messages. So like, I, message them like today, about like, oh, this is my number. 143 00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.900 huda siraj: like, would you like to set up a session. And yeah. 144 00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.639 Jenny Duan: oh, he sounds perfect. 145 00:22:51.810 --> 00:23:04.420 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think maybe a goal for this week would be to schedule that interview and then do the Facebook post and then reach out to 3 other businesses. They don't have to be in Mountain House. They can be, you know, other in other parts of the East Bay. 146 00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.280 Jenny Duan: Great. And then 147 00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.519 Jenny Duan: the next thing is the video game project. How's that going? 148 00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:26.530 huda siraj: Yeah. So I've been working on like more game art, and I think this time for the footage that I'm getting for, like the devlog I've kind of been emphasizing like 149 00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:50.100 huda siraj: so I'm making Ada Lovelace in the game. So I've been like emphasizing, like the game art and like the process of like finding famous women and stem, and like kind of their history and like, including the reason why I put them there like their character, and how like explaining how they're relevant in my game. 150 00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.680 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 151 00:23:53.190 --> 00:24:00.829 Jenny Duan: That is super super cool. Have you also been able to get your first post up yet or not? Yet 152 00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:09.689 huda siraj: I totally forgot about the social media. I think I'll I'll try to do that today. Actually, I could probably do it after this call. 153 00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:19.900 huda siraj: okay, great. And then it's just like a little introduction post like maybe something about you. And like, while you're working on this game and what you're doing 154 00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.889 Jenny Duan: working 155 00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.050 Jenny Duan: on the game. What are you doing? Alright. Okay. 156 00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.019 Jenny Duan: And then for the Youtube, how is your cross posting going? 157 00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:41.140 Jenny Duan: How's your side? Your your video logging and your footage for gamemark going? 158 00:24:41.420 --> 00:25:06.419 huda siraj: Yeah. So like, I said, kinda like trying to emphasize like the story behind the game rather than like just footage of me working on it. So I've been like collecting like I've been trying to like research more about the characters I'm adding in like Ada Lovelace, and how like the architecture and stuff. And I've been trying to like give it meaning. So in the video, I'm talking about 159 00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:14.140 huda siraj: like, I wanna add this character to represent the women and stem. And I, kinda yeah, I was trying to like. 160 00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:20.070 huda siraj: emphasize that. I'm doing this to encourage women and stuff. 161 00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:27.999 Jenny Duan: Awesome? And so how's your progress on the video? When do you think that will be able to be up? 162 00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.320 huda siraj: Probably by the end of the week. 163 00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.859 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So let me just put that in your goals. 164 00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.100 Jenny Duan: And 165 00:25:39.190 --> 00:26:00.890 Jenny Duan: by end of week, okay, amazing. So this is how we are on all of your goals right now. I just wanna take a moment to reflect on how far we've come since the beginning, because look at just all the progress that you've been making on all of your different extracurriculars that we basically only started a couple of weeks ago. So I feel like you should be very proud of. 166 00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:10.689 Jenny Duan: And then, before we move on, I want to see your navience. But do you have any other questions about the plan for this week or anything related to your passion projects. 167 00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:23.130 huda siraj: no, I think I think, for now I'm set also, actually, I wanted to talk about my film editing club. So 168 00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:34.310 huda siraj: we are limited to only meeting like once per month. And the rest we're gonna have to meet virtually. So. We're trying to do like as many projects as possible. 169 00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:42.969 huda siraj: And like, how? How? Many members you think we need to like, be considered like an effective club? 170 00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:50.080 Jenny Duan: I don't think there's a number of members. But usually when the club 171 00:26:50.230 --> 00:27:18.329 Jenny Duan: okay, I think you should try to get as many people to sign up as possible. So give incentives to sign up because you can count everyone who signs up as technically like a member. And that's what. And the number of sign ups and things you need concrete metrics to write down for like common app when they ask you for your club. So think during club fair or during the first week you should try to incentivize as many people to sign up as possible. And you can do that in many different ways. So I'm just gonna write this down. 172 00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:41.960 Jenny Duan: incentivize people to sign up like, do whatever you can to get people to sign up. You can pass out candy. You can give incentive and do like $25 gift card raffle, or something like that. So like something small, you know, it doesn't have to be big. But your goal should be to get as many people to sign up as possible, because that's like a metric that you need to write down on your college application. 173 00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:58.720 huda siraj: Does that make sense? Yeah, we so our club fair is like 2 days long. So the so during the first one we were able to get 70 members so far, and we're looking to try to like maybe increase that by 174 00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.140 huda siraj: like 50, maybe 175 00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:10.470 Jenny Duan: yeah, you know. Wr, give out Boba, like, do whatever you need to be able to sign up. Because 176 00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:28.480 Jenny Duan: yeah, once they're on that email list like, that's honestly, what's the most important. And then with the film club, what kind of activities are you planning for the film club like are you thinking about? You know, creating a short film. Are you thinking about having students enter like a documentary contest? Or what kinds of projects are you planning with the film club itself? 177 00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.339 huda siraj: So here are some things that we're gonna do. 178 00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:45.169 huda siraj: First, I think we're gonna work on the intro for student news. So that they get something that they get to have on the student news that they show every Thursday cause. And then we also want 179 00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.210 huda siraj: like a feature on 180 00:28:48.260 --> 00:29:03.370 huda siraj: on student news cause. A lot of people are just joining cause they cause everyone wants to be on student news. So what we're gonna do is collaborate with other clubs. And we're thinking of making this kind of like a fundraiser. 181 00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:21.979 huda siraj: So every club that wants like an advertisement has to pay us like 15, or $10 and then we could put it put it on mh, TV, like the news. And then that way, by the end of the year we'll have enough money to like, have club T-shirts and such. 182 00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:37.629 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's really awesome. Sounds good. And then let's think about doing something to like mark the longevity of a club, because you want to have people coming back every week for a reason. So what is going to be, in your opinion, the reason why they keep coming back to Film Club. 183 00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.290 I think. 184 00:29:40.330 --> 00:30:01.530 huda siraj: I think like the chance. So we have like in Film Club since we're making like short films and such. I think a lot of people are signed up to be like an actor or actress cause they like wanna, especially the Drama Club people. They wanna like have tangible projects that they can show when they're applying for acting school or for drama. 185 00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:28.930 huda siraj: And so I think that's like a majority of our members are honestly just actors and actresses. But yeah, I think also for our club fair. We had 2 giant camcorders out. So then a lot of people are interested by that. And then so we're also offering that if you join our club. We're looking for 3 officers. So if you wanna officer position, you should apply 186 00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.789 huda siraj: so yeah. 187 00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.240 Jenny Duan: gotcha sounds good. 188 00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.620 Jenny Duan: And 189 00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:56.430 Jenny Duan: so yeah, really exciting that you already have 70 members. That's that's pretty big. Yeah, especially if you're president. So yeah, congratulations. Now, I want to take a second to walk through your navience. I'm wondering if you can share your screen and we can look over some of the data you can find on audience. 190 00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.220 huda siraj: okay, 191 00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.710 huda siraj: Can you see my screen? 192 00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.989 Jenny Duan: Yes, I can. Okay. 193 00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.740 Jenny Duan: oh, interesting. This is different. Okay, maybe go to colleges. 194 00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.770 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then you can 195 00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.059 Jenny Duan: press advanced advance college search. 196 00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:21.890 Jenny Duan: Yes. 197 00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:30.660 Jenny Duan: and okay. Now let's look at let's just search up one school like search up Stanford, for example. 198 00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:40.789 Jenny Duan: have your counselors instructed you to do the quizzes on here like the the Naviance, like 199 00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:53.189 huda siraj: surveys or quizzes, or anything to match you on. No, but I remember last year they were showing like, I think the juniors are the sophomores or no, the juniors or the seniors how to make a resume. 200 00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.560 Jenny Duan: Bye. 201 00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.799 Jenny Duan: Click, yeah, click, Stanford, and then scroll down to the bottom. 202 00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.000 Jenny Duan: Okay. 203 00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.810 Jenny Duan: let's see how many students 204 00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.739 Jenny Duan: are applying. Okay, see? Yeah, this is what I mean. Okay, scroll up 205 00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.240 Jenny Duan: the how do you compare scroll down? 206 00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.370 Jenny Duan: Yes. Okay, this. 207 00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:40.400 Jenny Duan: This is very. This is this, data is gold. Look, because it tells you your high schools, middle 50% of accepted students and the national middle 50. So it looks like right now, your Gpa is low for Stanford compared to hasn't been updated. Maybe it hasn't been updated. 208 00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.580 Jenny Duan: Can you switch it from Gpa weighted to something different? 209 00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.479 Jenny Duan: Do you feel cumulative? Maybe. 210 00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.110 Jenny Duan: Is this your Gpa, would you say? Or 211 00:32:52.140 --> 00:33:02.829 huda siraj: I think it was like, yeah, like around. I think it was like 3 94. Something like that. What do you think is wrong with your Gpa. Waited. 212 00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:09.100 huda siraj: I don't think this is like linked to my actual grades. I think I probably updated this like 213 00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.970 huda siraj: freshman year or something. 214 00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.209 Jenny Duan: Okay? So it's not. It's not like, live linked. Okay. 215 00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.569 Jenny Duan: great go. Can you go back to Gpa weighted? 216 00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:26.590 Jenny Duan: So this tells you the benchmark that you need to be if you want to get into a school like Stanford, or you know whatever school that you want to apply for 217 00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:35.089 Jenny Duan: And do you see like? So we can look at other schools later. But you need to get at that. 218 00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:45.320 Jenny Duan: 38 th, 4.3 8 to 4.5 range at least. Now try to get to that upper range like 4.5 Gpa. so that means, like, maybe 219 00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:56.940 Jenny Duan: trying to take more. Ap's your senior year and doing other strategies to get your Gpa up. And then for the sat, you can see at the bottom it doesn't give you any school specific data. I don't think 220 00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:14.949 Jenny Duan: 1330. That's I think you should disregard that. That's too too low. But you can see the national 50% is 13 80 to to 1580, and you should try to get to that upper edge of the range. I think positioning yourself around the top 75 is always a good idea when you're applying for colleges. 221 00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:22.670 Jenny Duan: So you need it. That's why I'm saying that 50, 1550 to 1580 range. Because of that. And then if you scroll down a CT, 222 00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:28.960 Jenny Duan: you can see 32 to 35 is the range. Obviously you should try to aim for higher like 35. 223 00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.889 Jenny Duan: so 224 00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:38.040 Ivy Mentors: amazing, I've I've never seen. Okay, so this is only ex accessible to students right through school. 225 00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:47.250 Jenny Duan: through school, through navy, on specifically, which is why which is why II was very happy when I heard that who'da had it so I could walk her through how to use it 226 00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:58.160 Ivy Mentors: amazing, amazing. This is absolutely well, I think, also to really motivate and drive like, you know, when you put the the the chart like, you know. Why. 227 00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:09.990 Ivy Mentors: gpa, increasing Gpa and y increasing sat score is important telling like showing the why makes it easy right like then, to really put that rigor. And because then you know why you're doing this 228 00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.380 Ivy Mentors: so 229 00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:15.809 Jenny Duan: and this is Oh, yeah. Sorry to interrupt. Continue. Oh, please start. 230 00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:27.809 Jenny Duan: Oh, Huda, this is what you're talking about before. Right? Like this is, yeah. Your school's application history. 2023. Again, 36 people applied, 2 were accepted and one of them enrolled. 231 00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.500 Jenny Duan: and then in the previous 5 years there has been no one. So 232 00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.340 Jenny Duan: what does that tell them? Right like, you know what what I mean? 233 00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:46.329 Ivy Mentors: That's that's very interesting. So it's like. so it's just that people are not going from here. And then, like people who made it so like 2 people applied, and just one got into Stanford 234 00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.740 Ivy Mentors: is everyone. Remember. 235 00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:55.230 Jenny Duan: 36 people applied, 2 got in and one decided to go. Some one else decided, got in, decided to go somewhere else. 236 00:35:55.490 --> 00:36:00.290 Ivy Mentors: Amazing, amazing. So someone has actually changed the game. 237 00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:06.420 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think, what what does that mean? Actually right for like, what does that tell you? 238 00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.519 Ivy Mentors: looking at a school like this, now that 239 00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:21.180 Jenny Duan: you know, maybe you can try some other kind of Ivy League just to see? Oh, Berkeley, Berkeley is good. One. Yeah. Let's see, like, Berkeley, yeah, yeah. 2024, 2081 people are thinking about applying to Berkeley already. 240 00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.340 Jenny Duan: And 241 00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:31.600 Jenny Duan: and then 2023, 147 people applied. How big is your class? How big is? How many people are in a class? 242 00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.960 huda siraj: I think like 400, I think. 243 00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.750 Jenny Duan: Okay. So 244 00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.780 Jenny Duan: almost a threer. More than a third. Actually, students apply to Berkeley. 245 00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:46.999 Jenny Duan: Out of those, 10 are accepted and 5 enrolled last year. 246 00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.020 huda siraj: Wow. 247 00:36:49.710 --> 00:37:07.019 Ivy Mentors: wow, II mean, App, why would this information not be like available to parents? Like, I, yeah, anyway. So I mean that at least like it's, how, how does? How? How do you? How do you know that 20 or 24 like people are planning to apply like, how does the school know about it. 248 00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:22.539 Jenny Duan: because you indicated in naviance, because naviance is how your counselors do your like. Every counselor, has to send information to the school about you, and that's a why it's important to establish relationship with your counselor. But B, why, they use novian, so they can send information about you to the colleges 249 00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.129 Ivy Mentors: that you use to send information to colleges. Okay. 250 00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.079 Jenny Duan: look at this. This is gold. Look at this 251 00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:44.359 Jenny Duan: graph of Gpa. And sat with Berkeley. Acceptances. Look, accepted. Stat. 1540, G. 1,500, 58, 4.7 3. That's pretty high 252 00:37:44.420 --> 00:38:00.310 Jenny Duan: excepted, sat 1350 GPA. 4.7 5 7. But remember this, Berkeley doesn't look at your sat Berkeley, in all the Ucs. Are completely test blind, which means, even if you take a sat, they don't look at it. So that's why you could ignore all the things in the SAT. And just look at the GPA. 253 00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.020 Ivy Mentors: Okay, so this is for her school. Right? 254 00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.519 Jenny Duan: Just let's see. can you scroll up, please? 255 00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:16.530 Ivy Mentors: This is, I believe this is for yeah, ex applications for Mounthouse High School. Okay? So can you show me the the extreme right green tick. Like, I like, I want to see, like, who? Yeah. 256 00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.460 Jenny Duan: 4.7 3. So this is last year. Yeah. 257 00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.810 huda siraj: I don't know it 258 00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.130 huda siraj: none. Say. 259 00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.489 Jenny Duan: well, it's all over. 260 00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.450 Ivy Mentors: Sorry. 261 00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.649 Jenny Duan: I think it's all years. 262 00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:35.920 Ivy Mentors: Oh, it's all here, so that's kind of the person who's actually the highest kind of score, right? In terms of 263 00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:41.500 Ivy Mentors: that's kind of that's that's kind of your like, you know. The bar. The bar has been set. 264 00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:55.419 Ivy Mentors: They don't care about your sat. That doesn't matter to them, because they're all test blind. So it's only your Gpa. That matters. 265 00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:01.529 Ivy Mentors: And how do you boost your sorry for migrants? How do you now boost your kind of Gpa, the only way 266 00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.310 Jenny Duan: take more 267 00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:18.530 huda siraj: Ap. Is the only way out. Yeah, or dual enrollment does dual enrollment give you boosted Gpa, hooded? Yeah, I think so. But for dual enrollment, I think they they don't you have to sign up for that? Since, like freshman year, I think 268 00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.569 Jenny Duan: I see, okay. 269 00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.340 Ivy Mentors: amazing. 270 00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.330 Jenny Duan: Why don't we choose another school? We can look again. 271 00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:35.680 Ivy Mentors: Wow, amazing. So this piece of information is locked with the schools. But kids do have access. Students do have access. 272 00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.399 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's look. Ucla, 1, 40 applied 273 00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:47.549 Jenny Duan: 11 were accepted and 8 enrolled. Okay, that's pretty good. That means like a third of students applied to Berkeley and Ucla. 274 00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.399 Jenny Duan: And then, yeah. 275 00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:50.940 Jenny Duan: it. 276 00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.090 Ivy Mentors: you know. 277 00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.260 huda siraj: And he felt like weightlessly. 278 00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.679 Ivy Mentors: you know what I mean? Yeah. So 279 00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.529 Ivy Mentors: I mean, at least, Uc's looks. 280 00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:13.200 Ivy Mentors: And again, I think at 1 point like we'll have to really like, you know, strategize, and and be realistic and really like. Put all the effort in kind of the dream schools that are 281 00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.739 Ivy Mentors: like not really too out of reach. I mean, that's always good. But 282 00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:21.930 Ivy Mentors: like even to get into like these uses now is tremendously hard. So why not? 283 00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.400 Jenny Duan: Harvard? 16. A pod. One person accepted. 284 00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.689 Jenny Duan: They did not go. 285 00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:34.039 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. So I think, the history basic like. Only there's only been like one person like. 286 00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.429 Ivy Mentors: yes, some some person I want to know who that person is. 287 00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:52.569 Jenny Duan: That's the same person. Scroll down. I wanna see what the school statistics are. Can you go back to Harvard and go go see what the school statistics are in terms of their gpas and things. 288 00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.210 Jenny Duan: Click down, down, down. Yes, here 289 00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.959 Jenny Duan: this is the good information again that you should look at 290 00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.390 Jenny Duan: your high schools, accepted students and 291 00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:15.160 Ivy Mentors: So how do you see what's on the your school? What does that mean your school like that? AR this. Okay. Her school, like ranges in terms of Gpa. Is like 3.1 8 to 4.1. 292 00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:19.499 Jenny Duan: No, that's Howard acceptance. Gpa is okay. 293 00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:35.399 Jenny Duan: So that's that verbal. I think this data is wrong. But this should be the middle 50 of students who are accepted to Harvard what their Gpas are. But I'm pretty sure this is wrong, because obviously like, that's very low, I think. The girl that wait. 294 00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:45.259 huda siraj: Yeah. The girl that got into Stanford is the same one that got into Harvard as well. So I think. That 4.7 8 is probably her then. 295 00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.969 huda siraj: Yeah, but she's like class of 2023. 296 00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.349 huda siraj: I don't think that many people or I don't think it registered her, but she did get in 297 00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.149 Jenny Duan: are you sure she got it? 298 00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.480 huda siraj: Yeah, I remember she was like, 299 00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:14.579 huda siraj: like the Decca president and like and founder and basically she was like deciding if she wanted to go to Harvard or Stanford, so she's having a dilemma, so 300 00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.689 Jenny Duan: I don't. Then maybe just update yet. 301 00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.640 Jenny Duan: cool. But I'm going to Stanford. 302 00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:31.930 Ivy Mentors: But II think this is where II think Jenny, like you know in in in general, like, you know, I would love to understand, because I think there are a lot of students like HUD. Of course, I think we're talking about Hudaya, but also like 303 00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:40.480 Ivy Mentors: in a school like this, and I'm sure that plenty of schools, right? I would imagine the plenty of school that I think this is probably more common than the feeder schools, right? 304 00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:54.489 Ivy Mentors: Because that's gonna be only a few. How do you then really build a game plan? Right? You know, strategy around. For, like, you know, to your point, like. There are some certain benefits that a person like you know, school like this offers right from a strategy perspective. 305 00:42:54.660 --> 00:43:04.449 Ivy Mentors: right? Because she's not in the competitive school, and like she can really stand out so I would love to have that discussion and see like. 306 00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:17.689 Ivy Mentors: because when I looked at, look at this as a parent right like now, II absolutely have no clue about it. Right? So I'm looking at this the first time. So I'm feeling like, Wow, I made the biggest mistake of my life, you know, coming to the city right like putting Hood in a school where 307 00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:25.569 Ivy Mentors: there's probably like in in a decade. Only one person getting into like Stanford and Howard like that doesn't help me to value the school right? But 308 00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:31.509 Ivy Mentors: I think there is still hope or strategies like, that's what I wanna, I wanna see right? Why not? 309 00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:47.990 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah. I think with the with schools that don't have as many that aren't sending as many students. It's it's good. If you are a smart student like Huda, like cause you can stand out way more. And I think that comes from making an entire impression on your school like 310 00:43:47.990 --> 00:44:16.439 Jenny Duan: taking up leadership roles in your school, talking to your teachers, principals, etc. I think that's very, very important, because once people believe in you, they will start sending you opportunities, and they will make things possible for you. So that's a good. I think it's important to establish a reputation more as a leader within your school and doing whatever it takes. So like that student council that we were talking about meeting with your counselors, meeting with your teachers, meeting with your principals, and being very vocal about what your aspirations are to them, because then they will be able to help you get there. 311 00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:17.460 Jenny Duan: But 312 00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.609 Jenny Duan: again, it is very difficult. Yeah. 313 00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:29.650 Ivy Mentors: okay, so you're basically saying that this kind of a school like definitely a school recommendation and their support and endorsement is of critical value. 314 00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:39.020 Jenny Duan: and then obviously getting your Gpa up is the most important thing on, I think, honestly, for college admissions. 315 00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:42.409 Jenny Duan: passion project extracurriculars. They can only get you 316 00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:55.209 Jenny Duan: a little bit. But what gets you a lot is your foundation like I said your sat scored, your Gpa, that's the most important. So if you don't have a strong foundation, nothing else can help you. So I think that's why Whoa! It's like very important to 317 00:44:55.250 --> 00:45:10.049 Jenny Duan: take as many Ap's as you can, especially when we forecast for next year, putting as many aps as you can, but obviously that you're that you'll be able to excel in. You don't want to sign up for too many, and then get a bad Gpa. You want to sign up for as many as you can while maintaining high. Gpa. 318 00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.890 Jenny Duan: thank you. 319 00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Here's Brown. You can see 15 applied. One was accepted and one person enrolled. 320 00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.479 huda siraj: Oh, only 15 applied. It seems 321 00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:30.600 Ivy Mentors: not even like daring to apply like, I mean, you know, it's like, okay, I mean, so I it's it's sad. But you know. 322 00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.849 Jenny Duan: Let's see how many Christmas is so sad. 323 00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.810 Ivy Mentors: Same person. 324 00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.760 Jenny Duan: SAT. 1510 GPA. 4.6 they got denied. 325 00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.520 Jenny Duan: Was it the top? 326 00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:58.580 Jenny Duan: Someone has gone from the school. 327 00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:06.920 Ivy Mentors: they should have done something right like right apart from this course, of course, they might have been like very brilliant. But was it really awards? Was it like 328 00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.770 Ivy Mentors: I would love to understand? 329 00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:11.090 Ivy Mentors: Why do you sign up? 330 00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:32.450 Jenny Duan: You asked me earlier, like how college colleges know, even if they don't rank, how students are. This is how they know they have all this data, too, about all their applicants, and they can just compare like, it's very easy to be like, okay, this student has like the best Gpa and the best sat. And they do a bunch of activities. So obviously, we're gonna accept them compared to like somewhere out some another student on this 331 00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:44.380 Jenny Duan: list. So that's how the soon stands out. But obviously, if the student has a very impressive, extracurricular profile they have. If they're very ex excellent in some other field, they might accept them, even if they have a lower sat or Gpa compared to the top person. 332 00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.119 Jenny Duan: But schools have all the state as well. And that's how they make decisions, too. 333 00:46:48.630 --> 00:47:01.089 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think, really, this is the problem that I would love to solve right really like for students like for the who because of the you know, schools, and like not having that environment where they are able to really like. 334 00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:08.809 Ivy Mentors: really even aim for these schools, right? Let alone, like, you know, getting in like that, I mean to see, like only 15 people, even applying there to applying like 335 00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:20.710 Ivy Mentors: it's concerning to me. And and I think that is what probably is a is a is a thing to solve right for underserved. Of course I might be a bit biased, because, you know, I'm I'm who does, Dad. And I'm in this environment now. 336 00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:33.360 Ivy Mentors: But that will be very interesting, because you're saying it's still not impossible. But there, that is where I mean, someone has to bring that help right? That's what you are bringing for Huda. And 337 00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:45.370 Ivy Mentors: yeah, very interesting. really, like, you know, enabling really like, non-competitive and non-competitive public school students to get into top Ivs, you know, like, with that kind of help. 338 00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.009 Ivy Mentors: is the underserved one of the underserved segment segments. I would say, Yeah. 339 00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:54.340 Jenny Duan: yeah. For this one, I would just search California Institute of Technology. 340 00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.070 Jenny Duan: It the full name instead of Caltech. 341 00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:10.880 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, we are top of the hour. Jenny, I want to be respectful of your time. So thanks for that. 342 00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:16.139 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Who do. I would encourage you to just explore this on your own, and then think about 343 00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:29.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah, just think, just think about that. And Dopa, don't be stressed like, don't don't be stressed and don't like Cap yourself. That's what I tell, like everyone, don't give yourself a cap. Don't tell yourself. No. 344 00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.299 Jenny Duan: don't tell yourself like I'm not gonna apply to the school, because. 345 00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:53.409 Jenny Duan: whatever reason you don't want to be the one to reject yourself any. If anything, the call, let the colleges be the one to accept, reject, you, make their decision. But don't tell yourself that you can't do it because you are perfectly capable of aiming, however high you want to go, so don't let any of these statistics change your mental game, because that's the most important thing. 346 00:48:54.070 --> 00:49:19.019 Ivy Mentors: and and you also have a number of powers. You also have an advantage. I think that's what I want to understand, and I will try to bring that out. I think we should bring that out. That being in this kind of a school does not necessarily, like Elim, like, you know, completely shut the doors for you, because there is a trend setter, whoever did that re like respect and kudos to her or him. But I think is you're equally you have the opportunity now, right? You're working with a Stanford amazing 347 00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.949 Ivy Mentors: mentors. I think I want you to have that confidence as well. 348 00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:32.650 Ivy Mentors: So thanks Jenny. But II want to spend some time with all this particular platform. I wanna understand like, this is great news. Yeah, thank you. 349 00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.890 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Go ahead. Talk to you soon. Aye. 350 00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:41.830 Ivy Mentors: cool. Yeah, very helpful, Jenny. How are you doing? 351 00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:58.329 Ivy Mentors: I'm good. I'm been pretty busy. I know the resume. I know it's top of mind I'm I'm getting that to you like right now, but don't. Don't, Bob be bothered by my spams. I think you're already so supportive. It's fine, you know. So I just like, whenever you can. 352 00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.140 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, that's fine. But this is very interesting, I think. 353 00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:11.349 Ivy Mentors: I would love us to again. I need to spend some time. So what has happened now is like, I'm really heads down doing the same thing that I did with you in co-creating the college prep 354 00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:22.289 Ivy Mentors: today. I'm spending today and tomorrow with Erin to create the whole college app for her the mastery. Because she's brought a lead. Actually, that's a student from Canada. 355 00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:31.940 Ivy Mentors: So it's again an international event. Right? Yeah. So I mean again, like, I'm I'm very you know, I'm so thankful for the trust that you guys are putting on me right. 356 00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:57.049 Ivy Mentors: And II really want to deliver that back. So I've told her that transparently like, you know, we do 50 50. And then, just because she brought the lead as well, I'm gonna pay her 5 more lead incentive as well. So I want to motivate her. And she's all all in and trying to create that whole college app that's what. So yeah, don't worry about it, I think. Yeah, resume definitely. Send it to me. 357 00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:00.339 Ivy Mentors: Your product document. I will start 358 00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.299 Ivy Mentors: capturing a few things. 359 00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:11.480 Ivy Mentors: You know. Sorry for that kind of very ambiguous start, but I just wanted us to kind of brainstorm and find what is the outcome where you can contribute. 360 00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:22.300 Ivy Mentors: I think you have a knack for strategy and Ops as well. I think you're very strong operationally right? So I'm actually going to evaluate and see like how you can actually also help there. Because. 361 00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.320 Ivy Mentors: yeah, operational stuff is gonna be a critical part of the product. 362 00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:35.579 Ivy Mentors: And that's something. So strategy you you're absolutely strong. So strategies where the strategy is coming along quite well. By the way, now that we have all the kind of sales and stuff like that. 363 00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:46.170 Ivy Mentors: You know, I have a the designer coming up with a very clean and neat kind of a thing. I think 360 ss. Is our magnet use case. We bring on people on board with that, and then we can really sell 2, 3 things. 364 00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.209 Ivy Mentors: That's clear. 365 00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:54.669 Ivy Mentors: One thing I would definitely want, you know, to explore is also the Goto market. Right? 366 00:51:54.710 --> 00:52:00.560 Ivy Mentors: I don't know if I told you. But I'm actually working with you know, a Chinese influencer. 367 00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:16.470 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, she has like this in this platform called Billy Billy. Right? She has like 1 million followers. And she basically makes these videos actually for the international. So 368 00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:21.659 Ivy Mentors: I think she got accepted into yc, as well. so she's slightly busy now. 369 00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:31.879 Ivy Mentors: but I think what I wanted to discuss again, like, you know, because you're in China right now, and you do have an access to that network. And you were the one who initially said about Whatsapp and other things. 370 00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.379 Ivy Mentors: I mean, why don't you want to? I know that there are some barriers there, right? That China is actually cracking down on these kind of services. 371 00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:47.450 Ivy Mentors: But I would love to see if there's any opportunity like, you know, Jenny, you're already maxed out right like. So I'm not gonna give you like, Throw more stuff at you. 372 00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.460 Ivy Mentors: Let's think about creating new opportunities. Now, why not? Right? 373 00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.979 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah. 374 00:52:53.390 --> 00:53:05.440 Jenny Duan: I remember the way that my mom found my college counselor, like my contractor, who was not helpful. By the way is. He was doing like webinar series, like 2. We chat like he was 375 00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:13.829 Jenny Duan: targeting. He was not Chinese, but he was targeting wechat. And then I was like very effective, I think, cause my mom signed up, and I'm sure other people did, too. So 376 00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:22.429 Ivy Mentors: so why don't we kind of experiment that you know I would love to like, you know you kind of doing a webinar, and then bringing like just a 360 assess like, you know why not? 377 00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.999 Ivy Mentors: And I'm yeah. 378 00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:30.230 Ivy Mentors: I mean, or anyone else, right? It doesn't have to be. Or we could have a recorded kind of a session where we can. 379 00:53:30.300 --> 00:54:00.180 Jenny Duan: That's what I'm thinking, like one way that we can do leads. And I know my friend in Korea. She knows people who do. This, too, is like they they host a session. This is for parents. They do like 1 h session. They do a panel they bring in like 5 students, Stanford or Harvard, or whatever schools, 5 students. They do, a panel. They charge like $15, $20, $30 whatever X amount for admission to that panel, and then they they talk about the college application process in it on a high level 380 00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.829 and explain it to parents. 381 00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:14.659 Jenny Duan: That's one way we can target parents and also get new leads is do like a panel charge for entry. You can figure out however much you want to charge, it can be whatever. But then, just explaining the college application process. 382 00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:27.769 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. I think this really should be your go to market strategy. Okay, ours, like, honestly like, you know, Korea and the Asian market. If you could really strategize and tell what is a good strategy to get on board 383 00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:48.400 Ivy Mentors: and even if it means, like Nico kind of hiring someone there. Like, if you say, Okay, we probably should hire some local person who can be an agent who can probably, like, you know, do you be a salesperson? You know, there are a lot of sales and marketing teams today, actually, who ping you in Linkedin, who say that we can help you grow your business in Apac. We can help you grow your business in Mia Middle East and Africa. 384 00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:57.369 Ivy Mentors: But I wanted to take that ownership, and what I wanted to discuss with you is really a go to market engagement. So you help really crack that model enable me. 385 00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.620 Ivy Mentors: and whatever we sell, we can have a revenue share on that. Why not? 386 00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:17.849 Ivy Mentors: Why, why should I be like relying? See, I was trying to rely on, you know. Actually, I was working with a Stanford research student from China, who came to Oxford. I don't know if I told you she's worked in one of the biggest counseling services in China for 3 years. 387 00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:25.220 Ivy Mentors: Okay, as a counselor, and she wanted me. She connected me to that Chinese kind of crimson. 388 00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:34.479 Ivy Mentors: So I was actually even exploring a go-to-market partnership with a third party kind of direct engagement, like, you know, hey? I know that you have all these services. 389 00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:45.719 Ivy Mentors: And you what they need is actually students, right? And I'm like, okay, I can be that kind of point of contact. And you give me all the students, and we can work on that F short model. Why do I do that if I can directly do it like through? 390 00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:48.490 Ivy Mentors: You know, you or any other contact? Right? So 391 00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:57.479 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think I think I'm I'm just throwing it up, because, you know, like Edin from nowhere, she like again said, Oh, I have a Canadian student. And 392 00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:08.929 Ivy Mentors: I said, how did you come to know about it? Oh, they're like, through some of my family friends network, you know. And she wanted to get some help. And I said, Hey, you know what? Actually, you know. Come and join ib mentors. So I'm like, Okay, why not? 393 00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:17.790 Ivy Mentors: Great? Okay? Sorry. I'm taking your time. So send me that. Cv, I want to get started. I think the other one you saw that? 394 00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:23.670 Ivy Mentors: while you're still in Beijing, you know. Honestly, if there's a possibility. Oh, you're not in Beijing. Okay. 395 00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:47.960 Ivy Mentors: But why do you can take up a call right like I can ask him like, Hey, if some director is available, like, you know, let him let him talk to you know. What he told me is that, regardless of wherever you want to work like? He looked at your profile, and then immediately said, Does she know, mandarin? I said, yes, she knows, and then he's like it would be so easy for her in a company like tick tock to just like climb up the ladder right? Like language is such a such an important asset. 396 00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:50.829 Ivy Mentors: So you see, like I, you didn't even tell me. But 397 00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:56.040 Ivy Mentors: let me. Yeah, let me talk to someone. II will do anything. Basically. 398 00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:02.359 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I know that, you know. If you get Google, then you can always ditch Tiktok. I would tell you to go to Google. But why not? You know? 399 00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.480 Jenny Duan: Alright, totally 400 00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:11.320 Ivy Mentors: okay. I'm looking forward. Okay. So by the way, 2 things. Minkio, I don't know if I've said, but that's gonna be on Saturday. 401 00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:17.690 Jenny Duan: See? Neema still hasn't paid, you see, like this is the whole challenge it's not in. But Anrushka did book 402 00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.840 Ivy Mentors: for Monday. 403 00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:25.270 Ivy Mentors: and I told Nelma, you know it's fine, you know. Just pay like before, like last time. Hoop! 404 00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:30.879 Ivy Mentors: But you know, closing, closing the last mile is not easy, especially, you know, these are big packages, right? 405 00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.120 Ivy Mentors: So 406 00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:39.599 Ivy Mentors: right well she has to pay for the session. Otherwise, you know, there's no session. So, but at least she has a 407 00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:53.770 Ivy Mentors: track record, right? She has a history that not like Shashi, right, who has a track record of just squeezing like free. You see now why I did not send you a video. You might have thought, why is he not sending it? I knew this guy was a freebie right? He was trying to squeeze and extract. 408 00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:59.000 Ivy Mentors: and I sent him that proposal of $1,800. That's it. The guy has not shown up 409 00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.930 Ivy Mentors: like he's completely vanished. 410 00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:07.420 Ivy Mentors: Right? So yeah, I mean, but that's up to me, I mean, don't worry about it. Yeah, awesome 411 00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:27.650 Ivy Mentors: cool. So I just wanted to set like, go to market. I think I'm gonna focus on that because I feel like you're already maxed out. And but I think there is opportunity for you to, you know, because you've been such an integral part of really co-creating this, you're helping me on the Pm. Side, and like I can really enable more like, you know. Why? Why should I not talk about that, you know. 412 00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:35.480 Ivy Mentors: So yeah, help me out, you know. Let let me know, like you know, what? What's a good channel and way, and talk to your mom and talk to your friends? 413 00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.390 Ivy Mentors: You know, either in China or even like Korea, as an example like I'm more than happy. 414 00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.789 Jenny Duan: Sounds good. Thanks. Send me the Cv. Bye.",

How's it going? 2 00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.629 huda siraj: Good! How are you? 3 00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.389 Jenny Duan: I'm good. How's your week? 4 00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:59.869 huda siraj: It's been going good. We had the club fair this week. So I was able to like, get my club approved for that. And get our members in and everything. So yeah, oh, that's really good to hear. Awesome. 5 00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.310 Jenny Duan: Alright, let's just get started. So with your club being approved. Does that mean that 6 00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.189 huda siraj: your club is is to be approved. Or does that mean? It's like already approved for the fair? Yeah. They didn't let us know until like the day of the club fair. So 7 00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.600 huda siraj: yeah, we were approved. 8 00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.800 huda siraj: yesterday. So yeah. 9 00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.129 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think you're echoing a bit for me. 10 00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.370 huda siraj: Oh, 11 00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.990 Jenny Duan: wait! No, that's better now. Maybe it's just that one time. 12 00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.759 huda siraj: Okay, 13 00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.619 Jenny Duan: actually, you're still echoing a little bit. Is there something in your speaker settings you can check? Or is that? Is it? Just I think, is this better? 14 00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, that's better. 15 00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.540 huda siraj: Okay. 16 00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.929 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. So club is approved. Yay. 17 00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.510 Jenny Duan: and 18 00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.089 Jenny Duan: oh, right, that's good. How's everything going with school in general. Like, did the community college team ever respond to you? 19 00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:20.020 huda siraj: Yeah. So I was actually able to get int",
    "o my account. And then. I signed up for this course, but I need my counselor to approve it, so I'll probably meet her 20 00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.560 huda siraj: like tomorrow, after school, or something to see if she could approve it. 21 00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.289 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's such a good! That's such a huge way. I'm so happy that we're able to get that figured out. 22 00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.520 Jenny Duan: And how are you planning to meet your counselor if they're not available for appointments? 23 00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:59.649 huda siraj: I think she's actually a lot more responsive like when you sign this one form like I don't know there was a form, but when I went in person I I found like a QR. Code to like this form and then the next day she like called me into her office. So I think I can reach out to her that way. 24 00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.309 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, sounds good. 25 00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.260 Jenny Duan: okay. 26 00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:18.999 Jenny Duan: so that's good. And then when you go meet with her, make sure that you like. Spend at least one to 5 min, introducing yourself and like, so she can get to know you. 27 00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.639 Jenny Duan: And 5 min 28 00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.229 Jenny Duan: introducing yourself and 29 00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.049 Jenny Duan: your interests. All these goals and then obviously sign the form 30 00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.220 Jenny Duan: quote. 31 00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.510 Jenny Duan: okay? And then SAT. Were you able to take a practice test this weekend? And how did that go. 32 00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.070 huda siraj: Yeah, the one that I took before the call. I think I got like a 1430. 33 00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.040 Jenny Duan: Oh, right right. And then you haven't taken one since 34 00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.319 Jenny Duan: that's good. You can keep studying for that. 35 00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:21.709 Jenny Duan: If you have time. I would suggest reviewing th",
    "e the math cheat sheet that I gave you or doing Khan Academy practice problems. But that's if you have time, because I think that doing the practice test alone might not be enough. If you're only doing it once a week, so it might be good in between to do a couple of extra practice sessions on Khan Academy, or just reviewing all the concepts on the cheat sheets that I've sent you. So that's good. 36 00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.869 Jenny Duan: And then empowering a I what's your progress on that so far? 37 00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:50.500 huda siraj: Yeah. So I spoke with the other girl, and she decided she went to help with building the curriculum and maybe social media. I think we're trying to aim to find someone who's good at web development cause. Although, like I do, web development, I feel like it wouldn't be solid enough to build like an actual website. Like. 38 00:05:50.700 --> 00:06:01.810 huda siraj: I think, cause I have like a lot of projects with websites already. So I feel like if I find someone who can do it better than me. Then that would be like, great. So 39 00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:18.189 huda siraj: yeah. And we're trying to find like people younger than us, cause the people in our grade like at least the girls. I don't think they have an experience in web development, and also people like younger than you would be more willing to help. 40 00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.640 Jenny Duan: So what's your plan to find someone younger? 41 00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:37.370 huda siraj: So my partner, she's in like the Cs level, which is like for a grade younger than us. So I think, she said. She has someone in mind who who's like good at Cs, and might be able to help us. 42 00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.350 Jenny Duan: So she gonna ask them this week. Yeah. 43 00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Then, were you able to create the Instagram account 44 00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.000 Jenny Duan: or start developing curriculum yet? Or is that still in in the wo",
    "rks? 45 00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.400 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. I'm just gonna copy that over to our goals for this session. 46 00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. 47 00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:11.109 Jenny Duan: and then do you have a a weekly meeting or a meeting scheduled with your partner yet? Yes, so we met 48 00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.910 huda siraj: yesterday 49 00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:30.690 huda siraj: or day before yesterday. On call. And also this partner. We decided we wanted to sign up for the Congressional App challenge. We're brainstorming like ideas on like our project and stuff. So we talked about both things. 50 00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:39.940 huda siraj: Why don't just make it for the Congressional App challenge instead of making a website? Why don't you just create an app. You don't have to do both. 51 00:07:40.790 --> 00:08:05.320 huda siraj: yeah. Maybe like, cause the kinda thing we wanna kinda go for is to impact our community like like locally. So our idea was doing like a wildfire tracker, and like air quality, since like the city that we live in, we have like wildfires pretty frequently. 52 00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:13.339 huda siraj: So yeah, I think that's what we're gonna do. But we're still kind of. 53 00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.409 Jenny Duan: That's something different. I see. That's really really cool. 54 00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:33.309 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you should definitely do that. cool. And then for the okay, so for empowering AI, then we're still gonna keep the website and the curriculum and everything. And the webfall tracker is gonna be something completely different. 55 00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.880 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Amazing. Have you ever developed an app before? 56 00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:45.290 huda siraj: No. But I think. The Congressional app challenge is like more of like a software kind of thing. So it could be anything 57 00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:52.750 Jenny Duan: okay. Awesome. That's super exciting. And when do y",
    "ou think you and your partner are gonna start working on that? 58 00:08:53.210 --> 00:09:13.900 huda siraj: We wanna try to like start like the basics of it? This month, like kind of working on it. It's due November fifteenth, I think. And so we have like a lot of times. We're we're gonna work on the basics this month, or like September and try to get like a basic website down 59 00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:26.509 huda siraj: with front end and stuff. And we're gonna try to use Apis like, make it accurate. But any additional features. And like Ui changes, we'll do that like before the due date. 60 00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.510 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. I'm just gonna add it to your tracker right now and 61 00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.710 Jenny Duan: and then. Do you know how competitive your region is? 62 00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.989 huda siraj: I don't think it's that competitive 63 00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:51.530 huda siraj: I'm not sure, like, exactly cause it doesn't have display, like how many people are applying. But I've never heard of anyone talking about it at our school. So 64 00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.990 Jenny Duan: okay, that's pretty good 65 00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.800 Ivy Mentors: quick question that how do we find like how competitive a school is? 66 00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:06.259 Jenny Duan: A school or a a do you like politician. 67 00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.589 Ivy Mentors: right? Or whatever. 68 00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.399 Jenny Duan: I would look at 69 00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:33.969 Jenny Duan: the area location of the school, and then what their results are. So if they have, if they are sending a lot of students to Ivs every year, then it's probably more competitive. And then also again, if you hear about a school a lot, there's like some schools that you just hear about, because it's so toxic, or it's so competitive that there's stories that people graduate. They tell them. So. Yeah, that's I guess how you know. 70 00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.679 Ivy",
    " Mentors: Yeah, I do. Yeah. Sorry bar. 71 00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:57.739 Jenny Duan: There's advantages to both competitive and non-competitive schools, because if you go to a competitive school, then the advantage is, you might have you know, teachers who are more equipped to dealing with college admissions and mo more prepared for that. So that's a plus. But it's also more toxic with the students as very hard to stand out at a competitive school. So that's the weakness. And at a lower competitive school. 72 00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:10.189 Jenny Duan: The benefit is, it's easier to stand out and more resources. It's easier to get them if you're smarter. But the difficulty is you have to be more self disciplined with those resources. So there's pros and cons to both competitive and non-competitive schools. 73 00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.510 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think this information is clearly something that's very high value. I feel like, you know, one of the things 74 00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.090 Ivy Mentors: it's like, you know, where, like number one, you know what what kind of school is my school 75 00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:39.880 Ivy Mentors: number 2 is also. Where do I stand? Right among my kind of peers? Right? Like, I think that information is also important which I feel like, it's something that can be made available, or I don't know if it's available like I. That's one thing I miss, like. 76 00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:52.330 Ivy Mentors: you know, to this like, because this school is just like the whole competitive. It's something that you know like, especially like Asian parents are not used to like. We come from such cutthroat and competitive environments. 77 00:11:52.390 --> 00:12:03.150 Ivy Mentors: So I feel like one of the things why students are not in don't have a sense of urgency, or I'll not able to do things is mainly because they they're not aware of like, who's doing what. 78 00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:14.010 Ivy Mentors: So I'm just wondering, like, you",
    " know, just just a side note Jennifer, us also to discuss later. It's a very valuable information which can probably drive some positive behavior. And 79 00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.380 Ivy Mentors: in students. 80 00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.330 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah, hunter, does your school rank students? 81 00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.640 No? 82 00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:36.070 Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. Cause I think I mean, obviously, a rank is a way to know where you stand. But yeah, generally If you're only if you're in like the top 5%. You can usually make it to T twenties if you 83 00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:51.670 Jenny Duan: don't have a lot of additional like resources. Or if you don't have anything special, so that's usually like how it goes. Which is why, at a competitive school, it's a lot harder to get in that 5 top 5, 10%. Compared to non competitive schools. So 84 00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.790 Ivy Mentors: then, then, how? How? If a school does not have a ranking system. Then how does the admission officer? Basically. 85 00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.009 Ivy Mentors: No, like, you know, if you know, student is actually tired, 5% or not 86 00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:31.460 Jenny Duan: benchmark. But they compare your Gpa. In all of your ex test scores and activities to everyone, applying everyone else applying from your school and everyone who has applied in previous years. So they can benchmark you against people who they've accepted in the past and seeing like, okay, this person has maybe a higher Gpa. Than someone we admitted last year, or this person has a lower Gpa than what we usually admit, so they can benchmark you. They have data against everyone who's applying in your year, and everyone who's applied in previous years. 87 00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.840 Ivy Mentors: and that would be specific to your school. The comparison is specific to your school, not even your school district. It's your school. 88 00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:45.050 Jenny Duan: school district. Th",
    "ey have data points, your school district area, etc. But usually it's just your school. 89 00:13:45.170 --> 00:14:13.269 Ivy Mentors: So I'm sure this data is available somewhere. Right? I think I would love to have some view on that data, because I don't know who the have you heard of this data like, can you ask someone in your school? I'm sure your school should be having data right? Like how many people have actually made it to this top 20 school. There's a there's a girl who made it to Stanford this year. I know that your school also sends people to like top school, and then it kind of just gives like the statistics on like 90 00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.570 huda siraj: how many students from our school got into these colleges? 91 00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:25.319 huda siraj: Actually, I was just researching and then one of the winners for the Co. Congressional app challenge was from my school in 2021. 92 00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:30.280 huda siraj: And I just searched her up, and I think she goes to Stanford now. 93 00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.240 Ivy Mentors: Okay. 94 00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:42.969 Ivy Mentors: okay, any. Sorry to interrupt here. I think this is like something that II feel like, it's part of the strategy as well. Right we can discuss later. Sorry to interrupt. I'll I'll go on mute. Sorry. 95 00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:54.539 Jenny Duan: Oh, who do you have has a lot of data in it. Wait, okay, at the end. Let's walk through your novis because there's a lot of things that you can learn just from like looking at naviance and looking at. I think you can. 96 00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.080 Jenny Duan: Are you able to see people's Gpas like what people's GPS? 97 00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.460 Jenny Duan: Okay? 98 00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.500 Jenny Duan: Okay? Cause I remember. 99 00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:12.430 Jenny Duan: there's something like that what I had in obvious. But I'm don't quite remember. We can take a look at that later, after we've finished talking abou",
    "t everything else. If we have time. Okay. 100 00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.509 Jenny Duan: so for forklift. How's that progress on that going? 101 00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:30.030 huda siraj: Yeah. So actually, I had a question. I was wondering if I could kind of shift it from. Muslim, owned businesses to Indian owned businesses. Cause I feel like 102 00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:39.650 huda siraj: the Muslim businesses they're kind of like. It's really niche. And the people that I've been messaging either like kinda ignore me, or 103 00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:52.420 huda siraj: just kind of put it off and then I feel like there's an abundance of Indian businesses. In my community. And there's like, actually people that would like to be interviewed. 104 00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.990 huda siraj: So I was like thinking that I could switch to that. 105 00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:03.529 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think, okay, are you able to secure at least one interview from a Muslim owned business? Because 106 00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:14.750 Jenny Duan: I think the reason why we want to target Muslim owned businesses is because usually in colleges, the Muslim community is more underrepresented than the Indian community, and 107 00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:30.619 Jenny Duan: portraying that as like a core. Identity of your background is more, I think, more compelling because colleges, obviously they want to increase like their diversity on all fronts, like religion, culture, etc., etc., etc. And I think, like 108 00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:51.440 Jenny Duan: portraying your Muslim background. First is a bit more compelling, just because usually there's less Muslim students applying to like specific colleges or like the communities are smaller. So I would try to still go for that. But obviously, if that's impossible, then we can pivot. But if you're able to just get at least one, I think that would be good for the start. 109 00:16:51.460 --> 00:17:13.150 Ivy Mentors: Sorry to interrupt again, like I would ",
    "love for Hudar to really like walk like, you know, for further, like, you know, share with you. You know, like, what is the struggle that you're having with. I would love to understand that. I mean, we live in a neighborhood which has 500 Muslim families. Actually right? It's a big community here. So I'm also struggling to understand. So II just want to understand a bit more like what your problems are. 110 00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:33.190 huda siraj: Yeah, so basically, like there's like a lot of Muslim own businesses, and which I thought would be good but when I try reaching out to them, either they like they don't wanna like be known as like a small business, because they kinda like 111 00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:45.570 huda siraj: they're very flexible. So sometimes they'll like sell food or something, and then, like they'll just stop their business for some time, so they don't like put themselves out there. 112 00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.619 huda siraj: And then there's also like 113 00:17:48.640 --> 00:18:03.840 huda siraj: I messaged this brand the same email that I emailed, the Hannah person, and they do like decorations and stuff. And so I emailed them about it, and they just saw it and like ignored it. So I'm not really sure like 114 00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:14.899 huda siraj: they're not really like responsive to me, so I could find one. But like I think that's like the Max that I could probably find out of for most of my own businesses. 115 00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:23.519 Ivy Mentors: So so I think I think your your main barrier is like, so just to kind of reframe it. I mean, these are home based businesses, right? 116 00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:35.380 Ivy Mentors: So when you talk about like small business. Let's not like brick and mortar where they have like shops. And they're registered site. Right? That's the that's the challenge that I think, who guys highlighting a lot of these families do like, you know, home catering 117 00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:52.339 Ivy Mentors",
    ": or they kind of run like, you know. Like, you know, Indian kind of Asian, or like, you know, spices, and like, you know, they kind of import from that kind of stuff like that, you know, like happens in like Asian neighborhoods as well, I'm sure. So I think that's what you're saying. 118 00:18:52.520 --> 00:19:03.970 Ivy Mentors: But I don't necessarily think that they're not willing to connect. I mean you. You should probably try to. I don't know what. What's the thought on that, because some of these might not even be like 119 00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.900 Ivy Mentors: legally acceptable, like, you see, like 120 00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:13.349 Ivy Mentors: running like a catering service from home is probably not a not a legal thing. So yeah. 121 00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.730 Ivy Mentors: Ms. Warholm. 122 00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:25.390 Jenny Duan: right? That's kind of what I was thinking, too. Like they might not be, I guess, willing to be featured if they're kind of doing it under the table, or if they're only doing it small for, like their friends or family and things like that. 123 00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:35.829 Jenny Duan: What if you, instead of okay, how many like. Are there any brick and mortar businesses that you could highlight like places that are more established, that are trying to grow their business? 124 00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:48.509 huda siraj: So those were like my kind of like initial ones that I was gonna reach out to like the hen of business. I think they're actually willing to work with me and then there's, I think. 125 00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:54.350 huda siraj: my friend's mom sells clothing, so I think I might ask her 126 00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.429 huda siraj: But like there was like other options I had, but they're like 127 00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:06.690 huda siraj: leaving me on red and stuff, cause I messaged them on my messenger, and I saw it, and I gave them like 128 00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.670 huda siraj: 4 days, or like a week. And th",
    "ey still haven't replied. 129 00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.349 Jenny Duan: Have you sent a follow up yet? 130 00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.769 huda siraj: I think I can try. But yeah, I'll see if they reply to my follow up. 131 00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:29.139 Ivy Mentors: I mean but but I mean again, I think it's not a problem like, you know, for you. I mean you should leverage different connections right? I mean, like 132 00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:39.610 Ivy Mentors: I think you should leverage your your parents getting like in touch with a business again. Like III love the fact that you're trying 133 00:20:39.690 --> 00:21:03.880 Ivy Mentors: might be. There is something. It's it. I just don't think it's so hard. But the other thing I have is like, how important is the hyperlocation versus one of the challenges. Also, Jenny, is that we are in kind of a you know, slightly kind of, I would say out out of a highway kind of a community, right? So it takes like 10 min for us to go to like one of the kind of shopping lots as an example. 134 00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:15.590 Ivy Mentors: So we are not in a very crowded. It's a very secluded community. And that's why probably shops are not around. But I think the closest city would be like Dublin or Tracy. There are a few other Eastbay cities. 135 00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.710 Ivy Mentors: so how much is that acceptable? 136 00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:43.779 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that's fine, too. As long as you're able to commute and film it, I think any place is fine as long as you know, you're able to like, go and film and commute there. So maybe yeah, maybe one strategy that we can use. And I'm really, really happy about all the effort that you're putting into this. I know it's been difficult, but it seems like you're putting a ton of effort in which is really good to see. I think you should try, maybe 137 00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.889 Jenny Duan: expanding your scopes like to other cities like Dublin, Tracy, or places that are",
    " slightly further, but that you're still able to get to. What do you think about that? 138 00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:18.940 huda siraj: Yeah, I think that would definitely like open more options for me. Yeah. And I think, do you think it's a good idea? If there's like a Facebook page and I could leave like a post and talking about like my initiative, and like what I like to do. And if anyone else is interested, cause I feel like that could get people like interested. And 139 00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:19.870 huda siraj: yeah. 140 00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.359 Jenny Duan: oh, that's a really good idea. I love that. That's very creative. 141 00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:32.140 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you should definitely do that. And have you scheduled your first business interview yet with the Hannah Company. 142 00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:46.120 huda siraj: No, I'm still in the process of like messaging them. Cause. They wanted to go from email to messages. So like, I, message them like today, about like, oh, this is my number. 143 00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.900 huda siraj: like, would you like to set up a session. And yeah. 144 00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.639 Jenny Duan: oh, he sounds perfect. 145 00:22:51.810 --> 00:23:04.420 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think maybe a goal for this week would be to schedule that interview and then do the Facebook post and then reach out to 3 other businesses. They don't have to be in Mountain House. They can be, you know, other in other parts of the East Bay. 146 00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.280 Jenny Duan: Great. And then 147 00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.519 Jenny Duan: the next thing is the video game project. How's that going? 148 00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:26.530 huda siraj: Yeah. So I've been working on like more game art, and I think this time for the footage that I'm getting for, like the devlog I've kind of been emphasizing like 149 00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:50.100 huda siraj: so I'm making Ada Lovelace in the game. So I've been like emphasizing, like the game art a",
    "nd like the process of like finding famous women and stem, and like kind of their history and like, including the reason why I put them there like their character, and how like explaining how they're relevant in my game. 150 00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.680 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 151 00:23:53.190 --> 00:24:00.829 Jenny Duan: That is super super cool. Have you also been able to get your first post up yet or not? Yet 152 00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:09.689 huda siraj: I totally forgot about the social media. I think I'll I'll try to do that today. Actually, I could probably do it after this call. 153 00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:19.900 huda siraj: okay, great. And then it's just like a little introduction post like maybe something about you. And like, while you're working on this game and what you're doing 154 00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.889 Jenny Duan: working 155 00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.050 Jenny Duan: on the game. What are you doing? Alright. Okay. 156 00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.019 Jenny Duan: And then for the Youtube, how is your cross posting going? 157 00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:41.140 Jenny Duan: How's your side? Your your video logging and your footage for gamemark going? 158 00:24:41.420 --> 00:25:06.419 huda siraj: Yeah. So like, I said, kinda like trying to emphasize like the story behind the game rather than like just footage of me working on it. So I've been like collecting like I've been trying to like research more about the characters I'm adding in like Ada Lovelace, and how like the architecture and stuff. And I've been trying to like give it meaning. So in the video, I'm talking about 159 00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:14.140 huda siraj: like, I wanna add this character to represent the women and stem. And I, kinda yeah, I was trying to like. 160 00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:20.070 huda siraj: emphasize that. I'm doing this to encourage women and stuff. 161 00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:27.999 Jenny Duan: Awesome? And so how's your progress on the video? When do you think that will be able t",
    "o be up? 162 00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.320 huda siraj: Probably by the end of the week. 163 00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.859 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So let me just put that in your goals. 164 00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.100 Jenny Duan: And 165 00:25:39.190 --> 00:26:00.890 Jenny Duan: by end of week, okay, amazing. So this is how we are on all of your goals right now. I just wanna take a moment to reflect on how far we've come since the beginning, because look at just all the progress that you've been making on all of your different extracurriculars that we basically only started a couple of weeks ago. So I feel like you should be very proud of. 166 00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:10.689 Jenny Duan: And then, before we move on, I want to see your navience. But do you have any other questions about the plan for this week or anything related to your passion projects. 167 00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:23.130 huda siraj: no, I think I think, for now I'm set also, actually, I wanted to talk about my film editing club. So 168 00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:34.310 huda siraj: we are limited to only meeting like once per month. And the rest we're gonna have to meet virtually. So. We're trying to do like as many projects as possible. 169 00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:42.969 huda siraj: And like, how? How? Many members you think we need to like, be considered like an effective club? 170 00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:50.080 Jenny Duan: I don't think there's a number of members. But usually when the club 171 00:26:50.230 --> 00:27:18.329 Jenny Duan: okay, I think you should try to get as many people to sign up as possible. So give incentives to sign up because you can count everyone who signs up as technically like a member. And that's what. And the number of sign ups and things you need concrete metrics to write down for like common app when they ask you for your club. So think during club fair or during the first week you should try to incentivize as many people to sign up as possible. And you can do that in many diff",
    "erent ways. So I'm just gonna write this down. 172 00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:41.960 Jenny Duan: incentivize people to sign up like, do whatever you can to get people to sign up. You can pass out candy. You can give incentive and do like $25 gift card raffle, or something like that. So like something small, you know, it doesn't have to be big. But your goal should be to get as many people to sign up as possible, because that's like a metric that you need to write down on your college application. 173 00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:58.720 huda siraj: Does that make sense? Yeah, we so our club fair is like 2 days long. So the so during the first one we were able to get 70 members so far, and we're looking to try to like maybe increase that by 174 00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.140 huda siraj: like 50, maybe 175 00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:10.470 Jenny Duan: yeah, you know. Wr, give out Boba, like, do whatever you need to be able to sign up. Because 176 00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:28.480 Jenny Duan: yeah, once they're on that email list like, that's honestly, what's the most important. And then with the film club, what kind of activities are you planning for the film club like are you thinking about? You know, creating a short film. Are you thinking about having students enter like a documentary contest? Or what kinds of projects are you planning with the film club itself? 177 00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.339 huda siraj: So here are some things that we're gonna do. 178 00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:45.169 huda siraj: First, I think we're gonna work on the intro for student news. So that they get something that they get to have on the student news that they show every Thursday cause. And then we also want 179 00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.210 huda siraj: like a feature on 180 00:28:48.260 --> 00:29:03.370 huda siraj: on student news cause. A lot of people are just joining cause they cause everyone wants to be on student news. So what we're gonna do is collaborate with other clubs. And we're thinking of making ",
    "this kind of like a fundraiser. 181 00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:21.979 huda siraj: So every club that wants like an advertisement has to pay us like 15, or $10 and then we could put it put it on mh, TV, like the news. And then that way, by the end of the year we'll have enough money to like, have club T-shirts and such. 182 00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:37.629 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's really awesome. Sounds good. And then let's think about doing something to like mark the longevity of a club, because you want to have people coming back every week for a reason. So what is going to be, in your opinion, the reason why they keep coming back to Film Club. 183 00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.290 I think. 184 00:29:40.330 --> 00:30:01.530 huda siraj: I think like the chance. So we have like in Film Club since we're making like short films and such. I think a lot of people are signed up to be like an actor or actress cause they like wanna, especially the Drama Club people. They wanna like have tangible projects that they can show when they're applying for acting school or for drama. 185 00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:28.930 huda siraj: And so I think that's like a majority of our members are honestly just actors and actresses. But yeah, I think also for our club fair. We had 2 giant camcorders out. So then a lot of people are interested by that. And then so we're also offering that if you join our club. We're looking for 3 officers. So if you wanna officer position, you should apply 186 00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.789 huda siraj: so yeah. 187 00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.240 Jenny Duan: gotcha sounds good. 188 00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.620 Jenny Duan: And 189 00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:56.430 Jenny Duan: so yeah, really exciting that you already have 70 members. That's that's pretty big. Yeah, especially if you're president. So yeah, congratulations. Now, I want to take a second to walk through your navience. I'm wondering if you can share your screen and we can look over some of the data you can find on aud",
    "ience. 190 00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.220 huda siraj: okay, 191 00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.710 huda siraj: Can you see my screen? 192 00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.989 Jenny Duan: Yes, I can. Okay. 193 00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.740 Jenny Duan: oh, interesting. This is different. Okay, maybe go to colleges. 194 00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.770 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then you can 195 00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.059 Jenny Duan: press advanced advance college search. 196 00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:21.890 Jenny Duan: Yes. 197 00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:30.660 Jenny Duan: and okay. Now let's look at let's just search up one school like search up Stanford, for example. 198 00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:40.789 Jenny Duan: have your counselors instructed you to do the quizzes on here like the the Naviance, like 199 00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:53.189 huda siraj: surveys or quizzes, or anything to match you on. No, but I remember last year they were showing like, I think the juniors are the sophomores or no, the juniors or the seniors how to make a resume. 200 00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.560 Jenny Duan: Bye. 201 00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.799 Jenny Duan: Click, yeah, click, Stanford, and then scroll down to the bottom. 202 00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.000 Jenny Duan: Okay. 203 00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.810 Jenny Duan: let's see how many students 204 00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.739 Jenny Duan: are applying. Okay, see? Yeah, this is what I mean. Okay, scroll up 205 00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.240 Jenny Duan: the how do you compare scroll down? 206 00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.370 Jenny Duan: Yes. Okay, this. 207 00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:40.400 Jenny Duan: This is very. This is this, data is gold. Look, because it tells you your high schools, middle 50% of accepted students and the national middle 50. So it looks like right now, your Gpa is low for Stanford compared to hasn't been updated. Maybe it hasn't been updated. 208 00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.580 Jenny Duan: Can you switch it from Gpa weighted to something different? 20",
    "9 00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.479 Jenny Duan: Do you feel cumulative? Maybe. 210 00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.110 Jenny Duan: Is this your Gpa, would you say? Or 211 00:32:52.140 --> 00:33:02.829 huda siraj: I think it was like, yeah, like around. I think it was like 3 94. Something like that. What do you think is wrong with your Gpa. Waited. 212 00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:09.100 huda siraj: I don't think this is like linked to my actual grades. I think I probably updated this like 213 00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.970 huda siraj: freshman year or something. 214 00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.209 Jenny Duan: Okay? So it's not. It's not like, live linked. Okay. 215 00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.569 Jenny Duan: great go. Can you go back to Gpa weighted? 216 00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:26.590 Jenny Duan: So this tells you the benchmark that you need to be if you want to get into a school like Stanford, or you know whatever school that you want to apply for 217 00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:35.089 Jenny Duan: And do you see like? So we can look at other schools later. But you need to get at that. 218 00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:45.320 Jenny Duan: 38 th, 4.3 8 to 4.5 range at least. Now try to get to that upper range like 4.5 Gpa. so that means, like, maybe 219 00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:56.940 Jenny Duan: trying to take more. Ap's your senior year and doing other strategies to get your Gpa up. And then for the sat, you can see at the bottom it doesn't give you any school specific data. I don't think 220 00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:14.949 Jenny Duan: 1330. That's I think you should disregard that. That's too too low. But you can see the national 50% is 13 80 to to 1580, and you should try to get to that upper edge of the range. I think positioning yourself around the top 75 is always a good idea when you're applying for colleges. 221 00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:22.670 Jenny Duan: So you need it. That's why I'm saying that 50, 1550 to 1580 range. Because of that. And then if you scroll down a CT, 222 00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:",
    "28.960 Jenny Duan: you can see 32 to 35 is the range. Obviously you should try to aim for higher like 35. 223 00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.889 Jenny Duan: so 224 00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:38.040 Ivy Mentors: amazing, I've I've never seen. Okay, so this is only ex accessible to students right through school. 225 00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:47.250 Jenny Duan: through school, through navy, on specifically, which is why which is why II was very happy when I heard that who'da had it so I could walk her through how to use it 226 00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:58.160 Ivy Mentors: amazing, amazing. This is absolutely well, I think, also to really motivate and drive like, you know, when you put the the the chart like, you know. Why. 227 00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:09.990 Ivy Mentors: gpa, increasing Gpa and y increasing sat score is important telling like showing the why makes it easy right like then, to really put that rigor. And because then you know why you're doing this 228 00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.380 Ivy Mentors: so 229 00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:15.809 Jenny Duan: and this is Oh, yeah. Sorry to interrupt. Continue. Oh, please start. 230 00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:27.809 Jenny Duan: Oh, Huda, this is what you're talking about before. Right? Like this is, yeah. Your school's application history. 2023. Again, 36 people applied, 2 were accepted and one of them enrolled. 231 00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.500 Jenny Duan: and then in the previous 5 years there has been no one. So 232 00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.340 Jenny Duan: what does that tell them? Right like, you know what what I mean? 233 00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:46.329 Ivy Mentors: That's that's very interesting. So it's like. so it's just that people are not going from here. And then, like people who made it so like 2 people applied, and just one got into Stanford 234 00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.740 Ivy Mentors: is everyone. Remember. 235 00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:55.230 Jenny Duan: 36 people applied, 2 got in and one decided to go. Some one else decided, got ",
    "in, decided to go somewhere else. 236 00:35:55.490 --> 00:36:00.290 Ivy Mentors: Amazing, amazing. So someone has actually changed the game. 237 00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:06.420 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think, what what does that mean? Actually right for like, what does that tell you? 238 00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.519 Ivy Mentors: looking at a school like this, now that 239 00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:21.180 Jenny Duan: you know, maybe you can try some other kind of Ivy League just to see? Oh, Berkeley, Berkeley is good. One. Yeah. Let's see, like, Berkeley, yeah, yeah. 2024, 2081 people are thinking about applying to Berkeley already. 240 00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.340 Jenny Duan: And 241 00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:31.600 Jenny Duan: and then 2023, 147 people applied. How big is your class? How big is? How many people are in a class? 242 00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.960 huda siraj: I think like 400, I think. 243 00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.750 Jenny Duan: Okay. So 244 00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.780 Jenny Duan: almost a threer. More than a third. Actually, students apply to Berkeley. 245 00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:46.999 Jenny Duan: Out of those, 10 are accepted and 5 enrolled last year. 246 00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.020 huda siraj: Wow. 247 00:36:49.710 --> 00:37:07.019 Ivy Mentors: wow, II mean, App, why would this information not be like available to parents? Like, I, yeah, anyway. So I mean that at least like it's, how, how does? How? How do you? How do you know that 20 or 24 like people are planning to apply like, how does the school know about it. 248 00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:22.539 Jenny Duan: because you indicated in naviance, because naviance is how your counselors do your like. Every counselor, has to send information to the school about you, and that's a why it's important to establish relationship with your counselor. But B, why, they use novian, so they can send information about you to the colleges 249 00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.129 Ivy Mentors: that you use to send information to ",
    "colleges. Okay. 250 00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.079 Jenny Duan: look at this. This is gold. Look at this 251 00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:44.359 Jenny Duan: graph of Gpa. And sat with Berkeley. Acceptances. Look, accepted. Stat. 1540, G. 1,500, 58, 4.7 3. That's pretty high 252 00:37:44.420 --> 00:38:00.310 Jenny Duan: excepted, sat 1350 GPA. 4.7 5 7. But remember this, Berkeley doesn't look at your sat Berkeley, in all the Ucs. Are completely test blind, which means, even if you take a sat, they don't look at it. So that's why you could ignore all the things in the SAT. And just look at the GPA. 253 00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.020 Ivy Mentors: Okay, so this is for her school. Right? 254 00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.519 Jenny Duan: Just let's see. can you scroll up, please? 255 00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:16.530 Ivy Mentors: This is, I believe this is for yeah, ex applications for Mounthouse High School. Okay? So can you show me the the extreme right green tick. Like, I like, I want to see, like, who? Yeah. 256 00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.460 Jenny Duan: 4.7 3. So this is last year. Yeah. 257 00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.810 huda siraj: I don't know it 258 00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.130 huda siraj: none. Say. 259 00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.489 Jenny Duan: well, it's all over. 260 00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.450 Ivy Mentors: Sorry. 261 00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.649 Jenny Duan: I think it's all years. 262 00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:35.920 Ivy Mentors: Oh, it's all here, so that's kind of the person who's actually the highest kind of score, right? In terms of 263 00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:41.500 Ivy Mentors: that's kind of that's that's kind of your like, you know. The bar. The bar has been set. 264 00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:55.419 Ivy Mentors: They don't care about your sat. That doesn't matter to them, because they're all test blind. So it's only your Gpa. That matters. 265 00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:01.529 Ivy Mentors: And how do you boost your sorry for migrants? How do you now boost your kind of Gpa, the",
    " only way 266 00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.310 Jenny Duan: take more 267 00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:18.530 huda siraj: Ap. Is the only way out. Yeah, or dual enrollment does dual enrollment give you boosted Gpa, hooded? Yeah, I think so. But for dual enrollment, I think they they don't you have to sign up for that? Since, like freshman year, I think 268 00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.569 Jenny Duan: I see, okay. 269 00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.340 Ivy Mentors: amazing. 270 00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.330 Jenny Duan: Why don't we choose another school? We can look again. 271 00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:35.680 Ivy Mentors: Wow, amazing. So this piece of information is locked with the schools. But kids do have access. Students do have access. 272 00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.399 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's look. Ucla, 1, 40 applied 273 00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:47.549 Jenny Duan: 11 were accepted and 8 enrolled. Okay, that's pretty good. That means like a third of students applied to Berkeley and Ucla. 274 00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.399 Jenny Duan: And then, yeah. 275 00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:50.940 Jenny Duan: it. 276 00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.090 Ivy Mentors: you know. 277 00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.260 huda siraj: And he felt like weightlessly. 278 00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.679 Ivy Mentors: you know what I mean? Yeah. So 279 00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.529 Ivy Mentors: I mean, at least, Uc's looks. 280 00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:13.200 Ivy Mentors: And again, I think at 1 point like we'll have to really like, you know, strategize, and and be realistic and really like. Put all the effort in kind of the dream schools that are 281 00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.739 Ivy Mentors: like not really too out of reach. I mean, that's always good. But 282 00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:21.930 Ivy Mentors: like even to get into like these uses now is tremendously hard. So why not? 283 00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.400 Jenny Duan: Harvard? 16. A pod. One person accepted. 284 00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.689 Jenny Duan: They did not go. 285",
    " 00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:34.039 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. So I think, the history basic like. Only there's only been like one person like. 286 00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.429 Ivy Mentors: yes, some some person I want to know who that person is. 287 00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:52.569 Jenny Duan: That's the same person. Scroll down. I wanna see what the school statistics are. Can you go back to Harvard and go go see what the school statistics are in terms of their gpas and things. 288 00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.210 Jenny Duan: Click down, down, down. Yes, here 289 00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.959 Jenny Duan: this is the good information again that you should look at 290 00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.390 Jenny Duan: your high schools, accepted students and 291 00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:15.160 Ivy Mentors: So how do you see what's on the your school? What does that mean your school like that? AR this. Okay. Her school, like ranges in terms of Gpa. Is like 3.1 8 to 4.1. 292 00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:19.499 Jenny Duan: No, that's Howard acceptance. Gpa is okay. 293 00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:35.399 Jenny Duan: So that's that verbal. I think this data is wrong. But this should be the middle 50 of students who are accepted to Harvard what their Gpas are. But I'm pretty sure this is wrong, because obviously like, that's very low, I think. The girl that wait. 294 00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:45.259 huda siraj: Yeah. The girl that got into Stanford is the same one that got into Harvard as well. So I think. That 4.7 8 is probably her then. 295 00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.969 huda siraj: Yeah, but she's like class of 2023. 296 00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.349 huda siraj: I don't think that many people or I don't think it registered her, but she did get in 297 00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.149 Jenny Duan: are you sure she got it? 298 00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.480 huda siraj: Yeah, I remember she was like, 299 00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:14.579 huda siraj: like the Decca president and like and founder and basically she was like deci",
    "ding if she wanted to go to Harvard or Stanford, so she's having a dilemma, so 300 00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.689 Jenny Duan: I don't. Then maybe just update yet. 301 00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.640 Jenny Duan: cool. But I'm going to Stanford. 302 00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:31.930 Ivy Mentors: But II think this is where II think Jenny, like you know in in in general, like, you know, I would love to understand, because I think there are a lot of students like HUD. Of course, I think we're talking about Hudaya, but also like 303 00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:40.480 Ivy Mentors: in a school like this, and I'm sure that plenty of schools, right? I would imagine the plenty of school that I think this is probably more common than the feeder schools, right? 304 00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:54.489 Ivy Mentors: Because that's gonna be only a few. How do you then really build a game plan? Right? You know, strategy around. For, like, you know, to your point, like. There are some certain benefits that a person like you know, school like this offers right from a strategy perspective. 305 00:42:54.660 --> 00:43:04.449 Ivy Mentors: right? Because she's not in the competitive school, and like she can really stand out so I would love to have that discussion and see like. 306 00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:17.689 Ivy Mentors: because when I looked at, look at this as a parent right like now, II absolutely have no clue about it. Right? So I'm looking at this the first time. So I'm feeling like, Wow, I made the biggest mistake of my life, you know, coming to the city right like putting Hood in a school where 307 00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:25.569 Ivy Mentors: there's probably like in in a decade. Only one person getting into like Stanford and Howard like that doesn't help me to value the school right? But 308 00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:31.509 Ivy Mentors: I think there is still hope or strategies like, that's what I wanna, I wanna see right? Why not? 309 00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:47.990 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah. I think with ",
    "the with schools that don't have as many that aren't sending as many students. It's it's good. If you are a smart student like Huda, like cause you can stand out way more. And I think that comes from making an entire impression on your school like 310 00:43:47.990 --> 00:44:16.439 Jenny Duan: taking up leadership roles in your school, talking to your teachers, principals, etc. I think that's very, very important, because once people believe in you, they will start sending you opportunities, and they will make things possible for you. So that's a good. I think it's important to establish a reputation more as a leader within your school and doing whatever it takes. So like that student council that we were talking about meeting with your counselors, meeting with your teachers, meeting with your principals, and being very vocal about what your aspirations are to them, because then they will be able to help you get there. 311 00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:17.460 Jenny Duan: But 312 00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.609 Jenny Duan: again, it is very difficult. Yeah. 313 00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:29.650 Ivy Mentors: okay, so you're basically saying that this kind of a school like definitely a school recommendation and their support and endorsement is of critical value. 314 00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:39.020 Jenny Duan: and then obviously getting your Gpa up is the most important thing on, I think, honestly, for college admissions. 315 00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:42.409 Jenny Duan: passion project extracurriculars. They can only get you 316 00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:55.209 Jenny Duan: a little bit. But what gets you a lot is your foundation like I said your sat scored, your Gpa, that's the most important. So if you don't have a strong foundation, nothing else can help you. So I think that's why Whoa! It's like very important to 317 00:44:55.250 --> 00:45:10.049 Jenny Duan: take as many Ap's as you can, especially when we forecast for next year, putting as many aps as you can, but obviously that you're t",
    "hat you'll be able to excel in. You don't want to sign up for too many, and then get a bad Gpa. You want to sign up for as many as you can while maintaining high. Gpa. 318 00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.890 Jenny Duan: thank you. 319 00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Here's Brown. You can see 15 applied. One was accepted and one person enrolled. 320 00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.479 huda siraj: Oh, only 15 applied. It seems 321 00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:30.600 Ivy Mentors: not even like daring to apply like, I mean, you know, it's like, okay, I mean, so I it's it's sad. But you know. 322 00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.849 Jenny Duan: Let's see how many Christmas is so sad. 323 00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.810 Ivy Mentors: Same person. 324 00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.760 Jenny Duan: SAT. 1510 GPA. 4.6 they got denied. 325 00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.520 Jenny Duan: Was it the top? 326 00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:58.580 Jenny Duan: Someone has gone from the school. 327 00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:06.920 Ivy Mentors: they should have done something right like right apart from this course, of course, they might have been like very brilliant. But was it really awards? Was it like 328 00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.770 Ivy Mentors: I would love to understand? 329 00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:11.090 Ivy Mentors: Why do you sign up? 330 00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:32.450 Jenny Duan: You asked me earlier, like how college colleges know, even if they don't rank, how students are. This is how they know they have all this data, too, about all their applicants, and they can just compare like, it's very easy to be like, okay, this student has like the best Gpa and the best sat. And they do a bunch of activities. So obviously, we're gonna accept them compared to like somewhere out some another student on this 331 00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:44.380 Jenny Duan: list. So that's how the soon stands out. But obviously, if the student has a very impressive, extracurricular profile they have. If they're very ex excellent in som",
    "e other field, they might accept them, even if they have a lower sat or Gpa compared to the top person. 332 00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.119 Jenny Duan: But schools have all the state as well. And that's how they make decisions, too. 333 00:46:48.630 --> 00:47:01.089 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think, really, this is the problem that I would love to solve right really like for students like for the who because of the you know, schools, and like not having that environment where they are able to really like. 334 00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:08.809 Ivy Mentors: really even aim for these schools, right? Let alone, like, you know, getting in like that, I mean to see, like only 15 people, even applying there to applying like 335 00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:20.710 Ivy Mentors: it's concerning to me. And and I think that is what probably is a is a is a thing to solve right for underserved. Of course I might be a bit biased, because, you know, I'm I'm who does, Dad. And I'm in this environment now. 336 00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:33.360 Ivy Mentors: But that will be very interesting, because you're saying it's still not impossible. But there, that is where I mean, someone has to bring that help right? That's what you are bringing for Huda. And 337 00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:45.370 Ivy Mentors: yeah, very interesting. really, like, you know, enabling really like, non-competitive and non-competitive public school students to get into top Ivs, you know, like, with that kind of help. 338 00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.009 Ivy Mentors: is the underserved one of the underserved segment segments. I would say, Yeah. 339 00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:54.340 Jenny Duan: yeah. For this one, I would just search California Institute of Technology. 340 00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.070 Jenny Duan: It the full name instead of Caltech. 341 00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:10.880 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, we are top of the hour. Jenny, I want to be respectful of your time. So thanks for that. 342 00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:16.139 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Who",
    " do. I would encourage you to just explore this on your own, and then think about 343 00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:29.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah, just think, just think about that. And Dopa, don't be stressed like, don't don't be stressed and don't like Cap yourself. That's what I tell, like everyone, don't give yourself a cap. Don't tell yourself. No. 344 00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.299 Jenny Duan: don't tell yourself like I'm not gonna apply to the school, because. 345 00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:53.409 Jenny Duan: whatever reason you don't want to be the one to reject yourself any. If anything, the call, let the colleges be the one to accept, reject, you, make their decision. But don't tell yourself that you can't do it because you are perfectly capable of aiming, however high you want to go, so don't let any of these statistics change your mental game, because that's the most important thing. 346 00:48:54.070 --> 00:49:19.019 Ivy Mentors: and and you also have a number of powers. You also have an advantage. I think that's what I want to understand, and I will try to bring that out. I think we should bring that out. That being in this kind of a school does not necessarily, like Elim, like, you know, completely shut the doors for you, because there is a trend setter, whoever did that re like respect and kudos to her or him. But I think is you're equally you have the opportunity now, right? You're working with a Stanford amazing 347 00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.949 Ivy Mentors: mentors. I think I want you to have that confidence as well. 348 00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:32.650 Ivy Mentors: So thanks Jenny. But II want to spend some time with all this particular platform. I wanna understand like, this is great news. Yeah, thank you. 349 00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.890 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Go ahead. Talk to you soon. Aye. 350 00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:41.830 Ivy Mentors: cool. Yeah, very helpful, Jenny. How are you doing? 351 00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:58.329 Ivy Mentors: I'm good. I'm been pretty busy. I ",
    "know the resume. I know it's top of mind I'm I'm getting that to you like right now, but don't. Don't, Bob be bothered by my spams. I think you're already so supportive. It's fine, you know. So I just like, whenever you can. 352 00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.140 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, that's fine. But this is very interesting, I think. 353 00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:11.349 Ivy Mentors: I would love us to again. I need to spend some time. So what has happened now is like, I'm really heads down doing the same thing that I did with you in co-creating the college prep 354 00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:22.289 Ivy Mentors: today. I'm spending today and tomorrow with Erin to create the whole college app for her the mastery. Because she's brought a lead. Actually, that's a student from Canada. 355 00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:31.940 Ivy Mentors: So it's again an international event. Right? Yeah. So I mean again, like, I'm I'm very you know, I'm so thankful for the trust that you guys are putting on me right. 356 00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:57.049 Ivy Mentors: And II really want to deliver that back. So I've told her that transparently like, you know, we do 50 50. And then, just because she brought the lead as well, I'm gonna pay her 5 more lead incentive as well. So I want to motivate her. And she's all all in and trying to create that whole college app that's what. So yeah, don't worry about it, I think. Yeah, resume definitely. Send it to me. 357 00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:00.339 Ivy Mentors: Your product document. I will start 358 00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.299 Ivy Mentors: capturing a few things. 359 00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:11.480 Ivy Mentors: You know. Sorry for that kind of very ambiguous start, but I just wanted us to kind of brainstorm and find what is the outcome where you can contribute. 360 00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:22.300 Ivy Mentors: I think you have a knack for strategy and Ops as well. I think you're very strong operationally right? So I'm actually going to evaluate and see like how you can actual",
    "ly also help there. Because. 361 00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.320 Ivy Mentors: yeah, operational stuff is gonna be a critical part of the product. 362 00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:35.579 Ivy Mentors: And that's something. So strategy you you're absolutely strong. So strategies where the strategy is coming along quite well. By the way, now that we have all the kind of sales and stuff like that. 363 00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:46.170 Ivy Mentors: You know, I have a the designer coming up with a very clean and neat kind of a thing. I think 360 ss. Is our magnet use case. We bring on people on board with that, and then we can really sell 2, 3 things. 364 00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.209 Ivy Mentors: That's clear. 365 00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:54.669 Ivy Mentors: One thing I would definitely want, you know, to explore is also the Goto market. Right? 366 00:51:54.710 --> 00:52:00.560 Ivy Mentors: I don't know if I told you. But I'm actually working with you know, a Chinese influencer. 367 00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:16.470 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, she has like this in this platform called Billy Billy. Right? She has like 1 million followers. And she basically makes these videos actually for the international. So 368 00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:21.659 Ivy Mentors: I think she got accepted into yc, as well. so she's slightly busy now. 369 00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:31.879 Ivy Mentors: but I think what I wanted to discuss again, like, you know, because you're in China right now, and you do have an access to that network. And you were the one who initially said about Whatsapp and other things. 370 00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.379 Ivy Mentors: I mean, why don't you want to? I know that there are some barriers there, right? That China is actually cracking down on these kind of services. 371 00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:47.450 Ivy Mentors: But I would love to see if there's any opportunity like, you know, Jenny, you're already maxed out right like. So I'm not gonna give you like, Throw more stuff at you. 372 00:52:47.680 --> 0",
    "0:52:51.460 Ivy Mentors: Let's think about creating new opportunities. Now, why not? Right? 373 00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.979 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah. 374 00:52:53.390 --> 00:53:05.440 Jenny Duan: I remember the way that my mom found my college counselor, like my contractor, who was not helpful. By the way is. He was doing like webinar series, like 2. We chat like he was 375 00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:13.829 Jenny Duan: targeting. He was not Chinese, but he was targeting wechat. And then I was like very effective, I think, cause my mom signed up, and I'm sure other people did, too. So 376 00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:22.429 Ivy Mentors: so why don't we kind of experiment that you know I would love to like, you know you kind of doing a webinar, and then bringing like just a 360 assess like, you know why not? 377 00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.999 Ivy Mentors: And I'm yeah. 378 00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:30.230 Ivy Mentors: I mean, or anyone else, right? It doesn't have to be. Or we could have a recorded kind of a session where we can. 379 00:53:30.300 --> 00:54:00.180 Jenny Duan: That's what I'm thinking, like one way that we can do leads. And I know my friend in Korea. She knows people who do. This, too, is like they they host a session. This is for parents. They do like 1 h session. They do a panel they bring in like 5 students, Stanford or Harvard, or whatever schools, 5 students. They do, a panel. They charge like $15, $20, $30 whatever X amount for admission to that panel, and then they they talk about the college application process in it on a high level 380 00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.829 and explain it to parents. 381 00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:14.659 Jenny Duan: That's one way we can target parents and also get new leads is do like a panel charge for entry. You can figure out however much you want to charge, it can be whatever. But then, just explaining the college application process. 382 00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:27.769 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. I think this really should be your go to m",
    "arket strategy. Okay, ours, like, honestly like, you know, Korea and the Asian market. If you could really strategize and tell what is a good strategy to get on board 383 00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:48.400 Ivy Mentors: and even if it means, like Nico kind of hiring someone there. Like, if you say, Okay, we probably should hire some local person who can be an agent who can probably, like, you know, do you be a salesperson? You know, there are a lot of sales and marketing teams today, actually, who ping you in Linkedin, who say that we can help you grow your business in Apac. We can help you grow your business in Mia Middle East and Africa. 384 00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:57.369 Ivy Mentors: But I wanted to take that ownership, and what I wanted to discuss with you is really a go to market engagement. So you help really crack that model enable me. 385 00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.620 Ivy Mentors: and whatever we sell, we can have a revenue share on that. Why not? 386 00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:17.849 Ivy Mentors: Why, why should I be like relying? See, I was trying to rely on, you know. Actually, I was working with a Stanford research student from China, who came to Oxford. I don't know if I told you she's worked in one of the biggest counseling services in China for 3 years. 387 00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:25.220 Ivy Mentors: Okay, as a counselor, and she wanted me. She connected me to that Chinese kind of crimson. 388 00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:34.479 Ivy Mentors: So I was actually even exploring a go-to-market partnership with a third party kind of direct engagement, like, you know, hey? I know that you have all these services. 389 00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:45.719 Ivy Mentors: And you what they need is actually students, right? And I'm like, okay, I can be that kind of point of contact. And you give me all the students, and we can work on that F short model. Why do I do that if I can directly do it like through? 390 00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:48.490 Ivy Mentors: You know, you or any other contact?",
    " Right? So 391 00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:57.479 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I think I think I'm I'm just throwing it up, because, you know, like Edin from nowhere, she like again said, Oh, I have a Canadian student. And 392 00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:08.929 Ivy Mentors: I said, how did you come to know about it? Oh, they're like, through some of my family friends network, you know. And she wanted to get some help. And I said, Hey, you know what? Actually, you know. Come and join ib mentors. So I'm like, Okay, why not? 393 00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:17.790 Ivy Mentors: Great? Okay? Sorry. I'm taking your time. So send me that. Cv, I want to get started. I think the other one you saw that? 394 00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:23.670 Ivy Mentors: while you're still in Beijing, you know. Honestly, if there's a possibility. Oh, you're not in Beijing. Okay. 395 00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:47.960 Ivy Mentors: But why do you can take up a call right like I can ask him like, Hey, if some director is available, like, you know, let him let him talk to you know. What he told me is that, regardless of wherever you want to work like? He looked at your profile, and then immediately said, Does she know, mandarin? I said, yes, she knows, and then he's like it would be so easy for her in a company like tick tock to just like climb up the ladder right? Like language is such a such an important asset. 396 00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:50.829 Ivy Mentors: So you see, like I, you didn't even tell me. But 397 00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:56.040 Ivy Mentors: let me. Yeah, let me talk to someone. II will do anything. Basically. 398 00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:02.359 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I know that, you know. If you get Google, then you can always ditch Tiktok. I would tell you to go to Google. But why not? You know? 399 00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.480 Jenny Duan: Alright, totally 400 00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:11.320 Ivy Mentors: okay. I'm looking forward. Okay. So by the way, 2 things. Minkio, I don't know if I've said, but that's gonna be on Satur",
    "day. 401 00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:17.690 Jenny Duan: See? Neema still hasn't paid, you see, like this is the whole challenge it's not in. But Anrushka did book 402 00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.840 Ivy Mentors: for Monday. 403 00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:25.270 Ivy Mentors: and I told Nelma, you know it's fine, you know. Just pay like before, like last time. Hoop! 404 00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:30.879 Ivy Mentors: But you know, closing, closing the last mile is not easy, especially, you know, these are big packages, right? 405 00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.120 Ivy Mentors: So 406 00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:39.599 Ivy Mentors: right well she has to pay for the session. Otherwise, you know, there's no session. So, but at least she has a 407 00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:53.770 Ivy Mentors: track record, right? She has a history that not like Shashi, right, who has a track record of just squeezing like free. You see now why I did not send you a video. You might have thought, why is he not sending it? I knew this guy was a freebie right? He was trying to squeeze and extract. 408 00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:59.000 Ivy Mentors: and I sent him that proposal of $1,800. That's it. The guy has not shown up 409 00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.930 Ivy Mentors: like he's completely vanished. 410 00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:07.420 Ivy Mentors: Right? So yeah, I mean, but that's up to me, I mean, don't worry about it. Yeah, awesome 411 00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:27.650 Ivy Mentors: cool. So I just wanted to set like, go to market. I think I'm gonna focus on that because I feel like you're already maxed out. And but I think there is opportunity for you to, you know, because you've been such an integral part of really co-creating this, you're helping me on the Pm. Side, and like I can really enable more like, you know. Why? Why should I not talk about that, you know. 412 00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:35.480 Ivy Mentors: So yeah, help me out, you know. Let let me know, like you know, what? What's a good channel and way, and talk to your mo",
    "m and talk to your friends? 413 00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.390 Ivy Mentors: You know, either in China or even like Korea, as an example like I'm more than happy. 414 00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.789 Jenny Duan: Sounds good. Thanks. Send me the Cv. Bye."
