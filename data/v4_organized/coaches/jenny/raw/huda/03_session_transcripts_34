Yeah, it's working. Okay? Sounds good. 3 00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.830 Jenny Duan: It's good to see you. And it's been a week. How is there a week? Catch me up on what you've been up to? 4 00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.789 huda siraj: It's been going pretty well. I'm kind of tired because I've been feeling under the weather. But yeah, other than that, like, I think 5 00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.699 huda siraj: made lots of progress. And 6 00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.960 huda siraj: I think, yeah, I'm I'm starting to see some results. And I'm pretty happy about that. 7 00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:23.379 Jenny Duan: hey? Tell me more about the results. Also, I'm sorry to hear that you're you've been feeling sick. I also got really sick last week I had a fever for a couple of days, so definitely drink lots of water and and make sure to take time to rest. 8 00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.959 huda siraj: Yeah, thank you. Okay, so I guess I'll start with 9 00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:42.869 huda siraj: So I guess there was like a kind of a bad thing that happened this week. So for empowering AI, we're supposed to have our first day of the boot camp and no one showed up. So 10 00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:57.329 huda siraj: yeah, we just kinda like waste our time like waiting for people to enter. And we already had like 6 people. That were about to join. But they didn't. So we're kinda like restarting the boot camp, I guess. 11 00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:25.659 huda siraj: Cause. yeah. So I started like advertising more aggressively on. Facebook. And we got like like 6 sign ups. But this time, like on the form II made like an agreement so like by checking this box, I agreed to attend like every meeting or also could be some penalty. I don't know what the penalty is, but I just mentioned it so that people show up. And then, 12 00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.490 huda siraj: yeah. So for empowering AI, we also discontinued our like partnership with the other nonprofit, because 13 00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:57.889 huda siraj: she hasn't really contributed anything to the boot camp itself. And the whole reason, like I kind of partnered with her, was so that we can get like a larger audience, cause she has connections to lots of nonprofits for, like AI education for younger girls as well. So it's kinda like counting on that. But she hasn't got us like a single person. So we kind of discontinued that 14 00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:19.170 huda siraj: but yeah, also, I don't know if I told you this last time. But we decided like April seventh April seventh. Yeah, we're gonna hold the meeting with the student from Carnegie Mellon. And I met with her, and I talked to her about like I talked about like logistics of the event. 15 00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.799 huda siraj: And yeah, that's about it for empowering. AI 16 00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:39.259 huda siraj: So this time we've like been really strict and we've kind of been like sending out the links like way before hand, so that they like know that they have to show up. And like, we're like constantly emailing them. So they remember, 17 00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:52.030 huda siraj: And yeah, so we should like, in theory, we should have like 12 kids show up. But hopefully it goes by plan. When are you restarting it again? This Saturday. 18 00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.750 huda siraj: and then, yeah. So I think that's it for empowering AI 19 00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.150 huda siraj: So for folklift. I did like send out like on Linkedin, like I posted about 20 00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:29.970 huda siraj: I'm calling on the cultural ambassador like a role so that they can like write constantly for the journal and so far, 2 people applied and I sent them like emails and stuff. So they haven't like gone back to me. So I think I'm I just connected with one of them on Linkedin and message them like asking for kind of like 21 00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.599 huda siraj: more questions, so that they can like follow through, you know. And 22 00:04:37.570 --> 00:05:03.490 huda siraj: yeah. And then also, I started like, kind of looking for people to help me organize I'm gonna do like an event where we can like physically write like letters calling for ceasefire. And we're gonna like mail them to our governor. So yeah, I'm looking for like other Muslim girls who can help me like organize that, or like just like pro Palestinian people in general. Yeah. 23 00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:17.549 huda siraj: for folklift. Yeah. Also, I'm trying to make more like Instagram posts. So that can be more active on there. But yeah, just some of the process of like making some preset ones. I can post them throughout the week. 24 00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:26.809 huda siraj: but yeah, that's it for folklift and oh, yeah, the podcast 25 00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:41.100 huda siraj: one of the podcast people that reached out to me. We talked and he said, we're gonna film, our like our segment. In April. Yeah, we're gonna be like. 26 00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:54.780 huda siraj: he's gonna interview. And he's gonna ask about like AI like he asked me. He told me the questions he's gonna ask. And he's like he's gonna ask about like, what do I think of AI and like we'll like, take over jobs. So I think that's gonna be valuable. 27 00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.409 huda siraj: Oh, yeah. And then I think. 28 00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:13.040 huda siraj: I also reached out to this other. Podcast I think it was like games for change or something. And she replied, and she said that I that she'd love to mention me on her podcast and she actually like she 29 00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:24.300 huda siraj: one didn't have me on like an episode, but she said she was like hosting one with someone interested in AI, and she'd mentioned it. So yeah, I'm pretty excited about that. Cause she's 30 00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.500 huda siraj: yeah. 31 00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:33.809 huda siraj: Yeah. So she kinda like, she followed me back on Instagram and everything. So yeah, that's pretty cool. 32 00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.329 Jenny Duan: How many followers does she have? 33 00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:45.670 huda siraj: actually, I'm not sure if her Instagram is really famous. But I know she's pretty popular on linkedin. Let me try to 34 00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.859 huda siraj: finder actually, funer later.

And then 37 00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:09.589 huda siraj: oh, yeah, cmu, I finished editing like the essays. So we just need to like kind of check over them real quick. 38 00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:22.120 huda siraj: I didn't actually didn't get to work on the coding classy essays yet today. But yeah, I'm in a brain storm today. and 39 00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.300 huda siraj: trying to think if there's anything else 40 00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:48.889 huda siraj: filmmakers club we're done with we're done with our like editing for the trailers.

I'm gonna put it on student use and everything to like, publicize it better. 41 00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.900 huda siraj: And yeah, so I'm pretty excited about that. 42 00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:05.709 huda siraj: We're trying to get like the whole thing edited. But yeah, right now, we just have the trailer. yeah. And then I asked my teachers for the recommendation for Cmu as well. 43 00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:14.620 Jenny Duan: Awesome sounds good. And I want you to get involved with, like a National board for an existing organization. 44 00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:25.980 Jenny Duan: I feel like that would be really good, because I feel like you already have a lot of progress in like sharing your own initiative. But I feel like it'd be good for you to like get a leadership role in a big national organization. 45 00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.049 Jenny Duan: I'm trying to see if we can get you on like 46 00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:38.429 Jenny Duan: and like a National Youth Advisory Council for some organization or 47 00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.840 Jenny Duan: like something like that.

Director of Stanford University. Oh, I know. Marisha. Okay, I know her advisor at Government of Kenya. Okay, this is too much. 73 00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.930 Jenny Duan: let's see if this has a get involved. 74 00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.070 Jenny Duan: Our advisor. Oh, they have a Youth Advisor Board. 75 00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:50.359 Jenny Duan: This one could be good national. They're not currently accepting new members. Let's see, when they said meat. 76 00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.589 Jenny Duan: Okay, I would maybe email them 77 00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.199 Jenny Duan: and ask them when they're going to app, apply when they're going to seek new members. 78 00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.760 Jenny Duan: So let me put a note contact 79 00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.250 Jenny Duan: and then. 80 00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:21.850 Jenny Duan: Emil Nicholas. about yeah Advisory Board. 81 00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:34.909 Jenny Duan: and then I don't think Mountain House I didn't look. I didn't look for this earlier, but I did a search for this earlier, but I don't think that Mountain House has too many. 82 00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:41.840 huda siraj: We have a youth action committee, and like, I'm a like a member. But 83 00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:55.989 huda siraj: they don't really like send like updates, like when we have meetings and stuff. So like, I'm not too involved. Okay, they don't. You don't have regular meetings? They do. I think II think if I like email like the 84 00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:10.389 huda siraj: I'm with the organizer. I can probably like start attending the meetings. More cause I only like I had to ask her like when the next meeting is last time. So I don't really know when they are. But I can ask her like to send me updates. Okay, why don't you start doing that more. 85 00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.700 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 86 00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.169 Jenny Duan: let's see if 87 00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.569 Jenny Duan: Do you know who this is? 88 00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.800 huda siraj: No. 89 00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.240 Jenny Duan: okay. 90 00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.219 huda siraj: I'm looking at what other people I'm not.

Besides, the Use Action Committee, is there anything like other leadership you can do within Mountain House like Mount House. What is this part of San Jose? Broader area? What's the broader city? 95 00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.330 Jenny Duan: Tracy is like the closest one. Tracy. 96 00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.039 Jenny Duan: there's a youth advisory.

I'm gonna look into this later, but I think it would be good for you to have some more like establish leaders of position beyond your own initiatives as well. That'd be like a good thing to add to your profile. Do you know, when you start hearing back about like Bank of America. 100 00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.279 huda siraj: Late March and early April. 101 00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.910 huda siraj: Okay, that's been so long scholars right now. 102 00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.560 Jenny Duan: Let me go to that, doc right now. 103 00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:10.930 huda siraj: Oh, yeah.

Okay. 105 00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.600 Jenny Duan: let me start on the beginning. 106 00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.510 huda siraj: Just yeah.

I think this could be better. 118 00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:33.080 Jenny Duan: 119 00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.589 Jenny Duan: maybe like something like 120 00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.110 Jenny Duan: driving home from school like. 121 00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:57.470 Jenny Duan: Do you drive home every day from school?

What do you think would be better? 162 00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:18.569 huda siraj: either we can do that, or we can be like walking back from school every day. The smell of the year and endless fields of grass remind me of a 163 00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.370 huda siraj: of a red flicker red 164 00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.790 huda siraj: farmhouse like. 165 00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:32.959 huda siraj: okay, actually, no, that doesn't make sense.

Sounds like a lot better. But yeah, if we wanted to change the imparted on me. 199 00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:32.149 huda siraj: we could probably say like induced maybe 200 00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.929 huda siraj: but I like has imparted on me. Better be honest. 201 00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.510 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good.

And what did you change on this one? 210 00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:35.239 huda siraj: Well, like, almost changed it a lot. It's like. oh, yeah, okay, yeah. This one wasn't the one I choose a lot. But 211 00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:40.409 huda siraj: okay, here, I tried like going in deeper about like 212 00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.390 huda siraj: specific examples of like 213 00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:59.720 huda siraj: AI being used like unethically but I don't know. These are like to like cause it's not really unethical like are these are examples of it being unethically but like, just like examples of people using AI, and it's so like, 214 00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.790 huda siraj: like accessible And then 215 00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.950 huda siraj: here, I don't like the way I like, explained it like 216 00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:15.620 huda siraj: I didn't really explain AI ethics that will. But I was thinking like like rewarding this. 217 00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.569 huda siraj: but the cons of using them 218 00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.880 Jenny Duan: in. 219 00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.550 Jenny Duan: They bring forth a question of ethics. 220 00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:47.039 Jenny Duan: then over reliance 221 00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.719 Jenny Duan: on AI tools, especially without 222 00:26:52.420 --> 00:27:03.309 Jenny Duan: considering the data that shapes generative AI algorithms for the people they impact. 223 00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.980 Jenny Duan: We'll 224 00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.790 Jenny Duan: reduce 225 00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.510 Jenny Duan: well. 226 00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:24.570 Jenny Duan: trivialize the human experience and the 227 00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.980 Jenny Duan: and the 228 00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.190 Jenny Duan: value 229 00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.340 Jenny Duan: in like, what 230 00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:52.260 huda siraj: what would you say here? the value in like, I said, like human touch. But like 231 00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:54.630 huda siraj: of 232 00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.869 huda siraj: social interaction, maybe. 233 00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.800 Jenny Duan: But I feel like, AI doesn't really impact social interaction specifically. 234 00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.920 huda siraj: oh, and human ideas. Yeah. 235 00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.189 Jenny Duan: okay, can you like this? Yeah. 236 00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.949 Jenny Duan: But what do you think about this sentence that we added. 237 00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:30.380 huda siraj: yeah, that sounds like a lot better. Yeah, I think. 238 00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.480 huda siraj: Yeah, I think he explains that a lot better. Yeah. 239 00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:54.699 Jenny Duan: okay, perfect. Unfortunately, many minorities, such as women, those experiencing financial disability, people of color and others are further marginalized in this field report by the AI now institute highlights that only 2% of authors at Major AI conferences are women. More than 80% of AI professors are men. This disparity extends beyond gender with underrepresented minorities and tag facing significant barriers. And just. 240 00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.919 Jenny Duan: yes, this is very good. 241 00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.909 huda siraj: This is very good. I like it. Thank you. Corporate all the suggestions. 242 00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:08.610 Jenny Duan: yeah, this is good. 243 00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.999 Jenny Duan: I feel really good about this lesson. 244 00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.779 huda siraj: Okay, what do you think about it? 245 00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:34.940 huda siraj: Yeah, I think. This isn't my favorite essay, I'd say, but I think it's like better than before. Wait, it's not your favorite. What can we do to improve it? What's off about it? I just feel like I know this, I think it's because of the question, but like I feel like there's not much of like a storytelling kind of like 246 00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:42.330 huda siraj: aspect to it. Like not many anecdotes, but I think it's because of the question. So 247 00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.250 huda siraj: I guess it makes sense. 248 00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.700 Okay? 249 00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:59.729 huda siraj: Cause then, like the next one, I use like a lot of storytelling, for of like the misrepresentation of like people color and AI 250 00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.779 huda siraj: but yeah. 251 00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:35.109 huda siraj: I think. Wait. Let me change. I feel like, instead of extensive and beneficial. We can do like a like efficient and hmm 252 00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:43.999 huda siraj: a enhancing. But I think beneficent is fine. I think beneficial is fine, too. Yeah. 253 00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.410 Jenny Duan: time 254 00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.990 Jenny Duan: over 255 00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.010 Jenny Duan: these applications. 256 00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.080 Jenny Duan: So can you name the social inequity that 257 00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:23.859 Jenny Duan: you are mentioning in this essay? And what the specific harm is? 258 00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.690 huda siraj: I guess, like 259 00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:41.530 huda siraj: you know, the fear that, like AI is like taking over jobs like, I think, like a lot of people are scared of, like like the lack of human specialization. And AI, and like not just a L like every single field 260 00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.120 huda siraj: like shh. 261 00:31:43.580 --> 00:32:01.160 huda siraj: for example, like art, like AI generated art, is like like stealing other people's art styles and like AI ethics. And one way it came to solve that, because, like now, if you try to generate like art styles into style of someone else. It doesn't work. 262 00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:06.099 huda siraj: so yeah, like, kind of a. 263 00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:11.959 huda siraj: it's kind of like ripping off like human specialization. 264 00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.860 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. yeah, I think that's that's good. 265 00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.280 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel like, that's. 266 00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.949 huda siraj: I think you name it here. So I think this is fine. Yeah. 267 00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.390 Jenny Duan: yeah, this is, I feel good about this and say, if you like, I can approve it. 268 00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.020 huda siraj: Alright. 269 00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:41.300 Jenny Duan: okay. This you also 270 00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:42.820 is this finished? 271 00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.580 huda siraj: Yeah. 272 00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:49.830 huda siraj: Bunch of enters right there like this. Right? Yeah. 273 00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.730 Jenny Duan: Let me read over this one more time. 274 00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.450 Jenny Duan: Oh, by the way, are you going to Pakistan? This weekend? 275 00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:33.609 huda siraj: No, it was like it was too late, cause I was like asking my dad to like book the like flight, and like settings like and like hotel and stuff. So we weren't able to and also have, like the sharp tank project, which, if I'm absent like my English, is just gonna kill me. So yeah, that makes sense. That's okay. Next time 276 00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:42.979 Jenny Duan: the hackathons are really fun, though my sister is going and my other friends sisters are also going. So next time you should go, I think that they are usually pretty fun. 277 00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.840 huda siraj: Yeah, I think I'll probably like sign up for a different one. Yeah. 278 00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.390 Jenny Duan: cool. 279 00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.130 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 280 00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:37.650 Jenny Duan: I would also bring in. I would not maybe mention Cynthoria this one, because you already talked about Cynthia I would talk about. I think you mentioned folklift, and how like in your community already, you already advocate, for, like diversity through the Folklift initiative and 281 00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:48.419 Jenny Duan: like, bring that in like. Don't be afraid to mention, like other clubs and organizations that you're part of, or even saying, like representing your community through the Youth Action Committee like, I think you can name drop that as well. 282 00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.310 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Yeah. 283 00:34:50.489 --> 00:35:07.609 Jenny Duan: I think I mentioned like folklore to the earlier paragraph. But like, yeah, I think this paragraph kind of talking about like AI ethics a little bit 284 00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:18.419 Jenny Duan: I think you can mentioned like the Youth Action Committee, too. That's and like maybe volunteering in the Muslim community. I think that's all like very valuable here. So I'll make a note for you to that. 285 00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:33.040 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't love this first sentence doesn't really add much to your essay. 286 00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.950 huda siraj: Yeah, I think I could definitely rewrite that 287 00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.750 huda siraj: sharing 288 00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.750 Jenny Duan: quarantine 289 00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.979 Jenny Duan: during the pandemic 290 00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:56.930 Jenny Duan: teachers can say across the United States. They're cool. 291 00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:19.019 Jenny Duan: emphasize. put in present tense. 292 00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.390 Jenny Duan: Hey? Let's change it to present tense 293 00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:38.370 Jenny Duan: I'm contributing instead of I've attempted to contribute. We change it to. I'm contributing 294 00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:42.330 Jenny Duan: with. 295 00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:59.219 Jenny Duan: oh, I think it's fine if you mentioned Thoria here, but I would also mention, like the some of the other things you are part of, because I feel like you have extra words. 296 00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, oh, no, not really. 297 00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:07.630 huda siraj: Okay. I could cut back on this and thorium. Maybe I can. 298 00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.210 huda siraj: With my initiative. 299 00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.079 Jenny Duan: This was my first video game. 300 00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:25.869 Jenny Duan: I think if you just mentioned in Thoria, you don't have to say the rest of it, because you already have dedicated to Cyoria. So I think it's fine if you just end it here and then like, maybe 301 00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.450 Jenny Duan: beyond 302 00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:38.440 Jenny Duan: these organizations, I aim to bring my background in advancing equity through 303 00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:47.700 Jenny Duan: he. Mountain House Youth Action Committee. and my 304 00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:54.400 Jenny Duan: perspectives volunteering at my local mosque to. 305 00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:58.470 Jenny Duan: I've been to bring my background to 306 00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.070 Jenny Duan: informing my 307 00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.390 Jenny Duan: my leadership forward. 308 00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:19.800 Jenny Duan: Yeah, beyond these organizations, I aim to bring my background to it for my leadership. Forward. What do you think about this sentence? 309 00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:24.899 huda siraj: Okay, so 310 00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:30.700 huda siraj: my perspectives. Volunteering at my local boss to inform my leadership. Forward. 311 00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:41.750 huda siraj: wait. II don't really understand like this part where it says took in for my leadership, for like I mean, I think that's probably because of me. But 312 00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:48.830 Jenny Duan: no, I think if you don't understand it, they don't understand it, too. To. I think it's just like to 313 00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:56.930 Jenny Duan: make you a more thoughtful leader, or to like help you improve your leadership. But I don't know what the best way to word that is. What do you think 314 00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:07.600 huda siraj: like saying that you're a better leader because you can consider diverse perspectives. If that makes sense. Yeah, to 315 00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:18.310 huda siraj: like, okay, I'm gonna do like a bad sentence. But take diverse 316 00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.620 huda siraj: opinions and 317 00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:27.819 huda siraj: wait. Let me type it like and take some time for 318 00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.530 huda siraj: opinions, views, and back 319 00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:37.880 huda siraj: in my leadership 320 00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.800 huda siraj: in in my role as a leader. 321 00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.290 Jenny Duan: Okay. 322 00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.730 huda siraj: yeah, I think like, intake doesn't sound right. 323 00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.279 huda siraj: Diverse diversity. 324 00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.110 huda siraj: mono diverse 325 00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.310 huda siraj: to 326 00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.260 huda siraj: input. No, no, no, that doesn't make sense. 327 00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:12.770 huda siraj: to consider. Yeah, to consider. 328 00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:38.079 Jenny Duan: Think the sentence is a bit too verbose. It's a bit too long. 329 00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.180 huda siraj: Yeah. 330 00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:42.369 Jenny Duan: leverage my background. 331 00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.680 Jenny Duan: 2, 332 00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.040 Jenny Duan: maybe.

Yeah, it's working. Okay? Sounds good. 3 00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.830 Jenny Duan: It's good to see you. And it's been a week. How is there a week? Catch me up on what you've been up to? 4 00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.789 huda siraj: It's been going pretty well. I'm kind of tired because I've been feeling under the weather. But yeah, other than that, like, I think 5 00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.699 huda siraj: made lots of progress. And 6 00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.960 huda siraj: I think, yeah, I'm I'm starting to see some results. And I'm pretty happy about that. 7 00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:23.379 Jenny Duan: hey? Tell me more about the results. Also, I'm sorry to hear that you're you've been feeling sick. I also got really sick last week I had a fever for a couple of days, so definitely drink lots of water and and make sure to take time to rest. 8 00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.959 huda siraj: Yeah, thank you. Okay, so I guess I'll start with 9 00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:42.869 huda siraj: So I guess there was like a kind of a bad thing that happened this week. So for empowering AI, we're supposed to have our first day of the boot camp and no one showed up. So 10 00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:57.329 huda siraj: yeah, we just kinda like waste our time like waiting for people to enter. And we already had like 6 people. That were about to join. But they didn't. So we're kinda like restarting the boot camp, I guess. 11 00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:25.659 huda siraj: Cause. yeah. So I started like advertising more aggressively on. Facebook. And we got like like 6 sign ups. But this time, like on the form II made like an agreement so like by checking this box, I agreed to attend like every meeting or also could be some penalty. I don't know what the penalty is, but I just",
    " mentioned it so that people show up. And then, 12 00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.490 huda siraj: yeah. So for empowering AI, we also discontinued our like partnership with the other nonprofit, because 13 00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:57.889 huda siraj: she hasn't really contributed anything to the boot camp itself. And the whole reason, like I kind of partnered with her, was so that we can get like a larger audience, cause she has connections to lots of nonprofits for, like AI education for younger girls as well. So it's kinda like counting on that. But she hasn't got us like a single person. So we kind of discontinued that 14 00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:19.170 huda siraj: but yeah, also, I don't know if I told you this last time. But we decided like April seventh April seventh. Yeah, we're gonna hold the meeting with the student from Carnegie Mellon. And I met with her, and I talked to her about like I talked about like logistics of the event. 15 00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.799 huda siraj: And yeah, that's about it for empowering. AI 16 00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:39.259 huda siraj: So this time we've like been really strict and we've kind of been like sending out the links like way before hand, so that they like know that they have to show up. And like, we're like constantly emailing them. So they remember, 17 00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:52.030 huda siraj: And yeah, so we should like, in theory, we should have like 12 kids show up. But hopefully it goes by plan. When are you restarting it again? This Saturday. 18 00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.750 huda siraj: and then, yeah. So I think that's it for empowering AI 19 00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.150 huda siraj: So for folklift. I did like send out like on Linkedin, like I posted about 20 00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:29.970 huda siraj: I'm calling on the cultural ambassador like a role so that they can like write constantly for the journal and so far, 2 people applied and I sent them like emails and stuff. So they haven't like gone back to me. So I think I'",
    "m I just connected with one of them on Linkedin and message them like asking for kind of like 21 00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.599 huda siraj: more questions, so that they can like follow through, you know. And 22 00:04:37.570 --> 00:05:03.490 huda siraj: yeah. And then also, I started like, kind of looking for people to help me organize I'm gonna do like an event where we can like physically write like letters calling for ceasefire. And we're gonna like mail them to our governor. So yeah, I'm looking for like other Muslim girls who can help me like organize that, or like just like pro Palestinian people in general. Yeah. 23 00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:17.549 huda siraj: for folklift. Yeah. Also, I'm trying to make more like Instagram posts. So that can be more active on there. But yeah, just some of the process of like making some preset ones. I can post them throughout the week. 24 00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:26.809 huda siraj: but yeah, that's it for folklift and oh, yeah, the podcast 25 00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:41.100 huda siraj: one of the podcast people that reached out to me. We talked and he said, we're gonna film, our like our segment. In April. Yeah, we're gonna be like. 26 00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:54.780 huda siraj: he's gonna interview. And he's gonna ask about like AI like he asked me. He told me the questions he's gonna ask. And he's like he's gonna ask about like, what do I think of AI and like we'll like, take over jobs. So I think that's gonna be valuable. 27 00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.409 huda siraj: Oh, yeah. And then I think. 28 00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:13.040 huda siraj: I also reached out to this other. Podcast I think it was like games for change or something. And she replied, and she said that I that she'd love to mention me on her podcast and she actually like she 29 00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:24.300 huda siraj: one didn't have me on like an episode, but she said she was like hosting one with someone interested in AI, and she'd mentioned it. So yeah, I'm pretty exci",
    "ted about that. Cause she's 30 00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.500 huda siraj: yeah. 31 00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:33.809 huda siraj: Yeah. So she kinda like, she followed me back on Instagram and everything. So yeah, that's pretty cool. 32 00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.329 Jenny Duan: How many followers does she have? 33 00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:45.670 huda siraj: actually, I'm not sure if her Instagram is really famous.

And then 37 00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:09.589 huda siraj: oh, yeah, cmu, I finished editing like the essays. So we just need to like kind of check over them real quick. 38 00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:22.120 huda siraj: I didn't actually didn't get to work on the coding classy essays yet today. But yeah, I'm in a brain storm today. and 39 00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.300 huda siraj: trying to think if there's anything else 40 00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:48.889 huda siraj: filmmakers club we're done with we're done with our like editing for the trailers.

But 211 00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:40.409 huda siraj: okay, here, I tried like going in deeper about like 212 00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.390 huda siraj: specific examples of like 213 00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:59.720 huda siraj: AI being used like unethically but I don't know. These are like to like cause it's not really unethical like are these are examples of it being unethically but like, just like examples of people using AI, and it's so like, 214 00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.790 huda siraj: like accessible And then 215 00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.950 huda siraj: here, I don't like the way I like, explained it like 216 00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:15.620 huda siraj: I didn't really explain AI ethics that will. But I was thinking like like rewarding this. 217 00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.569 huda siraj: but the cons of using them 218 00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.880 Jenny Duan: in. 219 00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.550 Jenny Duan: They bring forth a question of ethics. 220 00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:47.039 Jenny Duan: then over reliance 221 00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.719 Jenny Duan: on AI tools, especially without 222 00:26:52.420 --> 00:27:03.309 Jenny Duan: considering the data that shapes generative AI algorithms for the people they impact. 223 00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.980 Jenny Duan: We'll 224 00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.790 Jenny Duan: reduce 225 00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.510 Jenny Duan: well. 226 00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:24.570 Jenny Duan: trivialize the human experience and the 227 00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.980 Jenny Duan: and the 228 00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.190 Jenny Duan: value 229 00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.340 Jenny Duan: in like, what 230 00:27:43.0",
    "00 --> 00:27:52.260 huda siraj: what would you say here? the value in like, I said, like human touch. But like 231 00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:54.630 huda siraj: of 232 00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.869 huda siraj: social interaction, maybe. 233 00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.800 Jenny Duan: But I feel like, AI doesn't really impact social interaction specifically. 234 00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.920 huda siraj: oh, and human ideas. Yeah. 235 00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.189 Jenny Duan: okay, can you like this? Yeah. 236 00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.949 Jenny Duan: But what do you think about this sentence that we added. 237 00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:30.380 huda siraj: yeah, that sounds like a lot better. Yeah, I think. 238 00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.480 huda siraj: Yeah, I think he explains that a lot better. Yeah. 239 00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:54.699 Jenny Duan: okay, perfect. Unfortunately, many minorities, such as women, those experiencing financial disability, people of color and others are further marginalized in this field report by the AI now institute highlights that only 2% of authors at Major AI conferences are women. More than 80% of AI professors are men. This disparity extends beyond gender with underrepresented minorities and tag facing significant barriers. And just. 240 00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.919 Jenny Duan: yes, this is very good. 241 00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.909 huda siraj: This is very good. I like it. Thank you. Corporate all the suggestions. 242 00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:08.610 Jenny Duan: yeah, this is good. 243 00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.999 Jenny Duan: I feel really good about this lesson. 244 00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.779 huda siraj: Okay, what do you think about it? 245 00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:34.940 huda siraj: Yeah, I think. This isn't my favorite essay, I'd say, but I think it's like better than before. Wait, it's not your favorite. What can we do to improve it? What's off about it? I just feel like I know this, I think it's because of the question, but like I feel ",
    "like there's not much of like a storytelling kind of like 246 00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:42.330 huda siraj: aspect to it. Like not many anecdotes, but I think it's because of the question. So 247 00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.250 huda siraj: I guess it makes sense. 248 00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.700 Okay? 249 00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:59.729 huda siraj: Cause then, like the next one, I use like a lot of storytelling, for of like the misrepresentation of like people color and AI 250 00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.779 huda siraj: but yeah. 251 00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:35.109 huda siraj: I think. Wait. Let me change. I feel like, instead of extensive and beneficial. We can do like a like efficient and hmm 252 00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:43.999 huda siraj: a enhancing. But I think beneficent is fine. I think beneficial is fine, too. Yeah. 253 00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.410 Jenny Duan: time 254 00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.990 Jenny Duan: over 255 00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.010 Jenny Duan: these applications. 256 00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.080 Jenny Duan: So can you name the social inequity that 257 00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:23.859 Jenny Duan: you are mentioning in this essay? And what the specific harm is? 258 00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.690 huda siraj: I guess, like 259 00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:41.530 huda siraj: you know, the fear that, like AI is like taking over jobs like, I think, like a lot of people are scared of, like like the lack of human specialization. And AI, and like not just a L like every single field 260 00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.120 huda siraj: like shh. 261 00:31:43.580 --> 00:32:01.160 huda siraj: for example, like art, like AI generated art, is like like stealing other people's art styles and like AI ethics. And one way it came to solve that, because, like now, if you try to generate like art styles into style of someone else. It doesn't work. 262 00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:06.099 huda siraj: so yeah, like, kind of a. 263 00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:11.959 huda siraj: it's kind of like ripping ",
    "off like human specialization. 264 00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.860 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. yeah, I think that's that's good. 265 00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.280 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel like, that's. 266 00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.949 huda siraj: I think you name it here. So I think this is fine. Yeah. 267 00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.390 Jenny Duan: yeah, this is, I feel good about this and say, if you like, I can approve it. 268 00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.020 huda siraj: Alright. 269 00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:41.300 Jenny Duan: okay. This you also 270 00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:42.820 is this finished? 271 00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.580 huda siraj: Yeah. 272 00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:49.830 huda siraj: Bunch of enters right there like this. Right? Yeah. 273 00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.730 Jenny Duan: Let me read over this one more time. 274 00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.450 Jenny Duan: Oh, by the way, are you going to Pakistan? This weekend? 275 00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:33.609 huda siraj: No, it was like it was too late, cause I was like asking my dad to like book the like flight, and like settings like and like hotel and stuff. So we weren't able to and also have, like the sharp tank project, which, if I'm absent like my English, is just gonna kill me. So yeah, that makes sense. That's okay. Next time 276 00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:42.979 Jenny Duan: the hackathons are really fun, though my sister is going and my other friends sisters are also going. So next time you should go, I think that they are usually pretty fun. 277 00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.840 huda siraj: Yeah, I think I'll probably like sign up for a different one. Yeah. 278 00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.390 Jenny Duan: cool. 279 00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.130 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 280 00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:37.650 Jenny Duan: I would also bring in. I would not maybe mention Cynthoria this one, because you already talked about Cynthia I would talk about. I think you mentioned folklift, and how like in your community already, you already advocate, f",
    "or, like diversity through the Folklift initiative and 281 00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:48.419 Jenny Duan: like, bring that in like. Don't be afraid to mention, like other clubs and organizations that you're part of, or even saying, like representing your community through the Youth Action Committee like, I think you can name drop that as well. 282 00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.310 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Yeah. 283 00:34:50.489 --> 00:35:07.609 Jenny Duan: I think I mentioned like folklore to the earlier paragraph. But like, yeah, I think this paragraph kind of talking about like AI ethics a little bit 284 00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:18.419 Jenny Duan: I think you can mentioned like the Youth Action Committee, too. That's and like maybe volunteering in the Muslim community. I think that's all like very valuable here. So I'll make a note for you to that. 285 00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:33.040 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't love this first sentence doesn't really add much to your essay. 286 00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.950 huda siraj: Yeah, I think I could definitely rewrite that 287 00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.750 huda siraj: sharing 288 00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.750 Jenny Duan: quarantine 289 00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.979 Jenny Duan: during the pandemic 290 00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:56.930 Jenny Duan: teachers can say across the United States. They're cool. 291 00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:19.019 Jenny Duan: emphasize. put in present tense. 292 00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.390 Jenny Duan: Hey? Let's change it to present tense 293 00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:38.370 Jenny Duan: I'm contributing instead of I've attempted to contribute. We change it to. I'm contributing 294 00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:42.330 Jenny Duan: with. 295 00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:59.219 Jenny Duan: oh, I think it's fine if you mentioned Thoria here, but I would also mention, like the some of the other things you are part of, because I feel like you have extra words. 296 00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, oh, no, not really. 297 00:37:02.460 ",
    "--> 00:37:07.630 huda siraj: Okay. I could cut back on this and thorium. Maybe I can. 298 00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.210 huda siraj: With my initiative. 299 00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.079 Jenny Duan: This was my first video game. 300 00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:25.869 Jenny Duan: I think if you just mentioned in Thoria, you don't have to say the rest of it, because you already have dedicated to Cyoria. So I think it's fine if you just end it here and then like, maybe 301 00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.450 Jenny Duan: beyond 302 00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:38.440 Jenny Duan: these organizations, I aim to bring my background in advancing equity through 303 00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:47.700 Jenny Duan: he.

Forward. What do you think about this sentence? 309 00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:24.899 huda siraj: Okay, so 310 00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:30.700 huda siraj: my perspectives. Volunteering at my local boss to inform my leadership. Forward. 311 00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:41.750 huda siraj: wait. II don't really understand like this part where it says took in for my leadership, for like I mean, I think that's probably because of me. But 312 00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:48.830 Jenny Duan: no, I think if you don't understand it, they don't understand it, too. To. I think it's just like to 313 00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:56.930 Jenny Duan: make you a more thoughtful leader, or to like help you improve your leadership. But I don't know what the best way to word that is. What do you think 314 00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:07.600 huda siraj: like sayi",
    "ng that you're a better leader because you can consider diverse perspectives. If that makes sense.
