I also think you need to add something specific about Northwestern like, I think you just need one or 2 sentences about what you're going to do at Northwestern. 17 00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.729 Jenny Duan: I think this last paragraph needs to look something like this. 18 00:08:51.969 --> 00:09:00.449 Jenny Duan: and you need to answer this part like, How do you see yourself engaging in Northwestern's community, either extracurricularly, culturally, etc. 19 00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.299 Jenny Duan: Do you think you could add, like maybe 2 sentences? There. 20 00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.440 huda: Yeah. 21 00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.570 Jenny Duan: Cool. 22 00:12:32.455 --> 00:12:38.784 huda: So should I for the second.

Great. 28 00:12:46.692 --> 00:12:53.350 huda: And for the second one should I focus on like a cultural aspect like Msa or South Asian Club? 29 00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.090 Jenny Duan: What about like a class. 30 00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.820 huda: Hmm. 31 00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.270 huda: nice cultural class, or like a tech ethics class, maybe. 32 00:13:20.128 --> 00:13:22.700 huda: Okay. Com. Side 3, 9, 6. 33 00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.580 huda: Does this look good? 34 00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.170 Jenny Duan: Debating ethical technology. 35 00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.250 Jenny Duan: Yes. 36 00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.410 Jenny Duan: you write out the name of this course. 37 00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.309 huda: Do I mention, like the Professor? 38 00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.810 Jenny Duan: No, no, Nina. 39 00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.550 Jenny Duan: I think this is all you need, and then we just need to cut it down. 40 00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is good. What do you think. 41 00:16:35.555 --> 00:16:36.060 huda: Yeah. 42 00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.220 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm gonna approve this, I think. 43 00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.220 Jenny Duan: Good 44 00:16:42.285 --> 00:16:49.340 Jenny Duan: while you were adding to that essay, I just looked at this painting the rock essay. I cut some things down. 45 00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.429 Jenny Duan: And I think this looks good now as well. 46 00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.240 huda: Okay. Great. 47 00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.560 Jenny Duan: Cool. 48 00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.380 Jenny Duan: Really like this. 49 00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.800 huda: Thanks. 50 00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.789 Jenny Duan: It's 2 words. 51 00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.849 Jenny Duan: Okay. 200 words. Great. 52 00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.369 Jenny Duan: Okay. I think you're ready to submit. 53 00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.310 huda: Okay. Great. 54 00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:41.229 Jenny Duan: Okay. Congratulations. This is done. These are really good. 55 00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.070 Jenny Duan: Okay, Duke. Next. 56 00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.320 huda: Yeah. 57 00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.489 Jenny Duan: Can you send that in the chat. 58 00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.920 huda: Yeah, so with the 1st one. 59 00:18:52.575 --> 00:18:58.960 huda: I'm not sure if I wrote it that. Well, but yeah, it was the wide, deep essay. 60 00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.140 Jenny Duan: One moment. 61 00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.789 Jenny Duan: Wait. You still have 50 more words left for this. 62 00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:32.019 Jenny Duan: so I would suggest you writing something, some else, some other aspects about Duke that make it stand out. You can kind of like write at the end like an exposition. Just directly. Answer the question, why, Duke, and make it more straightforward. I think some things that you're missing that you don't yet address is 63 00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.969 Jenny Duan: Duke has really good research programs. This is something to the school 64 00:20:38.970 --> 00:21:08.279 Jenny Duan: it's known, for they invest a lot in undergrad research. So that's something they emphasize a lot. Also. I think, like school spirit is a big part of Duke, especially with basketball like Duke, is more of a work, hard play, hard school. So I think you can write about how you want to contribute to like the vibrant atmosphere like the spirit you cheer at their basketball games like you'll stuff like that, I think, could be emphasized some more. So how will you fit in with the student body? And then maybe one mention of the research? 65 00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.860 Jenny Duan: I think here, like you remember, like 66 00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:21.839 Jenny Duan: Duke, stands out for its blank, or just do something that kind of answers the question more directly. And 67 00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.859 Jenny Duan: and you can you have 40 words left like 2 sentences to do that. 68 00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.800 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna look at your next essays, and then we can come back to this, and you can draft it right now. 69 00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.569 Jenny Duan: And is this response, 2, 50 words as well are all of these 2 50. 70 00:22:16.105 --> 00:22:18.300 huda: Yeah, let me just double check. 71 00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:18.890 Jenny Duan: Okay. 72 00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.690 huda: Are those the optional ones? 73 00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.060 Jenny Duan: Yes. 74 00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.869 huda: Yeah, 2, 50. 75 00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.790 Jenny Duan: Your second essay looks great. 76 00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.960 huda: Thank you. Perspective response, one. 77 00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.390 Jenny Duan: Okay, I really like what you added, I'm just thinking about how to cut it down. 10 words. 78 00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.689 huda: Maybe I can get rid of this sentence. 79 00:30:37.543 --> 00:30:40.089 Jenny Duan: I just cut it down. I think it's fine. 80 00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.210 huda: Okay. 81 00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:48.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is approved congratulations. 82 00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.750 Jenny Duan: Let me just read it one more time. 83 00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.370 Jenny Duan: What is your major at Duke. 84 00:31:13.286 --> 00:31:16.190 huda: It was interdisciplinary engineering. 85 00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.700 Jenny Duan: Okay. 86 00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.540 Jenny Duan: okay, I think it's good now. 87 00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:03.760 Jenny Duan: Great 88 00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:27.130 Jenny Duan: the next one. I think it's approved. This one. I the the intellectual experience. I think that like I thought that the card flipping wasn't creative enough, so I just changed it to like drawing pictures on a piece of paper so like you creating the cards instead of working with existing cards. 89 00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:33.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's kind of my only suggestion. But I don't know what you think about that. Or if you'd like that. 90 00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:38.719 huda: I think like it works. 91 00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:47.923 Jenny Duan: Okay, great so do you. Wanna just look through those changes and then accept any ones that you see fit and just decline. If you don't like them. 92 00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:48.770 huda: Yeah. 93 00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:26.339 huda: Then should I get rid of the sentence where I talk about like my teacher showing 94 00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.759 huda: the photo cards. 95 00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:33.899 Jenny Duan: It's fine, because it's like your teacher showed the photo cards, and then you kind of like created your own. 96 00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.400 huda: Hmm, okay. 97 00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.750 Jenny Duan: Okay, if this is 2 50 words, I think we can make this a little bit longer. 98 00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.460 huda: Yeah. 99 00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.829 Jenny Duan: I think at the end you can add just a little bit more reflection 100 00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:06.250 Jenny Duan: like, maybe, like how you will bring this to your future or like how this will impact what you do next. 101 00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.769 huda: And there's a sentence like, feel kind of 102 00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:14.730 huda: I feel like this kind of feels a little abrupt. 103 00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.530 Jenny Duan: Let me check. 104 00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.130 Jenny Duan: Maybe something about how like 105 00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:36.269 Jenny Duan: I like you watch him grow more confident in his learning or learning became fun, because that's, I think another thing is like gamified learning is fun. So. 106 00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:49.600 huda: Oh, yeah, and I can also talk about, I think in the beginning I say that he came into the classroom silent and unsure but he transformed as someone who enjoyed coming to class every day. Maybe something like that. 107 00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:58.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a good idea, or like, he began, more confident in communicating with his peers other things, too. 108 00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.769 huda: And then, what were the sentences that I had to add after this? Yeah. 109 00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:19.700 Jenny Duan: I think, just like more reflection about what you're going to do with this in the future, or like what you've learned about learning in the process. I think that in some of your other essays you've written about how like learning 110 00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:25.339 Jenny Duan: is something like, why is it important to you, or what do you hope to transform this into. 111 00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.730 huda: Hmm. 112 00:37:31.462 --> 00:37:33.640 huda: so should I say something like 113 00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:41.508 huda: like, eventually, every learner. Okay, I think I'm just like kind of saying something. But 114 00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.880 huda: Every learner must become a teacher. 115 00:37:45.647 --> 00:37:48.269 huda: Actually, I don't feel like that's necessarily true. 116 00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.590 Jenny Duan: Well, how do you think learning has impacted you at all? 117 00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:57.839 huda: I mean, like. 118 00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:11.256 huda: I think, like, well, teaching has helped me like, get a new perspective on learning, because because I'm not only someone who does teaching, but also learning at school and other 119 00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:12.940 huda: kind of 120 00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:28.649 huda: like I've I learned at school and everything. So I think, like having that dual role gained this new perspective, that like learning, has to be fun in order for me to actually like, gain something from it. 121 00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.977 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. 122 00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:40.519 Jenny Duan: I believe in leveraging my adaptability to teach others and explore and draw their own connections. Maybe say, like 123 00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:50.200 Jenny Duan: it's also like your creativity or intellect, like. 124 00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:59.150 Jenny Duan: What does that show about who you are that you haven't yet emphasized? I think here you've talked about how you develop synthoria. But I feel like 125 00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:07.339 Jenny Duan: I think you can maybe add, I think, beyond this ending you can also have the space to add a little bit about 126 00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:16.290 Jenny Duan: how you develop synthoria or why you developed synthoria. Because I feel like you're kind of glossing over that, although it is covered in your common app. 127 00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:19.940 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 128 00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:58.532 huda: Maybe I could say something like in the future I hope to continue 129 00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:09.909 huda: creating education solutions or education resources that are I guess. Tailored to everyone. 130 00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:18.410 Jenny Duan: Education. Yeah, education is universal. How does that relate to your imagination, creativity, or intellect? 131 00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.059 huda: I think, like finding creative ways. To teach is kind of my specialty. 132 00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:50.110 Jenny Duan: Maybe something like it's also empathy, like by understanding, like, I don't know if it's people's unique learning needs but understanding that everyone learns in a different way. Like, you have this fundamental belief that, like 133 00:40:50.920 --> 00:41:00.349 Jenny Duan: like learning, is universal and everyone can learn, and that there can be different tools that can benefit every person, no matter their background or their. 134 00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.910 Jenny Duan: I guess educational journey. 135 00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:58.300 Jenny Duan: think there's something like that? Obviously, this is that's like a really rough sentence. But I think 136 00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.500 Jenny Duan: something along those lines could be a foundation. 137 00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:10.849 huda: So by recognizing and maybe innovating for. 138 00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 139 00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.350 huda: Alright. 140 00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:41.260 huda: I feel like you can just go to by recognizing and innovating for diverse learning needs. I strive to continue finding creative solutions to the learning opportunities for the future. 141 00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.110 huda: So yeah. 142 00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.900 Jenny Duan: I feel like this looks really good. Let me just do one more read over. 143 00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:59.478 Jenny Duan: I think. Here. I feel like you shouldn't talk too much about what the game is, does. But you're rather your process creating the game, because I think these questions are already addressed by your personal statement. So I think here I think you should emphasize the 144 00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:05.262 Jenny Duan: creativity, imagination, and intellect a little bit more. 145 00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:21.789 Jenny Duan: so maybe like what kind of considerations did you have to take into while developing the virtual game, and like, how did you design your characters? You already addressed the characters on a little bit in your personal statement. But I think bringing that out a little bit more here would be good. 146 00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:27.579 huda: So like changing the questions. To address what topic? Again. 147 00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.529 Jenny Duan: Like your thought, process, your imagination, creativity, or intellect. 148 00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:34.240 huda: Hmm. 149 00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.456 Jenny Duan: So you could say, like 150 00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:44.860 Jenny Duan: like, what were some of the trade-offs that you made when coming up with this game to sign. 151 00:46:46.365 --> 00:46:49.640 huda: To prioritize, I guess, like that 152 00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:56.040 huda: educational aspect of like the dialogue or the stylistic choices. 153 00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.119 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So maybe, like, how do I balance? 154 00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.549 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like the pacing of the game, or 155 00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.320 Jenny Duan: just be a little bit specific. 156 00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:18.470 huda: Wait. How do I just like write it after this? Because I don't know if I don't really talk about like the development journey. I talk about the game here, so 157 00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.930 huda: would I need like a sentence before that. 158 00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.250 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 159 00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:54.230 Jenny Duan: what is one example of your creativity in synthoria? Can you add a deep? I think maybe here's the place to add the sentence. 160 00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:57.990 huda: Well. 161 00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.940 huda: I don't really know how to frame like the question. 162 00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:17.910 Jenny Duan: I don't think it needs to be a question. Couldn't say. 163 00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.599 Jenny Duan: what language did you code this in. 164 00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:25.139 huda: C sharp. 165 00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:36.290 Jenny Duan: We finish this sentence. 166 00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:34.159 huda: And would this blank be about like many games or kind of more specific than that. 167 00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.380 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe. 168 00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:41.170 Jenny Duan: Did they like mini games like, what? 169 00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.779 huda: Like sorting games. 170 00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:52.759 huda: And I guess, like, yeah, 171 00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:01.129 huda: like, you know, when you're like given 2 options. And then you kind of have, like a quiz, almost. 172 00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.659 huda: I guess the disco is a quiz. 173 00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.819 huda: maybe face moral dilemmas. 174 00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.470 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 175 00:50:47.680 --> 00:51:00.270 Jenny Duan: okay. And then I think the is there another lesson we can take away? That's not moral dilemmas, because I think moral dilemmas sounds like, not as straightforward as another type. Like another learning lesson. A player could have. 176 00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:07.199 huda: And maybe like, and classification models. 177 00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.859 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 178 00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:19.000 Jenny Duan: I think this is approved. I think your Duke essay is ready for submission congrats. 179 00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:24.730 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then what's next for you? 180 00:52:25.369 --> 00:52:33.150 huda: Georgia Tech. I'm not quite sure if I like my paragraph that I added about why Georgia Tech. But yeah. 181 00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:48.269 Jenny Duan: Can you send the link for the okay? See? 182 00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.020 huda: Yeah. 183 00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:15.380 Jenny Duan: I think you need like one sentence here. That's like Georgia tags. 184 00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:26.719 Jenny Duan: Computational media major provides an unparalleled opportunity to. 185 00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:43.049 Jenny Duan: And you just need to answer this part like, Why do you want to study your chosen major in a more like point blank way? 186 00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.139 huda: Can I just say, Media, I don't know if it 187 00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:09.709 huda: would sound odd if I repeat it right after saying like the computational media. And then I'd say that it's kind of because it's like an unparalleled opportunity to explore the intersection of technology and media. 188 00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:15.600 Jenny Duan: I think that this is given. This is given. What else is unique about this Major. 189 00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:38.919 huda: Well, I think I think, like Georgia Tech just has like a really large environment for like gamers so there's lots of opportunities to be involved in. You know, esports in like the game development, like all aspects of game development. So writing coding 190 00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:41.680 huda: art and everything. 191 00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:55.320 Jenny Duan: The Major. Let's see what they say 192 00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:25.990 Jenny Duan: over word, count. So let's just shorten it. 193 00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:22.159 huda: Okay. 2, 92 words. 194 00:58:22.438 --> 00:58:25.780 Jenny Duan: Think this looks good to me. How do you feel about this. 195 00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:40.400 huda: Yeah, I feel also the sentence. I don't know if I should just take it out. The last one says, talks about the esports community, because I feel like it kind of just looks like I just added it. There. 196 00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:42.830 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 197 00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.410 Jenny Duan: You mean thinks. 198 00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:23.649 huda: Maybe, like I can say, the convergence innovation, competition challenges me to turn ideas into media creations like the Georgia tech, gold, valorant esports tournaments. Challenge me to strategize. 199 01:00:05.646 --> 01:00:10.009 huda: Should, I say? Like the Jersey tech golds valorant esports team. 200 01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:12.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 201 01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.949 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is like grammatically sound, actually 202 01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.430 Jenny Duan: be a while like, I think it's at the same time I don't know if 203 01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.609 Jenny Duan: it's I don't know if like is the best connector. 204 01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:44.869 Jenny Duan: I think, while might be better. 205 01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:52.499 huda: I feel like, I already say, have a sentence structure. So then, and would be the best fit. 206 01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.069 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I think this looks good. How are you feeling. 207 01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:15.459 huda: Yeah, I think I feel good about this. 208 01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.160 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great sounds.

Yeah. 217 01:01:41.668 --> 01:01:46.210 huda: One sentence, so I don't think should be too much of a problem. 218 01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:47.780 Jenny Duan: Wait! What did you say? 219 01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:59.319 huda: I think. It'll it's only like a couple sentences I have, like the one sentence by Brown, and then kind of implementing brown into one of the essays. So. 220 01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:05.960 Jenny Duan: Okay, then it should be fine. I feel like, also, you're a fast writer.

Well, but yeah, it was the wide, deep essay. 60 00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.140 Jenny Duan: One moment. 61 00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.789 Jenny Duan: Wait. You still have 50 more words left for this. 62 00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:32.019 Jenny Duan: so I would suggest you writing something, some else, some other aspects about Duke that make it stand out. You can kind of like write at the end like an exposition. Just directly. Answer the question, why, Duke, and make it more straightforward. I think some things that you're missing that you don't yet address is 63 00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.969 Jenny Duan: Duke has really good research programs. This is something to the school 64 00:20:38.970 --> 00:21:08.279 Jenny Duan: it's known, for they invest a lot in undergrad research. So that's something they emphasize a lot. Also. I think, like school spirit is a big part of Duke, especially with basketball like Duke, is more of a work, hard play, hard school. So I think you can write about how you want to contribute to like the vibrant atmosphere like the spirit you cheer at their basketball games like you'll stuff like that, I think, could be emphasized some more. So how will you fit in with the student body? And then maybe one mention of the research? 65 00:21:10.390 --> 0",
    "0:21:12.860 Jenny Duan: I think here, like you remember, like 66 00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:21.839 Jenny Duan: Duke, stands out for its blank, or just do something that kind of answers the question more directly.

Perspective response, one. 77 00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.390 Jenny Duan: Okay, I really like what you added, I'm just thinking about how to cut it down. 10 words. 78 00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.689 huda: Maybe I can get rid of this sentence. 79 00:30:37.543 --> 00:30:40.089 Jenny Duan: I just cut it down. I think it's fine. 80 00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.210 huda: Okay. 81 00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:48.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is approved congratulations. 82 00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.750 Jenny Duan: Let me just read it one more time. 83 00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.370 Jenny Duan: What is your major at Duke. 84 00:31:13.286 --> 00:31:16.190 huda: It was interdisciplinary engineering. 85 00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.700 Jenny Duan: Okay. 86 00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.540 Jenny Duan: okay, I think it's good now. 87 00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:03.760 Jenny Duan: Great 88 00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:27.130 Jenny Duan: the next one. I think it's approved. This one. I the the intellectual experience. I think ",
    "that like I thought that the card flipping wasn't creative enough, so I just changed it to like drawing pictures on a piece of paper so like you creating the cards instead of working with existing cards. 89 00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:33.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's kind of my only suggestion. But I don't know what you think about that. Or if you'd like that. 90 00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:38.719 huda: I think like it works. 91 00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:47.923 Jenny Duan: Okay, great so do you. Wanna just look through those changes and then accept any ones that you see fit and just decline. If you don't like them. 92 00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:48.770 huda: Yeah. 93 00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:26.339 huda: Then should I get rid of the sentence where I talk about like my teacher showing 94 00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.759 huda: the photo cards. 95 00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:33.899 Jenny Duan: It's fine, because it's like your teacher showed the photo cards, and then you kind of like created your own. 96 00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.400 huda: Hmm, okay. 97 00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.750 Jenny Duan: Okay, if this is 2 50 words, I think we can make this a little bit longer. 98 00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.460 huda: Yeah. 99 00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.829 Jenny Duan: I think at the end you can add just a little bit more reflection 100 00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:06.250 Jenny Duan: like, maybe, like how you will bring this to your future or like how this will impact what you do next. 101 00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.769 huda: And there's a sentence like, feel kind of 102 00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:14.730 huda: I feel like this kind of feels a little abrupt. 103 00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.530 Jenny Duan: Let me check. 104 00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.130 Jenny Duan: Maybe something about how like 105 00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:36.269 Jenny Duan: I like you watch him grow more confident in his learning or learning became fun, because that's, I think another thing is like gamified learning is fun. So. 106 00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:49.",
    "600 huda: Oh, yeah, and I can also talk about, I think in the beginning I say that he came into the classroom silent and unsure but he transformed as someone who enjoyed coming to class every day. Maybe something like that. 107 00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:58.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a good idea, or like, he began, more confident in communicating with his peers other things, too. 108 00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.769 huda: And then, what were the sentences that I had to add after this? Yeah. 109 00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:19.700 Jenny Duan: I think, just like more reflection about what you're going to do with this in the future, or like what you've learned about learning in the process. I think that in some of your other essays you've written about how like learning 110 00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:25.339 Jenny Duan: is something like, why is it important to you, or what do you hope to transform this into. 111 00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.730 huda: Hmm. 112 00:37:31.462 --> 00:37:33.640 huda: so should I say something like 113 00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:41.508 huda: like, eventually, every learner. Okay, I think I'm just like kind of saying something. But 114 00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.880 huda: Every learner must become a teacher. 115 00:37:45.647 --> 00:37:48.269 huda: Actually, I don't feel like that's necessarily true. 116 00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.590 Jenny Duan: Well, how do you think learning has impacted you at all? 117 00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:57.839 huda: I mean, like. 118 00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:11.256 huda: I think, like, well, teaching has helped me like, get a new perspective on learning, because because I'm not only someone who does teaching, but also learning at school and other 119 00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:12.940 huda: kind of 120 00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:28.649 huda: like I've I learned at school and everything. So I think, like having that dual role gained this new perspective, that like learning, has to be fun in order for me to actually like, gain something from it. 121 00:38",
    ":31.170 --> 00:38:32.977 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. 122 00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:40.519 Jenny Duan: I believe in leveraging my adaptability to teach others and explore and draw their own connections. Maybe say, like 123 00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:50.200 Jenny Duan: it's also like your creativity or intellect, like. 124 00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:59.150 Jenny Duan: What does that show about who you are that you haven't yet emphasized? I think here you've talked about how you develop synthoria. But I feel like 125 00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:07.339 Jenny Duan: I think you can maybe add, I think, beyond this ending you can also have the space to add a little bit about 126 00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:16.290 Jenny Duan: how you develop synthoria or why you developed synthoria. Because I feel like you're kind of glossing over that, although it is covered in your common app. 127 00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:19.940 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 128 00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:58.532 huda: Maybe I could say something like in the future I hope to continue 129 00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:09.909 huda: creating education solutions or education resources that are I guess. Tailored to everyone. 130 00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:18.410 Jenny Duan: Education. Yeah, education is universal. How does that relate to your imagination, creativity, or intellect? 131 00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.059 huda: I think, like finding creative ways. To teach is kind of my specialty. 132 00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:50.110 Jenny Duan: Maybe something like it's also empathy, like by understanding, like, I don't know if it's people's unique learning needs but understanding that everyone learns in a different way. Like, you have this fundamental belief that, like 133 00:40:50.920 --> 00:41:00.349 Jenny Duan: like learning, is universal and everyone can learn, and that there can be different tools that can benefit every person, no matter their background or their. 134 00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.910 Jenny Duan: I guess educational journey. 135 00:41:52.500 -->",
    " 00:41:58.300 Jenny Duan: think there's something like that? Obviously, this is that's like a really rough sentence. But I think 136 00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.500 Jenny Duan: something along those lines could be a foundation. 137 00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:10.849 huda: So by recognizing and maybe innovating for. 138 00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 139 00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.350 huda: Alright. 140 00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:41.260 huda: I feel like you can just go to by recognizing and innovating for diverse learning needs. I strive to continue finding creative solutions to the learning opportunities for the future. 141 00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.110 huda: So yeah. 142 00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.900 Jenny Duan: I feel like this looks really good. Let me just do one more read over. 143 00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:59.478 Jenny Duan: I think. Here. I feel like you shouldn't talk too much about what the game is, does. But you're rather your process creating the game, because I think these questions are already addressed by your personal statement. So I think here I think you should emphasize the 144 00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:05.262 Jenny Duan: creativity, imagination, and intellect a little bit more. 145 00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:21.789 Jenny Duan: so maybe like what kind of considerations did you have to take into while developing the virtual game, and like, how did you design your characters? You already addressed the characters on a little bit in your personal statement. But I think bringing that out a little bit more here would be good. 146 00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:27.579 huda: So like changing the questions. To address what topic? Again. 147 00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.529 Jenny Duan: Like your thought, process, your imagination, creativity, or intellect. 148 00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:34.240 huda: Hmm. 149 00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.456 Jenny Duan: So you could say, like 150 00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:44.860 Jenny Duan: like, what were some of the trade-offs that you made when co",
    "ming up with this game to sign. 151 00:46:46.365 --> 00:46:49.640 huda: To prioritize, I guess, like that 152 00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:56.040 huda: educational aspect of like the dialogue or the stylistic choices. 153 00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.119 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So maybe, like, how do I balance? 154 00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.549 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like the pacing of the game, or 155 00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.320 Jenny Duan: just be a little bit specific. 156 00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:18.470 huda: Wait. How do I just like write it after this? Because I don't know if I don't really talk about like the development journey. I talk about the game here, so 157 00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.930 huda: would I need like a sentence before that. 158 00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.250 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 159 00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:54.230 Jenny Duan: what is one example of your creativity in synthoria? Can you add a deep? I think maybe here's the place to add the sentence. 160 00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:57.990 huda: Well. 161 00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.940 huda: I don't really know how to frame like the question. 162 00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:17.910 Jenny Duan: I don't think it needs to be a question. Couldn't say. 163 00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.599 Jenny Duan: what language did you code this in. 164 00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:25.139 huda: C sharp. 165 00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:36.290 Jenny Duan: We finish this sentence. 166 00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:34.159 huda: And would this blank be about like many games or kind of more specific than that. 167 00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.380 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe. 168 00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:41.170 Jenny Duan: Did they like mini games like, what? 169 00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.779 huda: Like sorting games. 170 00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:52.759 huda: And I guess, like, yeah, 171 00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:01.129 huda: like, you know, when you're like given 2 options. And then you kind of have, like a quiz, almost. 172 00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.659 huda: I guess the disco is a ",
    "quiz. 173 00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.819 huda: maybe face moral dilemmas. 174 00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.470 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 175 00:50:47.680 --> 00:51:00.270 Jenny Duan: okay. And then I think the is there another lesson we can take away? That's not moral dilemmas, because I think moral dilemmas sounds like, not as straightforward as another type. Like another learning lesson. A player could have. 176 00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:07.199 huda: And maybe like, and classification models. 177 00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.859 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 178 00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:19.000 Jenny Duan: I think this is approved. I think your Duke essay is ready for submission congrats. 179 00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:24.730 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then what's next for you? 180 00:52:25.369 --> 00:52:33.150 huda: Georgia Tech. I'm not quite sure if I like my paragraph that I added about why Georgia Tech. But yeah. 181 00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:48.269 Jenny Duan: Can you send the link for the okay? See? 182 00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.020 huda: Yeah. 183 00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:15.380 Jenny Duan: I think you need like one sentence here. That's like Georgia tags. 184 00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:26.719 Jenny Duan: Computational media major provides an unparalleled opportunity to. 185 00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:43.049 Jenny Duan: And you just need to answer this part like, Why do you want to study your chosen major in a more like point blank way? 186 00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.139 huda: Can I just say, Media, I don't know if it 187 00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:09.709 huda: would sound odd if I repeat it right after saying like the computational media. And then I'd say that it's kind of because it's like an unparalleled opportunity to explore the intersection of technology and media. 188 00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:15.600 Jenny Duan: I think that this is given. This is given. What else is unique about this Major. 189 00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:38.919 huda: Well, I think I think, like Georgia Tech just has like a really large envi",
    "ronment for like gamers so there's lots of opportunities to be involved in. You know, esports in like the game development, like all aspects of game development. So writing coding 190 00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:41.680 huda: art and everything. 191 00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:55.320 Jenny Duan: The Major. Let's see what they say 192 00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:25.990 Jenny Duan: over word, count. So let's just shorten it. 193 00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:22.159 huda: Okay. 2, 92 words. 194 00:58:22.438 --> 00:58:25.780 Jenny Duan: Think this looks good to me. How do you feel about this. 195 00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:40.400 huda: Yeah, I feel also the sentence. I don't know if I should just take it out. The last one says, talks about the esports community, because I feel like it kind of just looks like I just added it. There. 196 00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:42.830 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 197 00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.410 Jenny Duan: You mean thinks. 198 00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:23.649 huda: Maybe, like I can say, the convergence innovation, competition challenges me to turn ideas into media creations like the Georgia tech, gold, valorant esports tournaments. Challenge me to strategize. 199 01:00:05.646 --> 01:00:10.009 huda: Should, I say? Like the Jersey tech golds valorant esports team. 200 01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:12.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 201 01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.949 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is like grammatically sound, actually 202 01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.430 Jenny Duan: be a while like, I think it's at the same time I don't know if 203 01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.609 Jenny Duan: it's I don't know if like is the best connector. 204 01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:44.869 Jenny Duan: I think, while might be better. 205 01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:52.499 huda: I feel like, I already say, have a sentence structure. So then, and would be the best fit. 206 01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.069 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I think this looks good. How are you feeling. 207 01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:15.459 huda: Yeah, I think I f",

What did you say? 219 01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:59.319 huda: I think. It'll it's only like a couple sentences I have, like the one sentence by Brown, and then kind of implementing brown into one of the essays. So. 220 01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:05.960 Jenny Duan: Okay, then it should be fine. I feel like, also, you're a fast writer.
