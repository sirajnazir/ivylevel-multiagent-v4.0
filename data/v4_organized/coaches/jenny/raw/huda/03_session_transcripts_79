It's going well, how are you? 3 00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.530 Jenny Duan: Good long time. No. See how was your weekend. 4 00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:38.459 huda: It was great lot of progress in like the essays and kind of like brainstorming. And then also, yeah, I just like. I volunteered for Sunday School, so not much, I guess. 5 00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:54.589 Jenny Duan: That's awesome. Well, I love the edits that you've made to your Usc essays. I love the 1st essay change, and then I know you also change Essay 3. So maybe we can just start off by going through that. Unless is there something else that's like on your mind right now. 6 00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:13.588 huda: Yeah, I mean, like, this one's kind of brief. But I was thinking about like, I think I want to submit. Stanford this Friday. I wanna like. Also, I don't think my dad ever reviewed the essays after. But I'll I'll make sure he does that. But yeah, he also asked, like 7 00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.154 huda: like what things might like. Hold me back from getting like accepted into Stanford, I guess. Like that's like. 8 00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.769 Jenny Duan: Grades, test scores. 9 00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.395 huda: Yeah. 10 00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.270 Jenny Duan: Those are the main things. 11 00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.650 Jenny Duan: Do you feel. 12 00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.360 huda: Do you think for Stanford? Should I apply? Test optional. 13 00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.500 Jenny Duan: Your score is 1480, remind me, or I don't remember. 14 00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.210 huda: 30. 15 00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.130 Jenny Duan: What? 16 00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.280 huda: 1530, super scored. 17 00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.909 Jenny Duan: 1530 super score. What's the individual test? Scores. 18 00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.080 huda: 1480 and 1,500. 19 00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.390 Jenny Duan: Okay. 20 00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.800 Jenny Duan: I apply with a 21 00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.279 Jenny Duan: okay, if you have 1,500, right? You don't need to apply. You don't need to go test optional. 22 00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.010 huda: Okay. 23 00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.092 Jenny Duan: You should be fine on that front. 24 00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.349 Jenny Duan: let's we can just see where the 1,500 is on the benchmark. 25 00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.442 Jenny Duan: Let me open the I don't have this number on the top of my head, but I can check it right now for the common data set. 26 00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.329 huda: And does does Stanford do super scores. 27 00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.939 Jenny Duan: Let me see. 28 00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.280 Jenny Duan: they do. Super score. Yes. 29 00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.639 Jenny Duan: you do. Super score, but your individuals still matter a lot. 30 00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.160 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. 31 00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.290 Jenny Duan: let me just check the 32 00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.810 Jenny Duan: testing. 33 00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.810 Jenny Duan: 47% submitted sat scores. 34 00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.910 Jenny Duan: So for the 2023 to 2024 class. 35 00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.290 Jenny Duan: So actually, most people did not. 36 00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.023 Jenny Duan: So 37 00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.620 Jenny Duan: here's what here's what we see with their common data set. 38 00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.219 Jenny Duan: So a score of 1,500 is in the 25th percentile. 39 00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.979 Jenny Duan: So it's like, it's really low for Stanford, but it's not a badly. It's a good score. It's a good score. It's a good score, but we're just talking about Stanford right now. 40 00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.579 Jenny Duan: So 1,500 is in the 2025th percentile, 1530 is between the 25th and the 50th percentile. 41 00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.130 Jenny Duan: So 42 00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.360 Jenny Duan: your score is not great, but it's also not bad. 43 00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.729 Jenny Duan: But since your grades are slightly lower, remind me what your Gpa. Is unweighted. 44 00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:45.689 huda: Like currently 3.9 3. 45 00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.579 Jenny Duan: Yeah, since your Gpa. Is slightly lower, I don't feel like 46 00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:17.589 Jenny Duan: you're. I don't think it really makes a difference whether you submit your sat scores or not like. I think you might as well submit them, because I don't like. I don't think your sat scores like so amazing but it's also like it's it's like what a Stanford student would have like. You're not like, you're definitely definitely not like falling off the benchmark like you have a reasonable sat score for a Stanford student like you're in this like moderate range. So like, yeah, I think you should just submit your sat score. I think it's fine. 47 00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.630 huda: Okay. 48 00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.610 huda: okay, that sounds good. 49 00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.179 Jenny Duan: The grades may be a factor, sat score. And then, do you know, like, I think your letters of Recs should be fine. 50 00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:29.539 Jenny Duan: So I think your activities look great. Your essays look great. 51 00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.959 Jenny Duan: yeah, I mean. 52 00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:48.709 Jenny Duan: I think the only other concern I would have looking at your profile is you don't really have any affiliations with like national organizations. But since you have that one essay that justifies it, because, like Mountain House is a rural place like you already explained that kind of. 53 00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.449 Jenny Duan: So I don't think that that's a major concern. 54 00:04:52.234 --> 00:04:56.359 Jenny Duan: And then I think the other thing that might not be in your favor is 55 00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.343 Jenny Duan: you're you're from. The bay area like there's just 56 00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.059 Jenny Duan: a lot of applicants. But you are from a rural town so that might 57 00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:06.779 Jenny Duan: like offset. 58 00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.369 Jenny Duan: but yeah, but even but oh, go ahead. 59 00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:32.919 huda: I saw with like Usc, like you can check like who your regional counselor is, and I think, like they weren't comparing my school with like people in like the actual bay area, like like, we're kind of a little bit outside of the Bay area. So like, we're being compared to people in like the San Joaquin Valley, which are like 60 00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:50.449 huda: Tracy, and like those schools, aren't that great? And I think, like, yeah, there's not that many competitive like profiles, I think, like in that area, but like Dublin and like Pleasanton, which are like a lot more competitive. Those are considered separately, so maybe that might work in my favor. 61 00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:57.270 Jenny Duan: I think that would work in your favor like I think that you have a really strong profile that meets the expectations for Stanford, but 62 00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.680 Jenny Duan: that's that's 63 00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.059 Jenny Duan: to say that, like 64 00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:15.129 Jenny Duan: there are a lot of people who have really strong profiles, who meet the criteria to go to Stanford, so I am confident to say that you're going to get into some really good schools like you're you're going to get into Stanford Level schools. 65 00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:38.790 Jenny Duan: I, as a not as a non admissions officer cannot say that you'll get into Stanford, but I think your profile is strong enough. You'll get into like Stanford, Usc. You know one of the top top schools on your list. I think that your profile is really Stanford aligned like I think your essays are really Stanford aligned. So I think you have like a really good shot, because of the way that you've written your essays and things, but like 66 00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.630 Jenny Duan: people like can get rejected all the time, for 67 00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.020 Jenny Duan: you know, like no reason or reasons, that 68 00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:59.070 Jenny Duan: only an admissions officer would know, because, like, they only review your profile for, like less than 15 min. So I think you definitely are like, your profile demonstrates that you're a really good fit is so I think at this point it's like 69 00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.259 Jenny Duan: more. So up to like what they think at that point. 70 00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.335 huda: And so earlier, you mentioned that, like I should take ab Spanish because Stanford requires 71 00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.790 Jenny Duan: They recommend foreign language. I'll show you. 72 00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.859 huda: Do you think I should take the Ap. Exam as well. 73 00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:27.330 Jenny Duan: No, you don't have to, unless unless you actually get into Stanford, and then you want to, because then it allows you to skip classes, but like for all your Ap. Exams, like, you don't really need to take any of them 74 00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.899 Jenny Duan: unless you want to. But yes, they recommend they they recommend. 75 00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:46.760 Jenny Duan: 3, at least 3 years of foreign language. But this is recent. In the past they've recommended 4 years of foreign language, so I think they really care about like foreign language and like being a global citizen, and like thinking diversely. 76 00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.060 huda: Yeah. 77 00:07:48.502 --> 00:08:16.220 huda: also. So you know, you know, like the volunteering like the one with the English language development. I was wondering if I could mention that anywhere like maybe, like my additional information or something, because I feel like it's it's also kind of important, because like, I feel like it's also kind of connected to my story, because, like, I'm an immigrant and like I like English, wasn't my 1st language as well. So it was like, it's kind of like. 78 00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:23.109 huda: I guess, important to my profile. So I was wondering if I could like mention it anywhere. If, like you think that it's 79 00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:28.900 huda: like better if, like podcast, club, if you think that's more important, or if you think this one's more important. 80 00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:42.640 Jenny Duan: How long have you been doing this for? Because I think another thing that college admissions counselors are really conscious of is like, they know that a lot of people are going to be adding a lot of stuff to their profile, like at the end. And I know both podcast club and this are pretty recent, but. 81 00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.210 huda: Yeah. 82 00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.430 Jenny Duan: Which are you more involved in like? What do you spend more time doing? I would just put the one that you spent the most time doing. 83 00:08:49.840 --> 00:09:02.239 huda: Yeah, I think I definitely spent a lot more time, I think, like I started both of them at around the same time. So like starting of senior year. But I think like I've been more involved with the eld tutoring. 84 00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.940 Jenny Duan: Then maybe you can put y'ld tutoring. And then for podcast stuff, you can put that in with like, there's your student news or student journalism like you can just 85 00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.200 Jenny Duan: somehow. 86 00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:22.920 Jenny Duan: Let's look at I I can look at your activities list right now. Let me do that. But you can just add another bullet point that's like leader of podcast club there. And it's it's fine. If it's not the same like same exact activities. I don't really 87 00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.850 Jenny Duan: think they care that much. 88 00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.529 Jenny Duan: So here, filmmakers club, you can say this. And you can 89 00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.930 Jenny Duan: if you have, let's see. 90 00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.840 Jenny Duan: maybe you can say like filmmakers, club and podcasting club president, or you could say. 91 00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.960 Jenny Duan: maybe 92 00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.640 Jenny Duan: you can take away this independent thing 93 00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.970 Jenny Duan: if you want to and try to put these into different bullet points. 94 00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.815 huda: Oh, 95 00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.049 huda: I don't know what else it would fit. 96 00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.343 Jenny Duan: That's true. 97 00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.349 Jenny Duan: yeah, maybe your best bet would be to just put 98 00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.270 Jenny Duan: podcast club 99 00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.620 Jenny Duan: into filmmakers, club. 100 00:10:13.607 --> 00:10:24.580 huda: And and then also like, actually like, is it like normal for people to put more like activities in additional information, section or 101 00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.080 huda: is that. 102 00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:34.940 Jenny Duan: Normal. But it's also not that normal, because I think they would rather like you not just be so spread out that you only put like 1 h into everything. 103 00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.699 Jenny Duan: So I think 10 is 104 00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.270 Jenny Duan: is good enough 105 00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:50.719 Jenny Duan: because they don't cause they're gonna calculate, like, how many hours you spend on everything, and they it should come out to a reasonable number like if we, if we add these up like 8 plus 6, 14 plus 5, 19, 106 00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.719 Jenny Duan: can ignore this 2125 107 00:10:53.810 --> 00:11:02.490 Jenny Duan: can ignore this 2730, 34. So if you're spending like 34 h on, this is a reasonable number. But if it comes to like too many hours 108 00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:12.089 Jenny Duan: a week, then they will know that that's unrealistic. But they would rather you to go deeper into things that you actually are involved in, rather than to like, try to spread out too much. 109 00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.080 huda: Okay, and 110 00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.699 huda: okay. So I'll try like, putting it into 111 00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.339 huda: like, I think. 112 00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.250 Jenny Duan: This is this is not super 113 00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:33.579 Jenny Duan: consequent, like, I think this bullet point is not super consequential. So I would maybe just copy this, and just like 114 00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.080 Jenny Duan: absorb it into Filmmakers club. 115 00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.320 huda: Okay. 116 00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.600 Jenny Duan: Or I would just not mention podcast club at all. 117 00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's. 118 00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:54.340 huda: That's what I that's what I was wondering, because I feel like I don't put a lot of time into that. But at the same time it does kind of give me like a leadership position like in my profile. But like I'm not sure which one's more important. 119 00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:04.439 Jenny Duan: I think, maybe do the the language volunteering that seems more relevant to your story and your background. And I don't think that you're lacking leadership, like founder, founder, president. 120 00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:11.490 Jenny Duan: founders like Ambassador vice. You know, I think you have enough leadership. I don't think that's a 121 00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.810 Jenny Duan: I don't think that's an issue. 122 00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.030 Jenny Duan: Okay? 123 00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.290 Jenny Duan: Yeah volunteer. 124 00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.890 huda: Computer. I think so 125 00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.190 huda: do I. Do. I need metrics for this cause. I don't think there's any strong like. 126 00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.339 Jenny Duan: How many people did you support like, maybe just write like, how many people you help. 127 00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.600 huda: Yeah. 128 00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.770 huda: Well, I guess like, would they be considered international, like they like came 129 00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.320 huda: came here. But they're like all like immigrants, I guess. 130 00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that you can just write that they're immigrants. That is appropriate 131 00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:19.769 Jenny Duan: immigrants. And are they adults? Are they children? Maybe you can say more information about who you're helping and like, are they refugees like, what are their background? Like? 132 00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 133 00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.250 Jenny Duan: high schoolers, great. 134 00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:52.499 huda: Oh, actually like something that's pretty interesting is that like every Friday we like, make a game for them to like learn English in some way, like, for example, sometimes it's pictionary. Sometimes it's like like a like a photo card game. So I guess it's kind of similar to like all the other educational opportunities that I've gotten as well. 135 00:13:53.528 --> 00:13:56.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely. Maybe. 136 00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.229 Jenny Duan: What's 1 way you could summarize that in one sentence. 137 00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.870 huda: Crafted 138 00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.339 huda: language development 139 00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.300 huda: damn. 140 00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.499 Jenny Duan: Are these virtual games, paper games like, what types of games are these activities. 141 00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.810 huda: And like. 142 00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.039 huda: yeah, like our games, basically. 143 00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.110 Jenny Duan: Specify that. 144 00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.370 huda: Yeah, I think this this looks pretty good. 145 00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that looks good as well. 146 00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.280 Jenny Duan: Hello! 147 00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.640 Jenny Duan: How many characters is this? 148 00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.260 Jenny Duan: Okay? 99 perfect. You could maybe even add, like one more note. 149 00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.349 Jenny Duan: How many language development card games 150 00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.950 Jenny Duan: did any of them pass? Are you still preparing them, or, like. 151 00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:26.480 huda: Yeah, we're still preparing them. And I don't think there's a lot of games, I think, like 152 00:15:28.493 --> 00:15:32.030 huda: like, maybe even like 5. But that's not a lot. 153 00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:38.439 Jenny Duan: Pretty substantial. You could put 5. And also, are you working with a team? Who are you working with? And what is this program? Through. 154 00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:44.610 huda: Through the school, and I guess I work with some other volunteers. 155 00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:55.330 Jenny Duan: Maybe write something about how you collaborate with others? Or are you a leader like, are you? What is your role like? Are you an organizer. Are you just who's organizing this? Who's running this program? 156 00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.500 huda: It's with the English department. 157 00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.236 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! 158 00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.810 Jenny Duan: Maybe you 159 00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.899 Jenny Duan: collaborate with English Department 160 00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:17.550 Jenny Duan: and peers to prepare 36 immigrant high schoolers for the Lic. Exam. 161 00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.400 Jenny Duan: What is the Eplac Elpac? Exam. 162 00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:35.119 huda: It's like when when you move to the country like you have to like like, pass this exam to show that you can speak English and then usually like international students, also have to submit that during college applications, and like, yeah. 163 00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.039 Jenny Duan: Okay, how is? How's this bullet point? Do you think. 164 00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.760 huda: Yeah, it looks like a lot more con like, concise. Yeah, like it. 165 00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.379 huda: Do you think volunteers are better than tutor. 166 00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.329 Jenny Duan: Maybe say you can say volunteer tutor. 167 00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.439 Jenny Duan: You can just say both. 168 00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.220 Jenny Duan: alright. 169 00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:57.300 Jenny Duan: great. 170 00:16:58.164 --> 00:17:05.829 Jenny Duan: Okay. Let's go back to your Usc supplementals. Review those. Then we can get back to the Stanford one so that you're ready to submit those. 171 00:17:06.228 --> 00:17:13.380 Jenny Duan: So I saw earlier. You had 2 hooks. Did you delete the second one? Or what were your what were your thoughts here. 172 00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:36.369 huda: Yeah, basically like the the past one that I did, which was about like Tetris. I got rid of that because that one was about like educational games. And then I was trying to think of like a different hook. I didn't actually write it, but like because, like, I don't know if this really makes sense in the like context of the question, or like, if it might be too fluffy. But like, yeah, I was just like trying to think of like other ideas. But 173 00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:45.729 huda: for now I just like like stuck with how port like the game portal. It taught me about like all these random things, but it was just good. 174 00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:49.399 huda: an animate object. And so that's like the whole premise of like. 175 00:17:49.699 --> 00:17:58.719 huda: oh, it's like a random thing, but I'm learning so much from it, and then I delve into like, how I I guess, did that with my extracurriculars. 176 00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:28.509 huda: And then I talk about like specific stuff to Usc, I think. Actually, I don't know if I was approaching this correctly, but for the 1st one I talked about like my 1st choice major, which was computer science games. And then I listed like, like, similarly to the Stanford ones. I listed like a couple of places that I see myself at like at the game pipe laboratory, and then at the girls and Games club and caffeine field, all nighters for game jams, and the second one was the journalism. 177 00:18:28.878 --> 00:18:50.649 huda: Major. And then I did some research. And I saw that there's like this thing called the impact studios, where they're like, develop or like, create documentaries about local stories. And then I also kind of connected my game aspect with this one, too. So I said, interviewing like the Trojan esports team for the daily 178 00:18:50.998 --> 00:19:01.099 huda: and then there's like this one class which is also kind of related to game development. It's called like journalism, but like the VR and like. 179 00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:01.735 Jenny Duan: Hmm, 180 00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:12.609 huda: Really cool. It's like like a VR project in the class, basically. And it's like storytelling through. VR, so I think that's like very relevant to me. But yeah. 181 00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:32.270 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's really cool. So just right off the bat. I have like a couple of questions. So I don't really know how portal like this game works. And I think, as an outsider, I'm kind of unclear on how like the gameplay works between the silent, weighted cube and portal. Can you like? Just explain that to me a bit verbally. 182 00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.819 huda: Yeah, like, I think, like throughout the game, there's like, kind of 183 00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:44.320 huda: like, it's kind of hard to explain. But it's like there's like hidden lore, I guess. And then, like 184 00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.190 huda: I guess like 185 00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:55.119 huda: like, it's not directly a part of the game. It's just like revealed through like while you're playing and then, like 186 00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.239 huda: you like, learn these different themes of like loyalty, loss, and like 187 00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:05.569 huda: also kind of like comfort as well. I mean, I feel like this isn't the best example, though I feel like there's definitely more. 188 00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.780 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 189 00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.410 huda: Better ways. To show like storytelling in video games. But 190 00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.110 huda: yeah, I wanted to make it like random, like. 191 00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.989 huda: like, not knowing that 192 00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.310 huda: Video games can like actually tell stories. But. 193 00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:28.485 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if random, maybe, is like the right word. Maybe like unexpected, would be better. 194 00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.110 Jenny Duan: But I love this paragraph where it's like. 195 00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:41.989 Jenny Duan: I love this sentence. For me, games are storytelling at its in its most interactive form, tools for empathy action and change. This is phenomenal. It's 196 00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:48.260 Jenny Duan: okay. I think here, it's maybe this is not clear, like, what is what led you to discuss their impact? 197 00:20:48.973 --> 00:20:51.729 Jenny Duan: I think you can specify that like. 198 00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.189 Jenny Duan: maybe it's this ability to 199 00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:05.170 Jenny Duan: play any character or its ability to like, transform or hold any background, or like something along those lines that let me to discuss their impact. Is this, okay? 200 00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.265 Jenny Duan: But that's not where I stop. 201 00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.189 Jenny Duan: I think this transition maybe could be a little bit improved. 202 00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.549 Jenny Duan: but it's fine for now at Usc through the computer science games. Major. 203 00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.389 Jenny Duan: I oh, wait, I think right here. 204 00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.799 Jenny Duan: It's not exactly clear. How education comes in right now, because I think this is maybe left over from the previous draft. 205 00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.560 Jenny Duan: because I think. 206 00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:43.700 Jenny Duan: yeah, this beginning is more about storytelling than education. I think this one we want to emphasize like games as storytelling games as narratives, and the other one can be about education. 207 00:21:44.074 --> 00:22:12.375 Jenny Duan: Because we also, I think the other thing that we want to come through here is, how does this relate to your concurrent passion for journalism? Because these majors are a little bit different? You want to see. You want to show the admissions officer how they connect, and it's through this storytelling and this ability to like help the person, the player feel more empathy like. That's why games are so important. And I think, like you should bring that out a little bit more rather than education here. So yeah, this is great. 208 00:22:15.738 --> 00:22:18.410 Jenny Duan: maybe instead of saying 209 00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.929 Jenny Duan: my second choice, Major, you could say something like 210 00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:39.820 Jenny Duan: my passion for journalism also focuses on. I wouldn't just say like second choice, Major, because I think it just. I don't know why. This sounds a little bit crass, but like they'll know it's your second choice, Major, because you'll rank it your second choice, Major, but I don't think you need to say that you know. 211 00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.029 Jenny Duan: also focuses on exploring narratives in in a different form. 212 00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.370 Jenny Duan: Data. Journalism allows me to uncover. You use narratives twice here. 213 00:22:49.050 --> 00:23:00.430 Jenny Duan: Movie stories, narratives, hidden narratives using numbers the same way. Use game mechanics to engage and inform perfect. I see myself. So you say you use this structure. I see myself twice. Maybe you say 214 00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.370 Jenny Duan: something different here as a transition. 215 00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:12.239 huda: Yeah, I thought I thought it would be kind of a little bit like parallelism. But I think, yeah, it might not make sense. But. 216 00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.110 Jenny Duan: I think right here it comes across a little bit more as 217 00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.440 Jenny Duan: like 218 00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:24.930 Jenny Duan: rep not repetition, but not in an intentional way, because I think the 1st 2 sentences aren't parallel structure. So I think, yeah. 219 00:23:29.197 --> 00:23:32.769 huda: So should I just reword it, or something like like 220 00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.320 huda: like. 221 00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.760 huda: I mean, this is like almost the same thing. But like I can't picture myself. 222 00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.300 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly like exactly. Just instead of see. Just like I visualize, I can picture myself like something 223 00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.660 Jenny Duan: or say at Usc, you'll find me 224 00:23:53.740 --> 00:24:01.590 Jenny Duan: you'd find me, or something. That's another way to say it. I don't know whatever you prefer. I don't think the semantics matter too much. It's just something different. 225 00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.300 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like you would find me, or you could find me. 226 00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.370 huda: This Wilson. 227 00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.900 Jenny Duan: You'll find me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 228 00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.560 Jenny Duan: yeah. That's fine. 229 00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.060 huda: Okay, also. So like this hook, like, I should change it completely. Right. 230 00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:49.420 Jenny Duan: I think so. I I think it's just unclear like I think you would need more context to explain what Portal is, and I'm not sure, like 231 00:24:49.450 --> 00:25:00.910 Jenny Duan: Portal is not a narrative like I think you should start with a narrative like maybe you can say, like playing this character. I became this I like learned about a background completely different from my own. Or I learned about this 232 00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.110 Jenny Duan: person's story which related to 233 00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:13.890 Jenny Duan: some aspect maybe you could turn it into like this character story is similar to like one that you wrote about for folklift or another narrative that you read in the news, or something like that, they can immediately connect it to storytelling. 234 00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.150 Jenny Duan: If there's any characters that come up, if not like. 235 00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.710 Jenny Duan: we can find a game that has one. 236 00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:41.079 huda: Well, okay, this one, this, the game itself is not really known, but like one of my favorite games, mutazion, like, there's like a character. She's like a chef and she has like this, like 237 00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:55.690 huda: story about like how like she moved to this island. And then, like she makes like this food and like her restaurant and everything. And I think it's kind of similar to like some of like the catering small businesses that I wrote about in folklift. 238 00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.380 Jenny Duan: That's great. Yeah. 239 00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.009 Jenny Duan: I would. Definitely, I think that's like, I think that's great. 240 00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.240 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 241 00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.500 huda: And then 242 00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.760 huda: let me just like remember what the name is. 243 00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.190 Jenny Duan: Great. 244 00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.610 huda: Wait. How do I like? How do I bring up the game without like cause like then I feel like 245 00:26:49.800 --> 00:27:02.319 huda: I don't know if I have to give a lot of context as to what the game is to, and then like quickly, just like abruptly, like transition into folklift, like, I'm a bit confused on how to start it. 246 00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:09.380 Jenny Duan: I would say, Okay, can you tell me about the game in your words? 247 00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.660 Jenny Duan: So you've already given me some context like, it's this cooking game like. Tell me, tell me more. 248 00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:32.960 huda: Yeah, basically, like in the game. They're like, some of the characters are like mutants. And then the other ones are like humans, and then so like the character that I'm talking about. She's like a mutant and she lives on this island, and she has like a restaurant 249 00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:48.930 huda: and then, like, I guess she like started that like restaurants like support, like the people of the island, because there's like, not that many people there. And it's kind of like, the whole game is kind of like a soap opera, basically and like. 250 00:27:49.732 --> 00:28:00.710 huda: yeah. So she started to support her like the people on her island, which actually, now that I'm thinking about it, it's like really similar to like these people that started like 251 00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.260 huda: their own 252 00:28:02.967 --> 00:28:08.339 huda: like, I guess, small businesses to support our small town. But yeah. 253 00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.839 Jenny Duan: Okay. So maybe you can say, like 254 00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.060 Jenny Duan: in 255 00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.160 Jenny Duan: in the game's name you can just say here, like 256 00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.080 Jenny Duan: in Mutazion, I I 257 00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.779 Jenny Duan: I play as blank. 258 00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.430 Jenny Duan: spending hours 259 00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.839 Jenny Duan: blank like cooking, you know, and whatever the character does. 260 00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.990 Jenny Duan: I play as the character's name comma like a mutant something, you know. 261 00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.889 Jenny Duan: I don't know how you would describe what she does 262 00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:51.259 Jenny Duan: a mutant chef like crafting recipes to feed her time or like I don't. I don't exactly know what the. 263 00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.170 huda: I don't know if that's necessary. 264 00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:30.049 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then maybe you can just change. Can I delete this really quick? This sentence, okay. 265 00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.050 Jenny Duan: for the people of her small island at her restaurant. 266 00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.659 Jenny Duan: I think the restaurant is implied. Maybe you can. Just 267 00:29:40.621 --> 00:29:44.270 Jenny Duan: okay, let me just look at how many words you have. 268 00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.040 Jenny Duan: Okay, is this 2 50 words total. 269 00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.190 huda: Yes. 270 00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.053 Jenny Duan: Okay, maybe 271 00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.760 Jenny Duan: for this question like. 272 00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.409 Jenny Duan: who knew that? 273 00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.809 Jenny Duan: I don't know. I don't know if if we should start with a question, or if we should just start with 274 00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.890 Jenny Duan: this. 275 00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:08.237 huda: It could be like who knew a green mutant? Can 276 00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:14.170 huda: like encourage me to like, empathize with my own town, or something like that. 277 00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.020 huda: someone or like I don't know like that's not the exact wording, but like maybe some. 278 00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.339 Jenny Duan: Who knew that a green alien mutant 279 00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.010 Jenny Duan: could share 280 00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:35.630 Jenny Duan: such a similar story to people from like I don't know something like that. We could start with that, we can start with that and edit it. Okay. 281 00:30:54.430 --> 00:31:02.719 Jenny Duan: can you write one more sentence about like interviewing someone, for like, did you interview someone for folklift? Or did you do anything that relates to these types of stories? 282 00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:06.544 huda: Yeah, I interviewed this 283 00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.260 huda: woman she like makes for 284 00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.279 huda: actually, yeah. This woman she makes Biryani, or she's like. 285 00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.120 Jenny Duan: I remember this. 286 00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.120 Jenny Duan: can you add one sentence about what what she does like just here 287 00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.250 Jenny Duan: say in Mount House, or. 288 00:31:26.193 --> 00:31:27.440 huda: At home. 289 00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.540 huda: bye. 290 00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.490 huda: or at 291 00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.680 huda: at my hometown. 292 00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.710 Jenny Duan: Maybe that sentence would go right here. Do you see, like, before, the word data you can say, like 293 00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:45.064 Jenny Duan: also exploring exploring stories just in a different form. Maybe you can say like at home. 294 00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:54.339 Jenny Duan: I interviewed, and then you can talk about how like her story is similar to Maurice. So that way you can have that continuity throughout the essay. 295 00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.440 huda: Oh, I see! 296 00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.949 Jenny Duan: Wait. Let me just look at some places to shorten this. 297 00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:32.380 huda: Also, actually, I'm kind of worried that this might be repetitive to like, I think, essay number 2, which is the one about like, what do you add to 298 00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:39.180 huda: the Turby cause? I remember I kind of mentioned about like how some housewives turned entrepreneurs 299 00:32:39.758 --> 00:32:41.630 huda: and they also sell. 300 00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:45.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you're right. 301 00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.690 Jenny Duan: Okay, is there another story, another character that is similar. 302 00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.979 Jenny Duan: I think you, I think you just need to write about a character story, maybe just like from a different lens. 303 00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:14.450 huda: I feel like I don't know, like any other like characters that 304 00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.019 huda: relate to like someone I've interviewed as well, but like. 305 00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:25.209 Jenny Duan: It doesn't have to be a character you interviewed just like a story that was different than your own, or shared something new to you. 306 00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:26.975 huda: Oh, 307 00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:37.650 huda: I guess, like one important 1. 1 was like that one game that I told you about earlier, about like where there's like a detective rocket. 308 00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.790 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, what did? But I think you already mentioned that in your common app, do you. 309 00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.249 huda: Oh, you're right. 310 00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:45.800 huda: Yeah. 311 00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.160 huda: maybe like someone also from this game. 312 00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:16.000 huda: wait. So like, wait. What? What am I trying to like? I guess like 313 00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.259 huda: stay in the hook. 314 00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:28.370 Jenny Duan: I think you're just trying to show that like games have exposed you to different stories or new stories, or you've learned like about a new experience in the context of games. 315 00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:40.249 Jenny Duan: Cause I think the thing with Portal, the issue with portals. It's too abstract like. It's not a person you're not adopting like a person story. You're connecting with an object, at least to my understanding and correct me if that's wrong. 316 00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:41.859 Jenny Duan: But 317 00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.520 Jenny Duan: I think it's just about like showing the more human aspect of storytelling through games. 318 00:34:49.719 --> 00:35:11.029 huda: Maybe, like I think I could. Maybe I could still use use Maury like the the chef. Maybe like maybe I don't have to connect it to like the person I interviewed for folklift. But like I think she did like this character did give me like a different perspective, because I guess this is like 319 00:35:13.969 --> 00:35:23.029 huda: I mean, like, I guess she has, like a lot of responsibility, like, you know, trying to like help out her town. And maybe that's like that's also kind of inspired me. Maybe. 320 00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.860 Jenny Duan: Got it. 321 00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.173 Jenny Duan: Okay? 322 00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.570 Jenny Duan: oh. 323 00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.470 Jenny Duan: let's see 324 00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.309 Jenny Duan: who knew that a green alien mutant could share 325 00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:50.694 Jenny Duan: could 326 00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.355 Jenny Duan: maybe, instead of share similar stories to people from in town, you could say like could 327 00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.640 Jenny Duan: inspire me to 328 00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.780 Jenny Duan: like 329 00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.860 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 330 00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.699 Jenny Duan: volunteered in for me to like become more service oriented, could 331 00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.480 Jenny Duan: teach me the value of hard work, like what has this character shown you, or what have you learned from them? 332 00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:16.045 huda: I guess, like community volunteering. And like, 333 00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:25.679 huda: yeah, I guess just like volunteering to help out in in like the to support a small community in specific. 334 00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:30.149 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Why don't you write that in? Who knew that a green alien mutant could 335 00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:37.479 Jenny Duan: inspire? Is it inspire? I think that's cliche. Inspire me to volunteer in my community. Good. 336 00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.170 huda: Maybe I could do like 337 00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.159 huda: something that like 338 00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:47.729 huda: that, like someone reading it would be like, kind of confused. So like, maybe 339 00:36:48.203 --> 00:36:50.270 huda: are not confused, but like 340 00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.419 huda: like intrigued, I guess, like 341 00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.910 huda: like a specific example of me volunteering. Maybe. 342 00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:03.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what's 1?

Or you just emphasize like, what about Maury? Are like? Why are you guys similar. 357 00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:12.890 huda: Hmm. 358 00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.610 huda: hmm. 359 00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.290 Jenny Duan: Okay, but this but support others in my community is a bit. 360 00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.610 Jenny Duan: It's a bit bit vague. 361 00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.730 Jenny Duan: So let's make that more specific. 362 00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:49.350 Jenny Duan: I experience a sense of responsibility towards my community. I have a passion for the well-being of my community. I 363 00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.279 Jenny Duan: I don't know something a little bit more specific. 364 00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.240 Jenny Duan: Okay? 365 00:38:55.570 --> 00:39:05.629 huda: I won't see she has the educational she likes has a desire for educational well-being, but I feel like that would have been a good one or Yeah, no. But then that kind of like goes back into the educational 366 00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.350 Jenny Duan: This is also a little too much, but I don't exactly know something like that. 367 00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:24.199 Jenny Duan: Like Maury, I experience a sense of responsibility. I share a commitment to the stewardship of my community. 368 00:39:24.763 --> 00:39:27.940 Jenny Duan: To the well-being of my community, maybe 369 00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.520 Jenny Duan: to the 370 00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.550 Jenny Duan: prosperity like something like that. 371 00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.229 huda: And and then like the scent.

Edit later. 377 00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.359 huda: Okay, yeah. I was trying to find a synonym for volunteering. But. 378 00:41:02.615 --> 00:41:06.440 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like I learned the importance of leveraging our 379 00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.180 Jenny Duan: passions strengths 380 00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.790 Jenny Duan: for 381 00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.280 Jenny Duan: shit 382 00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:23.180 Jenny Duan: like. I think it's about like leveraging your passion for the betterment of others. But I need a succinct way to say that 383 00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:32.269 Jenny Duan: it's like using your passions to help other people like using your skills to to make an impact. 384 00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.350 huda: I saved my community twice. 385 00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.719 Jenny Duan: Leveraging passions 386 00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.310 Jenny Duan: towards my passion 387 00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.940 Jenny Duan: record 388 00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.820 Jenny Duan: to improve 389 00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:25.099 Jenny Duan: where it's public good. 390 00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.269 Jenny Duan: It's too vague. 391 00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.305 huda: Yeah, 392 00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.020 huda: see? 393 00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.049 huda: Like, okay, I think another thing. 394 00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:43.190 huda: I'm I don't know if, like, this is really relevant. But also like, maybe I can focus. 395 00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:51.620 huda: And so like for public good, you focus on like even how I like a small community. And she has, like a small little island. So like 396 00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:56.529 huda: like a small change in a small island, can like make the biggest of differences. 397 00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 398 00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.929 huda: I learned that even even the smallest. 399 00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.076 Jenny Duan: I wanna say, your impacts are small because they're not 400 00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:22.650 Jenny Duan: like, how do we say like that? Even small changes can create big impact. But your impact. But your impact's not small, like you have big impact. So you don't wanna lose that. 401 00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.080 huda: Yeah. 402 00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:40.130 huda: Or maybe even an individual like even one individual can like have a large impact rather than like small changes like, it's like talking about how she's like one person in the island, and like one person in my town, I guess. 403 00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.269 Jenny Duan: Can you write that down 404 00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.550 Jenny Duan: and transforming community 405 00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.790 Jenny Duan: can transform the prosperity of an entire community can transform 406 00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.680 Jenny Duan: can transform. 407 00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 408 00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.650 Jenny Duan: okay, can I just gonna say, impact. 409 00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:34.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 410 00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:40.599 Jenny Duan: okay, I think this is good 411 00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.239 Jenny Duan: 2, 74. 412 00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.980 huda: And this part like 413 00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:55.350 huda: Well, like I can't really think of like a better transition could probably be like 414 00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.140 huda: cause it's like hard to like. Weave it in, I guess. 415 00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.330 Jenny Duan: What if you just took this out? 416 00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.600 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine. 417 00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:07.080 Jenny Duan: You do. 418 00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.490 Jenny Duan: Okay? 419 00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.039 huda: And I'd have to change this. I think 420 00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.219 huda: this 1st sentence here. 421 00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.170 Jenny Duan: So let me see, let me see. 422 00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:35.909 huda: Yeah, I feel like it's it doesn't really fit in the sentence and the paragraph, I mean. 423 00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe you just take it home. 424 00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:39.760 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 425 00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.667 Jenny Duan: And maybe say this 426 00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.750 Jenny Duan: at Usc. 427 00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.569 Jenny Duan: think that's probably fine. 428 00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:50.169 Jenny Duan: Okay, you have 25 words left. If you want to add in. 429 00:45:52.233 --> 00:45:56.969 huda: Should I add one more example of something I I could do as a computer science games. Major. 430 00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.990 Jenny Duan: I think so too. 431 00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.389 huda: Yeah, cause I feel like the journalism. One is a bit larger. 432 00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:10.240 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, add one more sentence. And then I think this essay is like good. After that, I I think it's much much improved 433 00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.760 Jenny Duan: than earlier drafts. 434 00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:17.359 Jenny Duan: so I'd say, like tentative approval on this essay. I feel like it's quite good now. 435 00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.906 huda: Alright! Great 436 00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:21.970 Jenny Duan: Okay? 437 00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.510 Jenny Duan: yeah. 438 00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.619 Jenny Duan: Let's look at the question. 439 00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.120 Jenny Duan: 3. Now. 440 00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:42.419 Jenny Duan: this is good. This is really good. And I like how you put this like. I think this essay fits a lot better with Question 2 441 00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.099 Jenny Duan: than the earlier one. What do you like? How do you feel about this. 442 00:46:46.580 --> 00:47:01.869 huda: Yeah, I like, okay, so I had a couple of doubts. So this street, I like by doing some research to make sure that, like Usc students like know that this this is iconic. And I I think so like, I'm not completely sure if, like 443 00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:15.349 huda: it's super well known. And then another thing is like over here, and I think it's also in the Stanford essay. It's like limited food access. It might sound like we just like. Don't have food at all like it. Just like sounds like. 444 00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.320 Jenny Duan: That's a food desert, is it? Or not? I don't know. 445 00:47:19.395 --> 00:47:40.439 huda: I don't really know like what classifies. I think like now, it's not because there's a lot of restaurants and like grocery stores like they're coming in. But like at the time of like freshman year through, like, almost like most of the developments are now so like we didn't have access to those things before, but I don't know if I'd call it a food desert. I guess. 446 00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.120 Jenny Duan: Alright. It's not a food desert. I just looked 447 00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.440 Jenny Duan: like. 448 00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:08.909 huda: I don't know, like maybe, like in an in like less vague words like lack of like 449 00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.120 huda: resources, and like like lack of 450 00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.390 huda: hmm. 451 00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.739 Jenny Duan: You can also just take this out and just say this. 452 00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.180 huda: Okay. 453 00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.051 Jenny Duan: I think maybe that's like, just. 454 00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.179 huda: Yeah, I think better. And I think I'll change that for the Stanford essays as well. 455 00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.270 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. 456 00:48:55.830 --> 00:49:01.530 Jenny Duan: I think this is too much of a telling statement. I think this is fine, but I get this. 457 00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:02.740 Jenny Duan: Oh. 458 00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:12.600 huda: Yeah, okay, so I'm like, actually, I was pretty torn about this because, I would wanna like mention that, like 459 00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:18.637 huda: the story about like not having resources like an example of me being an improvising innovator. 460 00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.520 huda: but like, I don't know if, like 3 stories is way too much. 461 00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.739 Jenny Duan: No, I don't think so. I think that is good. 462 00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.359 Jenny Duan: I think I think this makes sense. 463 00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:33.460 huda: Okay. 464 00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:40.663 Jenny Duan: I I don't think you need to include the sentence, because it's a bit of a showing sentence, a telling sentence. When you already show this throughout. 465 00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:42.670 Jenny Duan: yeah. 466 00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.160 huda: This this one. 467 00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:49.710 Jenny Duan: No, this. This is what shaped me to become an improvising innovator. 468 00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:50.750 huda: Okay. 469 00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:58.390 Jenny Duan: If you want, maybe you can say this is who I am an improvising innovator. You can say this is who I am. If you don't want to say this is who I'll be at Usc. 470 00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.049 huda: Yeah, I think I think it all makes more sense. 471 00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.359 Jenny Duan: Okay. 472 00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.719 Jenny Duan: yeah. And I think the rest of this looks good. 473 00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:20.150 huda: Let me see. 474 00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:27.060 huda: Oh, this is 3 38 words, and it's supposed to be 2 50. So I think. 475 00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.939 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's cut it down. Let's cut it down. 476 00:50:31.745 --> 00:50:32.410 Jenny Duan: fair. 477 00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.820 Jenny Duan: Well, most people drive past 478 00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.660 Jenny Duan: Manhat's California. Okay, I'll just take this 479 00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.190 Jenny Duan: among this 480 00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.950 Jenny Duan: smell of manure and power and frequent power outages 481 00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.300 Jenny Duan: the self-sustaining community. 482 00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.750 Jenny Duan: Hey, Tyler. 483 00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:51.470 Jenny Duan: I quickly learned that 484 00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.750 Jenny Duan: Swissip. 485 00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.840 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm just gonna delete this 486 00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.080 Jenny Duan: exactly. 487 00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:21.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 488 00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.789 huda: I don't know if it's necessary. 489 00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:50.770 Jenny Duan: And instead of table, is there like a funny Usc reference? We could say like, I don't. I don't know. If, like at Stanford, we could say like, I'll bring this this spirit to the to the quad, or like to the oval or something. But I don't know about Usc. 490 00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.280 huda: And 491 00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:43.979 huda: I'm not sure I don't think so. 492 00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.039 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! That's fine. 493 00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:02.930 Jenny Duan: 2, 65. Okay. 494 00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.589 Jenny Duan: I think. Hello, me is. 495 00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.200 Jenny Duan: it's fine. Here. 496 00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.480 huda: Okay? Cause I I already kind of like mentioned, like Indian Muslim girls. So I 497 00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:40.640 huda: don't know if, like, I'll just 498 00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.039 huda: kind of removing that for word count, but. 499 00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.720 Jenny Duan: Okay. 500 00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:42.940 Jenny Duan: 54. Forwards. 501 00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:48.162 huda: Also like, Okay. 502 00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:26.890 huda: I'm not sure. Let me check if if Usc also has, like the P sets like kind of like term 503 00:55:27.179 --> 00:55:31.490 huda: cause. Then over here it's the same like complex machine learning challenges. I could say, like 504 00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.740 huda: tough P sets, or something like that. 505 00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:47.559 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is fine. I think I think I already took out all the over 2 50 words. Now you want to check it. 506 00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:49.290 huda: Okay. 507 00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.630 Jenny Duan: You give it a 1 over. 508 00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.169 huda: Okay, yeah, that looks good. Do you think? Do you think this is big? 509 00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.490 Jenny Duan: Where. 510 00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.440 huda: Navigating a complex machine. Learning challenges. 511 00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.020 Jenny Duan: Whether it's maybe say, like 512 00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:52.699 Jenny Duan: reference, a specific class at Usc, like whether it's solving Cs. Stanford, Cs 224 psets, or something else like. 513 00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:58.550 Jenny Duan: I think, just put a specific Usc class code there. 514 00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:07.399 Jenny Duan: Oh, you can do that in your own time. I'm gonna move on to the next essay given that we have limited time. 515 00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:15.129 Jenny Duan: I love this essay. When I was reading it I felt it felt a lot more personal, and I think it clearly distinguishes itself from essay one 516 00:57:15.509 --> 00:57:19.020 Jenny Duan: I would not say mental disabilities, I would maybe say like 517 00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.119 Jenny Duan: I don't know what the correct word is. 518 00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.779 huda: Like impairments. 519 00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.590 Jenny Duan: I don't know if Adhd is considered like 520 00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.990 Jenny Duan: a disability. 521 00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:32.050 huda: It's a disorder, I think. 522 00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.730 Jenny Duan: Wouldn't describe it as it does. Such a negative connotation. 523 00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:53.790 huda: Maybe like, instead of just saying like mental disorders, I I think they fall under the umbrella of like neurodiversity. 524 00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:56.870 Jenny Duan: Yeah, my neurodivergent relatives with Adhd. 525 00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.830 Jenny Duan: yeah. 526 00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.660 Jenny Duan: often struggle to learn through lectures, but thrive when learning is 527 00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:23.409 Jenny Duan: alright. I think this essay, this beginning of this sentence is a little cliche, so I would fix this. 528 00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:24.520 Jenny Duan: Let's come back. 529 00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:37.869 Jenny Duan: I don't know if you necessarily need folklot here. 530 00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:43.850 huda: Yeah, I think it's because earlier, I hadn't mentioned it in any of the other paragraphs or essays. 531 00:58:44.367 --> 00:58:51.309 Jenny Duan: Do you mention it anywhere else? Because it seems like this is also just like essay one in a different form, because you're still referencing journalism. 532 00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:59.120 huda: Yeah, I don't think I need it. Actually, I think I slightly mentioned it in this, the essay before 533 00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.190 huda: the 534 00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.270 huda: like, the diversity essay, I think, yeah. 535 00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:04.930 huda: So I could 536 00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:07.390 huda: possibly like, get rid of that one. 537 00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:10.050 Jenny Duan: Let's get rid of it. Where do you mention it? Here. 538 00:59:10.925 --> 00:59:13.530 huda: Here when it's like the thing about like 539 00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:17.690 huda: coding websites for housewives turned entrepreneurs. 540 00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.350 huda: And I think I 541 00:59:20.157 --> 00:59:23.509 huda: actually, I don't mention in the 1st one. But yeah, in this one. 542 00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:36.819 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! Maybe, instead of writing so much about Usc here, just add a mention for folk lift here. 543 00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:42.719 Jenny Duan: Do you think you do you think that fits, or do you think that would not work well here. 544 00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.880 huda: Here. 545 00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.729 Jenny Duan: In the 1st essay. 546 00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:46.830 Jenny Duan: both 547 00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:50.719 Jenny Duan: in when you write my passion for journalism in this paragraph, like, could you just 548 00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:55.889 Jenny Duan: write a little bit less about Usc. And then add something about folklift, just like a mention. 549 01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.620 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can see it 550 01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:07.919 Jenny Duan: through through. Like my experience in folklift. I discovered that data journalism, something like that. 551 01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.380 huda: Okay, actually, I don't know if I want to highlight. 552 01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:20.430 huda: I don't know if I want to highlight data journalism, because I don't know if my profile has enough like for that 553 01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:25.449 huda: and so maybe I could like replace a sentence to talk about folk live. 554 01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:32.079 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's what I would do. Okay? Then I would cut it out of here, because I think this is a little distracting. I don't think this. 555 01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:37.909 Jenny Duan: So this little paragraph here in Essay 3 makes sense in the context of the entire essay. 556 01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:41.399 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I would delete this. 557 01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.750 Jenny Duan: Okay. 558 01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:45.509 huda: I'm just gonna delete it. 559 01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.080 huda: Hmm. 560 01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.930 Jenny Duan: Can you start this off? And then, with your extra word, Count, can you start this off with a more compelling example? 561 01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:09.890 Jenny Duan: Because I feel like you're starting off with a generalization which is fine because this is true. But like, we want to know why this matters to you like. Obviously, you have neurodivergent relatives. That's important. But like, I'm still not seeing 562 01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:20.040 Jenny Duan: like, why this matters to you so much, and how you found out like, why, this is an issue that you want to solve versus other issues, or why? Why like you care so much about this. 563 01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.700 huda: Yeah, I think I I can start it off with 564 01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:25.506 huda: something a little more. 565 01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.680 huda: personal, I guess. 566 01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.859 huda: And then 567 01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.420 huda: as for this like wording. 568 01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.550 Jenny Duan: Like, maybe say, like through through game, like 569 01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.379 Jenny Duan: through games or like games, become a way to. 570 01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:51.230 huda: Yeah. 571 01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:55.289 Jenny Duan: Where, like through puzzles or through something, games become a way to interact. 572 01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:03.770 huda: I think this is a continuation of like the part where I'm talking about Synthoria. So like 573 01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400 huda: through. 574 01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:16.720 Jenny Duan: Like, I think you use this type of sentence structure quite frequently, like here, too, it's the same sentence structure, these challenges about more than improving education. It's about making sure, like you don't have to say 575 01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.789 Jenny Duan: this part. You can just say this challenge 576 01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.040 Jenny Duan: reinforces that learning environments, or 577 01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:26.959 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need the sentence actually at all. 578 01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:31.910 huda: Okay. 579 01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.890 Jenny Duan: Or maybe, like personalized learning ensures that 580 01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:40.200 Jenny Duan: learning environments meet everyone where they are. They are the key to ensuring that 581 01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.850 Jenny Duan: I think these 2 sentences are repetitive, so I think you can keep one of them. 582 01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.520 huda: Okay. 583 01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.220 Jenny Duan: And 584 01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:53.649 Jenny Duan: the solutions I create. This is broad, but you can say something like through synthoria and beyond, or like connected back to what you do. 585 01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.139 huda: Yeah, I like synthra and beyond. 586 01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:00.750 huda: okay. 587 01:03:02.097 --> 01:03:05.370 Jenny Duan: I think these 2 sentences are the same. What do you? 588 01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.580 Jenny Duan: So you can delete one of them. Yeah. 589 01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.220 huda: I like the bottom of the letter. 590 01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:15.590 Jenny Duan: So now you have more room to to start with. A better intro like better beginning. If that's okay. 591 01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.639 Jenny Duan: you have about 1 50 work or one. 592 01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.829 Jenny Duan: How many words do you have? 1, 25 around that? 593 01:03:24.266 --> 01:03:27.200 Jenny Duan: So I would put that in the beginning. 594 01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.590 huda: Does this make sense through these? 595 01:03:35.661 --> 01:03:39.319 huda: Like, I don't know how to like word this, but like through these. 596 01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:47.789 huda: I think that doesn't make sense cause. I'm trying to continue over from what I'm talking about through how I'm teaching like AI ethics through playful many games. 597 01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.269 Jenny Duan: Like through personalized quests. 598 01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.440 Jenny Duan: you know, get like personalized quests. 599 01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:58.269 Jenny Duan: What are some other features of interactive learning. 600 01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.450 Jenny Duan: interactive challenges? 601 01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:02.180 Jenny Duan: And 602 01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:03.379 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 603 01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.290 huda: and. 604 01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.949 Jenny Duan: I guess I don't know. 605 01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:18.990 huda: Oh, yeah. 606 01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.240 Jenny Duan: Something like like something like that, like the key components of gamified learning. 607 01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:28.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, and I think you have enough room now to write your beginning. 608 01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.760 Jenny Duan: and then you should be good. 609 01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.870 huda: So should I still keep this this part. 610 01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.500 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's still fine. 611 01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:37.649 Jenny Duan: You can also talk about. 612 01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:40.050 Jenny Duan: I mean, you kind of 613 01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:41.510 Jenny Duan: hmm. 614 01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:45.789 Jenny Duan: No, you don't. You can talk about eld here you can talk about like 615 01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.500 Jenny Duan: how you design games for Eld. Maybe that would be like a good beginning, too. 616 01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:53.470 huda: Okay, yeah, that that sounds good. 617 01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:57.319 Jenny Duan: Because then you can write about Yaeld and Synthoria. In this essay. 618 01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.670 huda: Hmm. 619 01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:05.449 Jenny Duan: Like. I mean, I'm sure, with Eld, you, you meet students from like all different backgrounds, right or different types of students. 620 01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:08.640 Jenny Duan: So that would connect that would like seamlessly transition to this. 621 01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:12.488 huda: Yeah, I like that. Actually, 622 01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:14.230 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna write. 623 01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:17.640 Jenny Duan: Okay. 624 01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:25.189 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel a lot better about these essays. I think once you make these changes, they should be good. 625 01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.560 Jenny Duan: And then once you're done writing them. 626 01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.869 Jenny Duan: just ping me, and I can take a look at them, too. 627 01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:39.370 Jenny Duan: I'll look at your Stanford essays tonight so that I'm able to give you some feedback on that before you send them to your dad again. 628 01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:54.169 huda: Okay, actually like, I think I don't think much has changed since the last time finalized them. So just like, I'll try to see if my can, if my dad can like look at it before tonight, and then with his comments like, maybe 629 01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:55.780 huda: I can let you know. 630 01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:08.459 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that sounds good. I remember your Stanford essays are like final. I think they look really good. I'm not concerned, but I think it does help to have fresh eyes. So if your dad could read them, if you want your mom or your sister or anyone else to read them 631 01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:13.190 Jenny Duan: like they might be able to pick up things that we haven't noticed, because we've been looking at it for so long. 632 01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.969 huda: Yeah. Okay. Great. 633 01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:21.059 Jenny Duan: I'm so proud of your progress. I can't believe that you're about to submit your Stanfor, Stanford. Rea. 634 01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:28.510 Jenny Duan: Okay, and good luck you're gonna go to somewhere. Amazing. So don't worry. But 635 01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:42.769 Jenny Duan: at the end of the day you'll end up like it's a you choose a school that you think fits you. They choose where they think you'll be the happiest. So you've done what you can. You know, you are an amazing student. Just breathe. It's okay. 636 01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:44.620 Jenny Duan: Okay. 637 01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.750 huda: Thank you so much. 638 01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:50.229 Jenny Duan: Yeah, see ya, and text me if you need anything.

It's going well, how are you? 3 00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.530 Jenny Duan: Good long time. No. See how was your weekend. 4 00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:38.459 huda: It was great lot of progress in like the essays and kind of like brainstorming. And then also, yeah, I just like. I volunteered for Sunday School, so not much, I guess. 5 00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:54.589 Jenny Duan: That's awesome. Well, I love the edits that you've made to your Usc essays. I love the 1st essay change, and then I know you also change Essay 3. So maybe we can just start off by going through that. Unless is there something else that's like on your mind right now. 6 00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:13.588 huda: Yeah, I mean, like, this one's kind of brief. But I was thinking about like, I think I want to submit. Stanford this Friday. I wanna like. Also, I don't think my dad ever reviewed the essays after. But I'll I'll make sure he does that. But yeah, he also asked, like 7 00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.154 huda: like what things might like. Hold me back from getting like accepted into Stanford, I guess. Like that's like. 8 00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.769 Jenny Duan: Grades, test scores. 9 00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.395 huda: Yeah. 10 00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.270 Jenny Duan: Those are the main things. 11 00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.650 Jenny Duan: Do you feel. 12 00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.360 huda: Do you think for Stanford? Should I apply? Test optional. 13 00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.500 Jenny Duan: Your score is 1480, remind me, or I don't remember. 14 00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.210 huda: 30. 15 00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.130 Jenny Duan: What? 16 00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.280 huda: 1530, super scored. 17 00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.909 Jenny Duan: 1530 super score. What's the individual test? Scores. 18 00:01:43.460 --> 00:01",
    ":46.080 huda: 1480 and 1,500. 19 00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.390 Jenny Duan: Okay. 20 00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.800 Jenny Duan: I apply with a 21 00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.279 Jenny Duan: okay, if you have 1,500, right? You don't need to apply. You don't need to go test optional. 22 00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.010 huda: Okay. 23 00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.092 Jenny Duan: You should be fine on that front. 24 00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.349 Jenny Duan: let's we can just see where the 1,500 is on the benchmark. 25 00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.442 Jenny Duan: Let me open the I don't have this number on the top of my head, but I can check it right now for the common data set. 26 00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.329 huda: And does does Stanford do super scores. 27 00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.939 Jenny Duan: Let me see. 28 00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.280 Jenny Duan: they do. Super score. Yes. 29 00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.639 Jenny Duan: you do. Super score, but your individuals still matter a lot. 30 00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.160 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. 31 00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.290 Jenny Duan: let me just check the 32 00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.810 Jenny Duan: testing. 33 00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.810 Jenny Duan: 47% submitted sat scores. 34 00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.910 Jenny Duan: So for the 2023 to 2024 class. 35 00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.290 Jenny Duan: So actually, most people did not. 36 00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.023 Jenny Duan: So 37 00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.620 Jenny Duan: here's what here's what we see with their common data set. 38 00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.219 Jenny Duan: So a score of 1,500 is in the 25th percentile. 39 00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.979 Jenny Duan: So it's like, it's really low for Stanford, but it's not a badly. It's a good score. It's a good score. It's a good score, but we're just talking about Stanford right now. 40 00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.579 Jenny Duan: So 1,500 is in the 2025th percentile, 1530 is between the 25th and the 50th percentile. 41 00:03:29.150 -->",
    " 00:03:30.130 Jenny Duan: So 42 00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.360 Jenny Duan: your score is not great, but it's also not bad. 43 00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.729 Jenny Duan: But since your grades are slightly lower, remind me what your Gpa. Is unweighted. 44 00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:45.689 huda: Like currently 3.9 3. 45 00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.579 Jenny Duan: Yeah, since your Gpa. Is slightly lower, I don't feel like 46 00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:17.589 Jenny Duan: you're. I don't think it really makes a difference whether you submit your sat scores or not like. I think you might as well submit them, because I don't like. I don't think your sat scores like so amazing but it's also like it's it's like what a Stanford student would have like. You're not like, you're definitely definitely not like falling off the benchmark like you have a reasonable sat score for a Stanford student like you're in this like moderate range. So like, yeah, I think you should just submit your sat score. I think it's fine. 47 00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.630 huda: Okay. 48 00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.610 huda: okay, that sounds good. 49 00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.179 Jenny Duan: The grades may be a factor, sat score. And then, do you know, like, I think your letters of Recs should be fine. 50 00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:29.539 Jenny Duan: So I think your activities look great. Your essays look great. 51 00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.959 Jenny Duan: yeah, I mean. 52 00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:48.709 Jenny Duan: I think the only other concern I would have looking at your profile is you don't really have any affiliations with like national organizations. But since you have that one essay that justifies it, because, like Mountain House is a rural place like you already explained that kind of. 53 00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.449 Jenny Duan: So I don't think that that's a major concern. 54 00:04:52.234 --> 00:04:56.359 Jenny Duan: And then I think the other thing that might not be in your favor is 55 00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.34",
    "3 Jenny Duan: you're you're from. The bay area like there's just 56 00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.059 Jenny Duan: a lot of applicants. But you are from a rural town so that might 57 00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:06.779 Jenny Duan: like offset. 58 00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.369 Jenny Duan: but yeah, but even but oh, go ahead. 59 00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:32.919 huda: I saw with like Usc, like you can check like who your regional counselor is, and I think, like they weren't comparing my school with like people in like the actual bay area, like like, we're kind of a little bit outside of the Bay area. So like, we're being compared to people in like the San Joaquin Valley, which are like 60 00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:50.449 huda: Tracy, and like those schools, aren't that great? And I think, like, yeah, there's not that many competitive like profiles, I think, like in that area, but like Dublin and like Pleasanton, which are like a lot more competitive. Those are considered separately, so maybe that might work in my favor. 61 00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:57.270 Jenny Duan: I think that would work in your favor like I think that you have a really strong profile that meets the expectations for Stanford, but 62 00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.680 Jenny Duan: that's that's 63 00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.059 Jenny Duan: to say that, like 64 00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:15.129 Jenny Duan: there are a lot of people who have really strong profiles, who meet the criteria to go to Stanford, so I am confident to say that you're going to get into some really good schools like you're you're going to get into Stanford Level schools. 65 00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:38.790 Jenny Duan: I, as a not as a non admissions officer cannot say that you'll get into Stanford, but I think your profile is strong enough. You'll get into like Stanford, Usc. You know one of the top top schools on your list. I think that your profile is really Stanford aligned like I think your essays are really Stanford aligned. So I think you have like a really",
    " good shot, because of the way that you've written your essays and things, but like 66 00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.630 Jenny Duan: people like can get rejected all the time, for 67 00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.020 Jenny Duan: you know, like no reason or reasons, that 68 00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:59.070 Jenny Duan: only an admissions officer would know, because, like, they only review your profile for, like less than 15 min. So I think you definitely are like, your profile demonstrates that you're a really good fit is so I think at this point it's like 69 00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.259 Jenny Duan: more. So up to like what they think at that point. 70 00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.335 huda: And so earlier, you mentioned that, like I should take ab Spanish because Stanford requires 71 00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.790 Jenny Duan: They recommend foreign language. I'll show you. 72 00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.859 huda: Do you think I should take the Ap. Exam as well. 73 00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:27.330 Jenny Duan: No, you don't have to, unless unless you actually get into Stanford, and then you want to, because then it allows you to skip classes, but like for all your Ap. Exams, like, you don't really need to take any of them 74 00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.899 Jenny Duan: unless you want to. But yes, they recommend they they recommend. 75 00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:46.760 Jenny Duan: 3, at least 3 years of foreign language. But this is recent. In the past they've recommended 4 years of foreign language, so I think they really care about like foreign language and like being a global citizen, and like thinking diversely. 76 00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.060 huda: Yeah. 77 00:07:48.502 --> 00:08:16.220 huda: also. So you know, you know, like the volunteering like the one with the English language development. I was wondering if I could mention that anywhere like maybe, like my additional information or something, because I feel like it's it's also kind of important, because like, I feel like it's also kin",
    "d of connected to my story, because, like, I'm an immigrant and like I like English, wasn't my 1st language as well. So it was like, it's kind of like. 78 00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:23.109 huda: I guess, important to my profile. So I was wondering if I could like mention it anywhere. If, like you think that it's 79 00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:28.900 huda: like better if, like podcast, club, if you think that's more important, or if you think this one's more important. 80 00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:42.640 Jenny Duan: How long have you been doing this for? Because I think another thing that college admissions counselors are really conscious of is like, they know that a lot of people are going to be adding a lot of stuff to their profile, like at the end. And I know both podcast club and this are pretty recent, but. 81 00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.210 huda: Yeah. 82 00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.430 Jenny Duan: Which are you more involved in like? What do you spend more time doing? I would just put the one that you spent the most time doing. 83 00:08:49.840 --> 00:09:02.239 huda: Yeah, I think I definitely spent a lot more time, I think, like I started both of them at around the same time. So like starting of senior year. But I think like I've been more involved with the eld tutoring. 84 00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.940 Jenny Duan: Then maybe you can put y'ld tutoring. And then for podcast stuff, you can put that in with like, there's your student news or student journalism like you can just 85 00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.200 Jenny Duan: somehow. 86 00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:22.920 Jenny Duan: Let's look at I I can look at your activities list right now. Let me do that. But you can just add another bullet point that's like leader of podcast club there. And it's it's fine. If it's not the same like same exact activities. I don't really 87 00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.850 Jenny Duan: think they care that much. 88 00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.529 Jenny Duan: So here, filmmakers club, you can say this. And",
    " you can 89 00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.930 Jenny Duan: if you have, let's see. 90 00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.840 Jenny Duan: maybe you can say like filmmakers, club and podcasting club president, or you could say. 91 00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.960 Jenny Duan: maybe 92 00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.640 Jenny Duan: you can take away this independent thing 93 00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.970 Jenny Duan: if you want to and try to put these into different bullet points. 94 00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.815 huda: Oh, 95 00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.049 huda: I don't know what else it would fit. 96 00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.343 Jenny Duan: That's true. 97 00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.349 Jenny Duan: yeah, maybe your best bet would be to just put 98 00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.270 Jenny Duan: podcast club 99 00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.620 Jenny Duan: into filmmakers, club. 100 00:10:13.607 --> 00:10:24.580 huda: And and then also like, actually like, is it like normal for people to put more like activities in additional information, section or 101 00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.080 huda: is that. 102 00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:34.940 Jenny Duan: Normal. But it's also not that normal, because I think they would rather like you not just be so spread out that you only put like 1 h into everything. 103 00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.699 Jenny Duan: So I think 10 is 104 00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.270 Jenny Duan: is good enough 105 00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:50.719 Jenny Duan: because they don't cause they're gonna calculate, like, how many hours you spend on everything, and they it should come out to a reasonable number like if we, if we add these up like 8 plus 6, 14 plus 5, 19, 106 00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.719 Jenny Duan: can ignore this 2125 107 00:10:53.810 --> 00:11:02.490 Jenny Duan: can ignore this 2730, 34. So if you're spending like 34 h on, this is a reasonable number. But if it comes to like too many hours 108 00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:12.089 Jenny Duan: a week, then they will know that that's unrealistic. But ",
    "they would rather you to go deeper into things that you actually are involved in, rather than to like, try to spread out too much. 109 00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.080 huda: Okay, and 110 00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.699 huda: okay. So I'll try like, putting it into 111 00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.339 huda: like, I think. 112 00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.250 Jenny Duan: This is this is not super 113 00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:33.579 Jenny Duan: consequent, like, I think this bullet point is not super consequential. So I would maybe just copy this, and just like 114 00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.080 Jenny Duan: absorb it into Filmmakers club. 115 00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.320 huda: Okay. 116 00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.600 Jenny Duan: Or I would just not mention podcast club at all. 117 00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's. 118 00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:54.340 huda: That's what I that's what I was wondering, because I feel like I don't put a lot of time into that. But at the same time it does kind of give me like a leadership position like in my profile. But like I'm not sure which one's more important. 119 00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:04.439 Jenny Duan: I think, maybe do the the language volunteering that seems more relevant to your story and your background. And I don't think that you're lacking leadership, like founder, founder, president. 120 00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:11.490 Jenny Duan: founders like Ambassador vice. You know, I think you have enough leadership. I don't think that's a 121 00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.810 Jenny Duan: I don't think that's an issue. 122 00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.030 Jenny Duan: Okay? 123 00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.290 Jenny Duan: Yeah volunteer. 124 00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.890 huda: Computer. I think so 125 00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.190 huda: do I. Do. I need metrics for this cause. I don't think there's any strong like. 126 00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.339 Jenny Duan: How many people did you support like, maybe just write like, how many people you hel",
    "p. 127 00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.600 huda: Yeah. 128 00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.770 huda: Well, I guess like, would they be considered international, like they like came 129 00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.320 huda: came here. But they're like all like immigrants, I guess. 130 00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that you can just write that they're immigrants. That is appropriate 131 00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:19.769 Jenny Duan: immigrants. And are they adults? Are they children? Maybe you can say more information about who you're helping and like, are they refugees like, what are their background? Like? 132 00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 133 00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.250 Jenny Duan: high schoolers, great. 134 00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:52.499 huda: Oh, actually like something that's pretty interesting is that like every Friday we like, make a game for them to like learn English in some way, like, for example, sometimes it's pictionary. Sometimes it's like like a like a photo card game. So I guess it's kind of similar to like all the other educational opportunities that I've gotten as well. 135 00:13:53.528 --> 00:13:56.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely. Maybe. 136 00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.229 Jenny Duan: What's 1 way you could summarize that in one sentence. 137 00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.870 huda: Crafted 138 00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.339 huda: language development 139 00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.300 huda: damn. 140 00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.499 Jenny Duan: Are these virtual games, paper games like, what types of games are these activities. 141 00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.810 huda: And like. 142 00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.039 huda: yeah, like our games, basically. 143 00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.110 Jenny Duan: Specify that. 144 00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.370 huda: Yeah, I think this this looks pretty good. 145 00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that looks good as well. 146 00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.280 Jenny Duan: Hello! 147 00:1",
    "5:05.750 --> 00:15:07.640 Jenny Duan: How many characters is this? 148 00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.260 Jenny Duan: Okay? 99 perfect. You could maybe even add, like one more note. 149 00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.349 Jenny Duan: How many language development card games 150 00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.950 Jenny Duan: did any of them pass? Are you still preparing them, or, like. 151 00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:26.480 huda: Yeah, we're still preparing them. And I don't think there's a lot of games, I think, like 152 00:15:28.493 --> 00:15:32.030 huda: like, maybe even like 5. But that's not a lot. 153 00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:38.439 Jenny Duan: Pretty substantial. You could put 5. And also, are you working with a team? Who are you working with? And what is this program? Through. 154 00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:44.610 huda: Through the school, and I guess I work with some other volunteers. 155 00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:55.330 Jenny Duan: Maybe write something about how you collaborate with others? Or are you a leader like, are you? What is your role like? Are you an organizer. Are you just who's organizing this? Who's running this program? 156 00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.500 huda: It's with the English department. 157 00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.236 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! 158 00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.810 Jenny Duan: Maybe you 159 00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.899 Jenny Duan: collaborate with English Department 160 00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:17.550 Jenny Duan: and peers to prepare 36 immigrant high schoolers for the Lic. Exam. 161 00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.400 Jenny Duan: What is the Eplac Elpac? Exam. 162 00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:35.119 huda: It's like when when you move to the country like you have to like like, pass this exam to show that you can speak English and then usually like international students, also have to submit that during college applications, and like, yeah. 163 00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.039 Jenny Duan: Okay, how is? How's this bullet point? Do you think. 164 00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.760",
    " huda: Yeah, it looks like a lot more con like, concise. Yeah, like it. 165 00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.379 huda: Do you think volunteers are better than tutor. 166 00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.329 Jenny Duan: Maybe say you can say volunteer tutor. 167 00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.439 Jenny Duan: You can just say both. 168 00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.220 Jenny Duan: alright. 169 00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:57.300 Jenny Duan: great. 170 00:16:58.164 --> 00:17:05.829 Jenny Duan: Okay. Let's go back to your Usc supplementals. Review those. Then we can get back to the Stanford one so that you're ready to submit those. 171 00:17:06.228 --> 00:17:13.380 Jenny Duan: So I saw earlier. You had 2 hooks. Did you delete the second one? Or what were your what were your thoughts here. 172 00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:36.369 huda: Yeah, basically like the the past one that I did, which was about like Tetris. I got rid of that because that one was about like educational games. And then I was trying to think of like a different hook. I didn't actually write it, but like because, like, I don't know if this really makes sense in the like context of the question, or like, if it might be too fluffy. But like, yeah, I was just like trying to think of like other ideas. But 173 00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:45.729 huda: for now I just like like stuck with how port like the game portal. It taught me about like all these random things, but it was just good. 174 00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:49.399 huda: an animate object. And so that's like the whole premise of like. 175 00:17:49.699 --> 00:17:58.719 huda: oh, it's like a random thing, but I'm learning so much from it, and then I delve into like, how I I guess, did that with my extracurriculars. 176 00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:28.509 huda: And then I talk about like specific stuff to Usc, I think. Actually, I don't know if I was approaching this correctly, but for the 1st one I talked about like my 1st choice major, which was computer science games. And then I listed like, like, s",
    "imilarly to the Stanford ones. I listed like a couple of places that I see myself at like at the game pipe laboratory, and then at the girls and Games club and caffeine field, all nighters for game jams, and the second one was the journalism. 177 00:18:28.878 --> 00:18:50.649 huda: Major. And then I did some research. And I saw that there's like this thing called the impact studios, where they're like, develop or like, create documentaries about local stories. And then I also kind of connected my game aspect with this one, too. So I said, interviewing like the Trojan esports team for the daily 178 00:18:50.998 --> 00:19:01.099 huda: and then there's like this one class which is also kind of related to game development. It's called like journalism, but like the VR and like. 179 00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:01.735 Jenny Duan: Hmm, 180 00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:12.609 huda: Really cool. It's like like a VR project in the class, basically. And it's like storytelling through. VR, so I think that's like very relevant to me. But yeah. 181 00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:32.270 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's really cool. So just right off the bat. I have like a couple of questions. So I don't really know how portal like this game works. And I think, as an outsider, I'm kind of unclear on how like the gameplay works between the silent, weighted cube and portal. Can you like? Just explain that to me a bit verbally. 182 00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.819 huda: Yeah, like, I think, like throughout the game, there's like, kind of 183 00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:44.320 huda: like, it's kind of hard to explain. But it's like there's like hidden lore, I guess. And then, like 184 00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.190 huda: I guess like 185 00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:55.119 huda: like, it's not directly a part of the game. It's just like revealed through like while you're playing and then, like 186 00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.239 huda: you like, learn these different themes of like loyalty, loss, and like 187 00:19:59.390 --> 00:2",
    "0:05.569 huda: also kind of like comfort as well. I mean, I feel like this isn't the best example, though I feel like there's definitely more. 188 00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.780 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 189 00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.410 huda: Better ways. To show like storytelling in video games. But 190 00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.110 huda: yeah, I wanted to make it like random, like. 191 00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.989 huda: like, not knowing that 192 00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.310 huda: Video games can like actually tell stories. But. 193 00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:28.485 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if random, maybe, is like the right word. Maybe like unexpected, would be better. 194 00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.110 Jenny Duan: But I love this paragraph where it's like. 195 00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:41.989 Jenny Duan: I love this sentence. For me, games are storytelling at its in its most interactive form, tools for empathy action and change. This is phenomenal. It's 196 00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:48.260 Jenny Duan: okay. I think here, it's maybe this is not clear, like, what is what led you to discuss their impact? 197 00:20:48.973 --> 00:20:51.729 Jenny Duan: I think you can specify that like. 198 00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.189 Jenny Duan: maybe it's this ability to 199 00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:05.170 Jenny Duan: play any character or its ability to like, transform or hold any background, or like something along those lines that let me to discuss their impact. Is this, okay? 200 00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.265 Jenny Duan: But that's not where I stop. 201 00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.189 Jenny Duan: I think this transition maybe could be a little bit improved. 202 00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.549 Jenny Duan: but it's fine for now at Usc through the computer science games. Major. 203 00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.389 Jenny Duan: I oh, wait, I think right here. 204 00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.799 Jenny Duan: It's not exactly clear. How education comes in right now, because I think this is maybe left over from t",
    "he previous draft. 205 00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.560 Jenny Duan: because I think. 206 00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:43.700 Jenny Duan: yeah, this beginning is more about storytelling than education. I think this one we want to emphasize like games as storytelling games as narratives, and the other one can be about education. 207 00:21:44.074 --> 00:22:12.375 Jenny Duan: Because we also, I think the other thing that we want to come through here is, how does this relate to your concurrent passion for journalism? Because these majors are a little bit different? You want to see. You want to show the admissions officer how they connect, and it's through this storytelling and this ability to like help the person, the player feel more empathy like. That's why games are so important. And I think, like you should bring that out a little bit more rather than education here. So yeah, this is great. 208 00:22:15.738 --> 00:22:18.410 Jenny Duan: maybe instead of saying 209 00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.929 Jenny Duan: my second choice, Major, you could say something like 210 00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:39.820 Jenny Duan: my passion for journalism also focuses on. I wouldn't just say like second choice, Major, because I think it just. I don't know why. This sounds a little bit crass, but like they'll know it's your second choice, Major, because you'll rank it your second choice, Major, but I don't think you need to say that you know. 211 00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.029 Jenny Duan: also focuses on exploring narratives in in a different form. 212 00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.370 Jenny Duan: Data. Journalism allows me to uncover. You use narratives twice here. 213 00:22:49.050 --> 00:23:00.430 Jenny Duan: Movie stories, narratives, hidden narratives using numbers the same way. Use game mechanics to engage and inform perfect. I see myself. So you say you use this structure. I see myself twice. Maybe you say 214 00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.370 Jenny Duan: something different here as a transition. 215 00:23:",
    "05.670 --> 00:23:12.239 huda: Yeah, I thought I thought it would be kind of a little bit like parallelism. But I think, yeah, it might not make sense. But. 216 00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.110 Jenny Duan: I think right here it comes across a little bit more as 217 00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.440 Jenny Duan: like 218 00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:24.930 Jenny Duan: rep not repetition, but not in an intentional way, because I think the 1st 2 sentences aren't parallel structure. So I think, yeah. 219 00:23:29.197 --> 00:23:32.769 huda: So should I just reword it, or something like like 220 00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.320 huda: like. 221 00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.760 huda: I mean, this is like almost the same thing. But like I can't picture myself. 222 00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.300 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly like exactly. Just instead of see. Just like I visualize, I can picture myself like something 223 00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.660 Jenny Duan: or say at Usc, you'll find me 224 00:23:53.740 --> 00:24:01.590 Jenny Duan: you'd find me, or something. That's another way to say it. I don't know whatever you prefer. I don't think the semantics matter too much. It's just something different. 225 00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.300 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like you would find me, or you could find me. 226 00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.370 huda: This Wilson. 227 00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.900 Jenny Duan: You'll find me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 228 00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.560 Jenny Duan: yeah. That's fine. 229 00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.060 huda: Okay, also. So like this hook, like, I should change it completely. Right. 230 00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:49.420 Jenny Duan: I think so. I I think it's just unclear like I think you would need more context to explain what Portal is, and I'm not sure, like 231 00:24:49.450 --> 00:25:00.910 Jenny Duan: Portal is not a narrative like I think you should start with a narrative like maybe you can say, like playing this character. I became this I like learned about a background compl",
    "etely different from my own. Or I learned about this 232 00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.110 Jenny Duan: person's story which related to 233 00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:13.890 Jenny Duan: some aspect maybe you could turn it into like this character story is similar to like one that you wrote about for folklift or another narrative that you read in the news, or something like that, they can immediately connect it to storytelling. 234 00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.150 Jenny Duan: If there's any characters that come up, if not like. 235 00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.710 Jenny Duan: we can find a game that has one. 236 00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:41.079 huda: Well, okay, this one, this, the game itself is not really known, but like one of my favorite games, mutazion, like, there's like a character. She's like a chef and she has like this, like 237 00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:55.690 huda: story about like how like she moved to this island. And then, like she makes like this food and like her restaurant and everything. And I think it's kind of similar to like some of like the catering small businesses that I wrote about in folklift. 238 00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.380 Jenny Duan: That's great. Yeah. 239 00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.009 Jenny Duan: I would. Definitely, I think that's like, I think that's great. 240 00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.240 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 241 00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.500 huda: And then 242 00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.760 huda: let me just like remember what the name is. 243 00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.190 Jenny Duan: Great. 244 00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.610 huda: Wait. How do I like? How do I bring up the game without like cause like then I feel like 245 00:26:49.800 --> 00:27:02.319 huda: I don't know if I have to give a lot of context as to what the game is to, and then like quickly, just like abruptly, like transition into folklift, like, I'm a bit confused on how to start it. 246 00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:09.380 Jenny Duan: I would say, Okay, can you tell me about the game in your wor",
    "ds? 247 00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.660 Jenny Duan: So you've already given me some context like, it's this cooking game like. Tell me, tell me more. 248 00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:32.960 huda: Yeah, basically, like in the game. They're like, some of the characters are like mutants. And then the other ones are like humans, and then so like the character that I'm talking about. She's like a mutant and she lives on this island, and she has like a restaurant 249 00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:48.930 huda: and then, like, I guess she like started that like restaurants like support, like the people of the island, because there's like, not that many people there. And it's kind of like, the whole game is kind of like a soap opera, basically and like. 250 00:27:49.732 --> 00:28:00.710 huda: yeah. So she started to support her like the people on her island, which actually, now that I'm thinking about it, it's like really similar to like these people that started like 251 00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.260 huda: their own 252 00:28:02.967 --> 00:28:08.339 huda: like, I guess, small businesses to support our small town. But yeah. 253 00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.839 Jenny Duan: Okay. So maybe you can say, like 254 00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.060 Jenny Duan: in 255 00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.160 Jenny Duan: in the game's name you can just say here, like 256 00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.080 Jenny Duan: in Mutazion, I I 257 00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.779 Jenny Duan: I play as blank. 258 00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.430 Jenny Duan: spending hours 259 00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.839 Jenny Duan: blank like cooking, you know, and whatever the character does. 260 00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.990 Jenny Duan: I play as the character's name comma like a mutant something, you know. 261 00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.889 Jenny Duan: I don't know how you would describe what she does 262 00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:51.259 Jenny Duan: a mutant chef like crafting recipes to feed her time or like I don't.

Do you see, like, before, the word data you can say, like 293 00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:45.064 Jenny Duan: also exploring exploring stories just in a different form. Maybe you can say like at home. 294 00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:54.339 Jenny Duan: I interviewed, and then you can talk about how like her story is similar to Maurice. So that way you can have that continuity throughout the essay. 295 00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.440 huda: Oh, I see! 296 00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.949 Jenny Duan: Wait. Let me just look at some places to shorten this. 297 00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:32.380 huda: Also, actually, I'm kind of worried that this might be repetitive to like, I think, essay number 2, which is the one about like, what do you add to 298 00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:39.180 huda: the Turby cause? I remember I kind of mentioned about like how some housewives turned entrepreneurs 299 00:32:39.758 --> 00:32:41.630 huda: and they also sell. 300 00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:45.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you're right. 301 00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.690 Jenny Duan: Okay, is there another story, another character that is similar. 302 00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.979 Jenny Duan: I think you, I think you just need to write about a character story, maybe just like from a different lens. 303 00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:14.450 huda: I feel like I don't know, like any other li",
    "ke characters that 304 00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.019 huda: relate to like someone I've interviewed as well, but like. 305 00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:25.209 Jenny Duan: It doesn't have to be a character you interviewed just like a story that was different than your own, or shared something new to you. 306 00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:26.975 huda: Oh, 307 00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:37.650 huda: I guess, like one important 1. 1 was like that one game that I told you about earlier, about like where there's like a detective rocket. 308 00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.790 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, what did?

It's too abstract like. It's not a person you're not adopting like a person story. You're connecting with an object, at least to my understanding and correct me if that's wrong. 316 00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:41.859 Jenny Duan: But 317 00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.520 Jenny Duan: I think it's just about like showing the more human aspect of storytelling through games. 318 00:34:49.719 --> 00:35:11.029 huda: Maybe, like I think I could. Maybe I could still use use Maury like the the chef. Maybe like maybe I don't have to connect it to like the person I interviewed for folklift. But like I think she did like this character did give me like a different perspective, because",

Great 436 00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:21.970 Jenny Duan: Okay? 437 00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.510 Jenny Duan: yeah. 438 00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.619 Jenny Duan: Let's look at the question. 439 00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.120 Jenny Duan: 3. Now. 440 00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:42.419 Jenny Duan: this is good. This is really good. And I like how you put this like. I think this essay fits a lot better with Question 2 441 00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.099 Jenny Duan: than the earlier one. What do you like? How do you feel about this. 442 00:46:46.580 --> 00:47:01.869 huda: Yeah, I like, okay, so I had a couple of doubts. So this street, I like by doing some research to make sure that, like Usc students like know that this this is iconic. And I I think so like, I'm not completely sure if, like 443 00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:15.349 huda: it's super well known. And then another thing is like over here, and I think it's also in the Stanford essay. It's like limited food access. It might sound like we just like. Don't have food at all like it. Just like sounds like. 444 00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.320 Jenny Duan: That's a food desert, is it? Or not? I don't know. 445 00:47:19.395 --> 00:47:40.439 huda: I don't really know like what classifies. I think like now, it's not because there's a lot of restaurants and like grocery stores like they're coming in. But like at the time of like freshman year through, like, almost like most of the developments are now so like we didn't have access to those thi",
    "ngs before, but I don't know if I'd call it a food desert. I guess. 446 00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.120 Jenny Duan: Alright. It's not a food desert. I just looked 447 00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.440 Jenny Duan: like. 448 00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:08.909 huda: I don't know, like maybe, like in an in like less vague words like lack of like 449 00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.120 huda: resources, and like like lack of 450 00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.390 huda: hmm. 451 00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.739 Jenny Duan: You can also just take this out and just say this. 452 00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.180 huda: Okay. 453 00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.051 Jenny Duan: I think maybe that's like, just. 454 00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.179 huda: Yeah, I think better. And I think I'll change that for the Stanford essays as well. 455 00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.270 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. 456 00:48:55.830 --> 00:49:01.530 Jenny Duan: I think this is too much of a telling statement. I think this is fine, but I get this. 457 00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:02.740 Jenny Duan: Oh. 458 00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:12.600 huda: Yeah, okay, so I'm like, actually, I was pretty torn about this because, I would wanna like mention that, like 459 00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:18.637 huda: the story about like not having resources like an example of me being an improvising innovator. 460 00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.520 huda: but like, I don't know if, like 3 stories is way too much. 461 00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.739 Jenny Duan: No, I don't think so. I think that is good. 462 00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.359 Jenny Duan: I think I think this makes sense. 463 00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:33.460 huda: Okay. 464 00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:40.663 Jenny Duan: I I don't think you need to include the sentence, because it's a bit of a showing sentence, a telling sentence. When you already show this throughout. 465 00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:42.670 Jenny Duan: yeah. 466 00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.160 huda: This this one. 467 00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:49.710 Jenny Duan: No,",
    " this. This is what shaped me to become an improvising innovator. 468 00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:50.750 huda: Okay. 469 00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:58.390 Jenny Duan: If you want, maybe you can say this is who I am an improvising innovator. You can say this is who I am. If you don't want to say this is who I'll be at Usc. 470 00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.049 huda: Yeah, I think I think it all makes more sense. 471 00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.359 Jenny Duan: Okay. 472 00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.719 Jenny Duan: yeah. And I think the rest of this looks good. 473 00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:20.150 huda: Let me see. 474 00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:27.060 huda: Oh, this is 3 38 words, and it's supposed to be 2 50. So I think. 475 00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.939 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's cut it down. Let's cut it down. 476 00:50:31.745 --> 00:50:32.410 Jenny Duan: fair. 477 00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.820 Jenny Duan: Well, most people drive past 478 00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.660 Jenny Duan: Manhat's California. Okay, I'll just take this 479 00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.190 Jenny Duan: among this 480 00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.950 Jenny Duan: smell of manure and power and frequent power outages 481 00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.300 Jenny Duan: the self-sustaining community. 482 00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.750 Jenny Duan: Hey, Tyler. 483 00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:51.470 Jenny Duan: I quickly learned that 484 00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.750 Jenny Duan: Swissip. 485 00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.840 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm just gonna delete this 486 00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.080 Jenny Duan: exactly. 487 00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:21.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 488 00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.789 huda: I don't know if it's necessary. 489 00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:50.770 Jenny Duan: And instead of table, is there like a funny Usc reference? We could say like, I don't. I don't know. If, like at Stanford, we could say like, I'll bring this this spirit to the to the quad, or like to the oval or something. But I don't know about Usc. 490 00:52:18.2",
    "20 --> 00:52:19.280 huda: And 491 00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:43.979 huda: I'm not sure I don't think so. 492 00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.039 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! That's fine. 493 00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:02.930 Jenny Duan: 2, 65. Okay. 494 00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.589 Jenny Duan: I think. Hello, me is. 495 00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.200 Jenny Duan: it's fine. Here. 496 00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.480 huda: Okay? Cause I I already kind of like mentioned, like Indian Muslim girls. So I 497 00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:40.640 huda: don't know if, like, I'll just 498 00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.039 huda: kind of removing that for word count, but. 499 00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.720 Jenny Duan: Okay. 500 00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:42.940 Jenny Duan: 54. Forwards. 501 00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:48.162 huda: Also like, Okay. 502 00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:26.890 huda: I'm not sure. Let me check if if Usc also has, like the P sets like kind of like term 503 00:55:27.179 --> 00:55:31.490 huda: cause. Then over here it's the same like complex machine learning challenges. I could say, like 504 00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.740 huda: tough P sets, or something like that. 505 00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:47.559 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is fine. I think I think I already took out all the over 2 50 words. Now you want to check it. 506 00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:49.290 huda: Okay. 507 00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.630 Jenny Duan: You give it a 1 over. 508 00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.169 huda: Okay, yeah, that looks good. Do you think? Do you think this is big? 509 00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.490 Jenny Duan: Where. 510 00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.440 huda: Navigating a complex machine. Learning challenges. 511 00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.020 Jenny Duan: Whether it's maybe say, like 512 00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:52.699 Jenny Duan: reference, a specific class at Usc, like whether it's solving Cs. Stanford, Cs 224 psets, or something else like. 513 00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:58.550 Jenny Duan: I think, just put a specific Usc class code there. 514 00",
    ":57:02.170 --> 00:57:07.399 Jenny Duan: Oh, you can do that in your own time. I'm gonna move on to the next essay given that we have limited time. 515 00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:15.129 Jenny Duan: I love this essay. When I was reading it I felt it felt a lot more personal, and I think it clearly distinguishes itself from essay one 516 00:57:15.509 --> 00:57:19.020 Jenny Duan: I would not say mental disabilities, I would maybe say like 517 00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.119 Jenny Duan: I don't know what the correct word is. 518 00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.779 huda: Like impairments. 519 00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.590 Jenny Duan: I don't know if Adhd is considered like 520 00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.990 Jenny Duan: a disability. 521 00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:32.050 huda: It's a disorder, I think. 522 00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.730 Jenny Duan: Wouldn't describe it as it does. Such a negative connotation. 523 00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:53.790 huda: Maybe like, instead of just saying like mental disorders, I I think they fall under the umbrella of like neurodiversity. 524 00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:56.870 Jenny Duan: Yeah, my neurodivergent relatives with Adhd. 525 00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.830 Jenny Duan: yeah. 526 00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.660 Jenny Duan: often struggle to learn through lectures, but thrive when learning is 527 00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:23.409 Jenny Duan: alright. I think this essay, this beginning of this sentence is a little cliche, so I would fix this. 528 00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:24.520 Jenny Duan: Let's come back. 529 00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:37.869 Jenny Duan: I don't know if you necessarily need folklot here. 530 00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:43.850 huda: Yeah, I think it's because earlier, I hadn't mentioned it in any of the other paragraphs or essays. 531 00:58:44.367 --> 00:58:51.309 Jenny Duan: Do you mention it anywhere else? Because it seems like this is also just like essay one in a different form, because you're still referencing journalism. 532 00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:59.120 ",
    "huda: Yeah, I don't think I need it. Actually, I think I slightly mentioned it in this, the essay before 533 00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.190 huda: the 534 00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.270 huda: like, the diversity essay, I think, yeah. 535 00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:04.930 huda: So I could 536 00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:07.390 huda: possibly like, get rid of that one. 537 00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:10.050 Jenny Duan: Let's get rid of it. Where do you mention it? Here. 538 00:59:10.925 --> 00:59:13.530 huda: Here when it's like the thing about like 539 00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:17.690 huda: coding websites for housewives turned entrepreneurs. 540 00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.350 huda: And I think I 541 00:59:20.157 --> 00:59:23.509 huda: actually, I don't mention in the 1st one. But yeah, in this one. 542 00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:36.819 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! Maybe, instead of writing so much about Usc here, just add a mention for folk lift here. 543 00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:42.719 Jenny Duan: Do you think you do you think that fits, or do you think that would not work well here. 544 00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.880 huda: Here. 545 00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.729 Jenny Duan: In the 1st essay. 546 00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:46.830 Jenny Duan: both 547 00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:50.719 Jenny Duan: in when you write my passion for journalism in this paragraph, like, could you just 548 00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:55.889 Jenny Duan: write a little bit less about Usc. And then add something about folklift, just like a mention. 549 01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.620 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can see it 550 01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:07.919 Jenny Duan: through through. Like my experience in folklift. I discovered that data journalism, something like that. 551 01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.380 huda: Okay, actually, I don't know if I want to highlight. 552 01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:20.430 huda: I don't know if I want to highlight data journalism, because I don't know if my profile has enough like for that 553 01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:25.449 hu",
    "da: and so maybe I could like replace a sentence to talk about folk live. 554 01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:32.079 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's what I would do. Okay? Then I would cut it out of here, because I think this is a little distracting. I don't think this. 555 01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:37.909 Jenny Duan: So this little paragraph here in Essay 3 makes sense in the context of the entire essay. 556 01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:41.399 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I would delete this. 557 01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.750 Jenny Duan: Okay. 558 01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:45.509 huda: I'm just gonna delete it. 559 01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.080 huda: Hmm. 560 01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.930 Jenny Duan: Can you start this off? And then, with your extra word, Count, can you start this off with a more compelling example? 561 01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:09.890 Jenny Duan: Because I feel like you're starting off with a generalization which is fine because this is true. But like, we want to know why this matters to you like. Obviously, you have neurodivergent relatives. That's important. But like, I'm still not seeing 562 01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:20.040 Jenny Duan: like, why this matters to you so much, and how you found out like, why, this is an issue that you want to solve versus other issues, or why? Why like you care so much about this. 563 01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.700 huda: Yeah, I think I I can start it off with 564 01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:25.506 huda: something a little more. 565 01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.680 huda: personal, I guess. 566 01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.859 huda: And then 567 01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.420 huda: as for this like wording. 568 01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.550 Jenny Duan: Like, maybe say, like through through game, like 569 01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.379 Jenny Duan: through games or like games, become a way to. 570 01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:51.230 huda: Yeah. 571 01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:55.289 Jenny Duan: Where, like through puzzles or through something, games become a way to interact. 572 01:",
    "01:58.070 --> 01:02:03.770 huda: I think this is a continuation of like the part where I'm talking about Synthoria. So like 573 01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400 huda: through. 574 01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:16.720 Jenny Duan: Like, I think you use this type of sentence structure quite frequently, like here, too, it's the same sentence structure, these challenges about more than improving education. It's about making sure, like you don't have to say 575 01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.789 Jenny Duan: this part. You can just say this challenge 576 01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.040 Jenny Duan: reinforces that learning environments, or 577 01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:26.959 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need the sentence actually at all. 578 01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:31.910 huda: Okay. 579 01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.890 Jenny Duan: Or maybe, like personalized learning ensures that 580 01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:40.200 Jenny Duan: learning environments meet everyone where they are. They are the key to ensuring that 581 01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.850 Jenny Duan: I think these 2 sentences are repetitive, so I think you can keep one of them. 582 01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.520 huda: Okay. 583 01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.220 Jenny Duan: And 584 01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:53.649 Jenny Duan: the solutions I create. This is broad, but you can say something like through synthoria and beyond, or like connected back to what you do. 585 01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.139 huda: Yeah, I like synthra and beyond. 586 01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:00.750 huda: okay. 587 01:03:02.097 --> 01:03:05.370 Jenny Duan: I think these 2 sentences are the same. What do you? 588 01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.580 Jenny Duan: So you can delete one of them. Yeah. 589 01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.220 huda: I like the bottom of the letter. 590 01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:15.590 Jenny Duan: So now you have more room to to start with.

    "92 01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.829 Jenny Duan: How many words do you have? 1, 25 around that? 593 01:03:24.266 --> 01:03:27.200 Jenny Duan: So I would put that in the beginning. 594 01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.590 huda: Does this make sense through these? 595 01:03:35.661 --> 01:03:39.319 huda: Like, I don't know how to like word this, but like through these. 596 01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:47.789 huda: I think that doesn't make sense cause. I'm trying to continue over from what I'm talking about through how I'm teaching like AI ethics through playful many games. 597 01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.269 Jenny Duan: Like through personalized quests. 598 01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.440 Jenny Duan: you know, get like personalized quests. 599 01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:58.269 Jenny Duan: What are some other features of interactive learning. 600 01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.450 Jenny Duan: interactive challenges? 601 01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:02.180 Jenny Duan: And 602 01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:03.379 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 603 01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.290 huda: and. 604 01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.949 Jenny Duan: I guess I don't know. 605 01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:18.990 huda: Oh, yeah. 606 01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.240 Jenny Duan: Something like like something like that, like the key components of gamified learning. 607 01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:28.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, and I think you have enough room now to write your beginning. 608 01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.760 Jenny Duan: and then you should be good. 609 01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.870 huda: So should I still keep this this part. 610 01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.500 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's still fine. 611 01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:37.649 Jenny Duan: You can also talk about. 612 01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:40.050 Jenny Duan: I mean, you kind of 613 01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:41.510 Jenny Duan: hmm. 614 01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:45.789 Jenny Duan: No, you don't. You can talk about eld here you can talk about like 615 01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.500 Jenny Duan: how",
    " you design games for Eld. Maybe that would be like a good beginning, too. 616 01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:53.470 huda: Okay, yeah, that that sounds good. 617 01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:57.319 Jenny Duan: Because then you can write about Yaeld and Synthoria. In this essay. 618 01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.670 huda: Hmm. 619 01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:05.449 Jenny Duan: Like. I mean, I'm sure, with Eld, you, you meet students from like all different backgrounds, right or different types of students. 620 01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:08.640 Jenny Duan: So that would connect that would like seamlessly transition to this. 621 01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:12.488 huda: Yeah, I like that. Actually, 622 01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:14.230 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna write. 623 01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:17.640 Jenny Duan: Okay. 624 01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:25.189 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel a lot better about these essays. I think once you make these changes, they should be good. 625 01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.560 Jenny Duan: And then once you're done writing them. 626 01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.869 Jenny Duan: just ping me, and I can take a look at them, too. 627 01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:39.370 Jenny Duan: I'll look at your Stanford essays tonight so that I'm able to give you some feedback on that before you send them to your dad again. 628 01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:54.169 huda: Okay, actually like, I think I don't think much has changed since the last time finalized them. So just like, I'll try to see if my can, if my dad can like look at it before tonight, and then with his comments like, maybe 629 01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:55.780 huda: I can let you know. 630 01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:08.459 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that sounds good. I remember your Stanford essays are like final. I think they look really good. I'm not concerned, but I think it does help to have fresh eyes. So if your dad could read them, if you want your mom or your sister or anyone else to read them 631 01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:13.190 Jenny Duan: like they might be able t",
    "o pick up things that we haven't noticed, because we've been looking at it for so long. 632 01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.969 huda: Yeah. Okay. Great. 633 01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:21.059 Jenny Duan: I'm so proud of your progress. I can't believe that you're about to submit your Stanfor, Stanford.

So you've done what you can. You know, you are an amazing student. Just breathe. It's okay. 636 01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:44.620 Jenny Duan: Okay. 637 01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.750 huda: Thank you so much. 638 01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:50.229 Jenny Duan: Yeah, see ya, and text me if you need anything.
