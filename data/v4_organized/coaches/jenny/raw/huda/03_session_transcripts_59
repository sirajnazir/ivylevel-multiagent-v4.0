How's it going. 2 00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.289 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.570 Jenny Duan: I'm good. I wanna hear all about your trip. It's been so long. How is London? And are you not going to India, or is, is it your dad going? But you're not. 4 00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:23.680 huda: Yeah, it's just it's just gonna be my dad. But London was so fun it was. It was really cool, like, we went to a lot of museums and my brother really enjoyed them especially. But yeah, it was really cool like this. The everything was like so different from America, like well, there was just like the scenery, and then and then, like even like everything is historical. So it's like cool cause, if you like. If even if you go to like a random village, it's gonna be like 5 00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:35.510 huda: years old, like decades old. But yeah, that was that was pretty interesting. Yeah. My dad's just off to India. As like an emergency visit. But. 6 00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.250 Jenny Duan: Oh, is everything okay? Is is it okay? 7 00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.180 huda: Yeah, it's just like one of our relatives aren't feeling so well. So. 8 00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.770 Jenny Duan: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. 9 00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.189 Jenny Duan: When was the last time you were in India? 10 00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.240 huda: Like 11 00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.069 huda: 11 to 12 years ago. 12 00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.109 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh! When are you gonna be back to India? 13 00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.810 Jenny Duan: That seems like a really long time. 14 00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.459 huda: Yeah, I really wanna go. I was thinking, like, maybe summer after senior year. But I don't know for sure. 15 00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:14.720 Jenny Duan: Hmm, makes a lot of sense. But yeah, tell me more about London, like, what was I mean? I know you've been wanting to do this for a long time, so like what were the highlights, the museums? Your brother liked it like everything's historical. What else. 16 00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.632 huda: I also really liked. 17 00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:32.780 huda: I mean, okay. So one time we went on kind of like a day trip. It was a bit hectic and like the weather, was kind of less hot than California. So that was kind of good thing, but the same time it was like raining a lot. So that's 1 thing I didn't like. 18 00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:48.899 huda: But we're on this like day trip. Outside of like London. And there was like all these like different places, like like Windsor's. We got to the Windsor Castle. We got to see this small town called Bath, I think like a lot of the like. The Richardson. 19 00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.920 huda: Oh, it was like shot there, so that was pretty cool to see. 20 00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.200 Jenny Duan: Really cool. 21 00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:56.329 huda: And yeah, we just got to see, like. 22 00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.640 huda: I'm pretty sure, we got to see i'm, not sure, if it was actually like one of the wonders of the world. But there was one place called like the Stone Hedge. It was really cool. 23 00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.390 Jenny Duan: Oh, my stone head is so famous! Oh. 24 00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.810 Jenny Duan: cool. 25 00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.460 huda: Yeah, it was really cool. And I I got to bring my camera. So I did lots of photography there. And yeah, it was really nice. 26 00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.310 Jenny Duan: That's so amazing. I'm glad that you had a really good time, and you got back. And you hosted the hackathon. So how was that. 27 00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:52.340 huda: That was definitely like, really, really, really hectic, I think even more hectic than like the London trip. I think. It was planning everything cause you know. The week we got back was a week before the hackathon, and then like a lot of like the sponsors were backing out. And then there was like judges who weren't being responsive and like, there's like a bunch of like issues with that like last minute. So then, there's a lot of like. 28 00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:15.840 huda: especially for the judges. I just like posted it everywhere, like on the Ncwt. Slack on the encode. Justice slack on like the code with clossy channel like I, I found judges like in the last minute, to be honest and then we like finalized all the sponsors, and then marketing. And I, I feel like everything was basically done on last week, like we did do lots of preparation like we got our sponsors and everything like 29 00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.929 huda: before we went on the trip. But then it was just like even even like everything just sped up in the last week. 30 00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:34.378 huda: But then, in terms of the actual hackathon. I think it was like a really good experience. I think it was a bit hectic, because that we had to like, wake up early to practice the opening ceremony. We had to. 31 00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:45.260 huda: you know, attend every single workshop, and like kind of record everything, and make sure. They're go running smoothly. And then we have to be like online the entire time, so that we can answer questions. 32 00:04:45.260 --> 00:05:04.675 huda: But I mean, I think it was a fun experience, because it was like nice kind of like hosting a hackathon for once, cause I kind of remember like being like part of a hackathon and like how the organizers were really helpful. So I really wanted to kind of do that with empower hacks as well. And then also I just I feel like it was bit 33 00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.959 huda: like I feel like 34 00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:25.059 huda: with my team. They weren't doing as much which I kind of understand, because it's kind of like as like the President, I have this responsibility that I have to kind of be in charge of things. But yeah, it was kind of like it felt that there's like a lot of pressure on me as well. So I did have to do like 35 00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:40.769 huda: kind of go and get some testimonials, hop on calls with some teams and kind of like check in with everyone. And everyone else is kind of not doing as much. And then I did a lot of the screen recordings as well, but I guess that it is my responsibility. So yeah. 36 00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:42.849 huda: other than that. 37 00:05:44.310 --> 00:06:09.009 huda: Oh, sorry other than that. Like it was, it was really nice. And then we learned I learned a lot of things throughout this hackathon like, for example, right after the hackathon. I had to like, create certificates for everyone, and kind of send those out and kind of like that process because I didn't really think about like certificates and like sending out emails. And that process. So that was like something new that I learned. And then 38 00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:16.250 huda: also, like Dev post has this feature where it has, where, like you can see, like the metrics of your hackathon 39 00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:42.029 huda: and then I learned that that features like really nice, because I was able to create like a Google sheets. And then I was able to find, like the total amount of countries, the total amount of cities that participated and then, even like the average skill level like cause, one of the questions was like, Oh, on a scale of 10, like, what's your skill level. And then, we're able to find that statistic. And that's gonna be like pretty helpful when we're marketing it afterwards. 40 00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:54.469 huda: So I think I did learn a lot from this hackathon. I think it was overall really great experience. A little bit like too much pressure. But I mean I enjoyed it? Towards the end. Yeah. 41 00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.830 Jenny Duan: That's amazing. Yeah, again, like, super happy for you. That sounds 42 00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.380 Jenny Duan: like a really good time. And like. 43 00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:15.400 Jenny Duan: it just seems like a really good learning experience overall and like, how many people do you have the metrics? For, like how many people showed up, you said, like some sponsors backed out. How many sponsors you have like? How many judges did you have? Do you have any numbers there. 44 00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.460 huda: Yeah, so we have 4 sponsors. 45 00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:45.090 huda: And then in total, we're about, we are able to raise $23,000 and prizes. And that's including, like the different subscriptions. And then the different yeah, like the domain names and other stuff that we got provided. So in total, like, everything was basically sponsored by like our sponsors. But then, like the top, 3 prizes were sponsored by our team. 46 00:07:45.090 --> 00:08:00.350 huda: and which they weren't really like too much of a prize pool like. We just provided like, maybe, like a gaming keyboard and a gaming mouse, and then, like a Bluetooth speaker like we provided those small things, and then the other prizes were kind of provided by our sponsors. 47 00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:04.860 huda: And then, in terms of like other metrics, there were like. 48 00:08:05.228 --> 00:08:10.999 huda: there's like around a hundred people that showed up there was like, like, basically a hundred. So it was like. 49 00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:24.870 huda: like 95, that kind of like range. But and then there's like people from 4 different continents, 16 different countries. And like, I think it was 50 00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.050 huda: like 51 00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.320 huda: 40, 46 different cities. 52 00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.790 Jenny Duan: Would you be able to capture? Wait, can you? 53 00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:37.499 Jenny Duan: Can we like? Okay, I'm gonna write down all of these statistics. So how many people total. 54 00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.919 huda: So like around a hundred, yeah. 55 00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.032 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then 56 00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:44.709 Jenny Duan: the price pool is 23,000. Right? Yeah. 57 00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.000 huda: That's a little over that actually. 58 00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.819 Jenny Duan: Wow! How many? Judges? 59 00:08:49.631 --> 00:08:52.700 huda: There were 6, I think. Let me double check. 60 00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.839 Jenny Duan: Switches. Okay? 61 00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:05.699 huda: There's 7. Actually sorry. 62 00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:12.259 Jenny Duan: 7 judges around, 100 participants from. And you were saying they were from how many different countries. 63 00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:14.550 huda: They were from. 64 00:09:15.449 --> 00:09:17.909 huda: Let me double check, I said. 65 00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.780 huda: Okay, it looks like 66 00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.380 huda: from 16 different countries. 67 00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:25.925 Jenny Duan: Okay. 68 00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.900 Jenny Duan: 16 different countries. And then you were saying, what else. 69 00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.799 huda: And around like 46 different cities. 70 00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:43.779 huda: and then on a scale of 10, the average experience level over Hackathon. Like participants was 5. 71 00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:45.679 huda: Yeah. 5. 72 00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.580 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's it. 73 00:09:52.256 --> 00:09:54.690 huda: And then that's kind of 74 00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.829 huda: all the statistics that we're able to get from that. 75 00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.110 huda: But then, like I mean. 76 00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:16.820 huda: it does. I don't think this is really means anything. But there's like, they're from 4 different continents. Yeah. And then we also saw from, like our data, that there was actually some people that found out about our hackathon from their college, and that was like pretty interesting. 77 00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.620 Jenny Duan: Oh, how did you get that data. 78 00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:31.519 huda: So like that post has like when you're signing up, it kinda asks you like, oh, where'd you find out about empower hacks? And then you can like find that. And then the person is actually from Algeria, which is pretty interesting, that. 79 00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.040 Jenny Duan: There, and. 80 00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.150 huda: You know how. 81 00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.840 Jenny Duan: That's like, who knows? That's so cool like 82 00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:45.009 Jenny Duan: that, like you should be so proud of yourself like this is incredible that you got so many people to sign out from so many different parts of the world like. 83 00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.299 Jenny Duan: you know, like that's really cool. How many workshops that you have total. 84 00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:53.220 huda: We had around like 4, including the judges, panel. 85 00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.719 Jenny Duan: And then how many do you know how many submissions you got. 86 00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.190 huda: We got 20 submissions. 87 00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.470 Jenny Duan: Pretty good. 88 00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:08.669 Jenny Duan: That's actually like pretty good, considering, like 100 people. Did you get to look through the submissions like, did anyone make anything that you thought was really cool. 89 00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:26.308 huda: Yeah, I think so. Our winning project was called Code. Her. I think that was like, honestly one of like the best projects I've seen in a while, and especially considering like her hackathon, was only 27 h, and then the yeah. So the the girl she like built 90 00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.599 huda: Oh, yeah, let me share 91 00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:50.550 huda: it was, I don't. I don't know how like open it, I think. There's like a demo video. But it's like she basically had like an AI like. 92 00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:52.979 Jenny Duan: You need to get more Google drive store. 93 00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.109 huda: Yeah, it's we're putting all the recordings on there. 94 00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.070 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's probably why, okay. 95 00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.780 Jenny Duan: okay. 96 00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.109 Jenny Duan: can. So can you explain that she uses an AI? What. 97 00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.153 huda: Oh, can you hear the audio? I think she's explaining better. 98 00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.469 Jenny Duan: Share any audio? And did you share screen audio. 99 00:12:15.346 --> 00:12:16.700 huda: Oh, okay. 100 00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.369 Jenny Duan: I don't know if I can hear anything still. 101 00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.879 Jenny Duan: and I can't hear you speaking. If you're talking. 102 00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:39.540 Jenny Duan: There we go! 103 00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:41.710 Jenny Duan: Oh. 104 00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.420 huda: Oh, okay. 105 00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.819 huda: I'll just explain it. I guess I don't know. 106 00:12:46.970 --> 00:13:09.430 huda: It's not like it's asking me like on my password or something. It's not working. But basically it's like, it has a bunch of aspects. It like has, like a AI Chatbot, which can speak in like many different languages. And it helps you like, learn coding skills and like and it helps kind of give opportunities like recommend opportunities for women in tech. 107 00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:26.819 huda: And then it also has, like a bunch of resources like that's another aspect. And then there's also, like, a kind of networking page where it shows, like different women to network with like coding stars, as they call it. But yeah, it's it's really cool. I'm I'm very impressed by. 108 00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.950 Jenny Duan: No, I'm 27 h too. 109 00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:36.990 huda: Yeah. This person actually lives nearby me, like in the Bay area, like they live in Pleasanton, which is like 30 min away. 110 00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.510 huda: Yeah. 111 00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.519 huda: let me see if I can. 112 00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.728 Jenny Duan: That's really good turnout, especially for a 113 00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.970 Jenny Duan: especially for a virtual hackathon, too. 114 00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.970 huda: Yeah. 115 00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:09.980 Jenny Duan: You know, like people chose to do this like they chose to be there and spend their time doing your hackathon like no one, forced them to like they chose to be there, and that's just awesome. 116 00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.884 huda: Yeah, it was. It was really nice. Cause like, the people were also like participating. So 117 00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:34.992 huda: as part of our hackathon they were like. There's like a challenge we did. It's called the Content challenge. And then they were basically either make memes or like make reels and stuff documenting their like coding journey, and then they'd get like a free domain name as like one of our sponsors. And then 118 00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:54.879 huda: And so, like a lot of people submitted to that which we're planning on sharing like on Linkedin and like Instagram and stuff. But yeah, that was like, I think our challenge like was really interactive. And a lot a lot of people do. We're doing stuff for like the prizes. But that was so. That was so like really cool that a lot of people were interested. 119 00:14:55.496 --> 00:14:56.089 huda: That's okay. 120 00:14:56.416 --> 00:14:59.350 Jenny Duan: Also, your social media has been popping off recently. 121 00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:05.189 Jenny Duan: like I saw ton of new followers, and like it's been, I see, like all the comments. 122 00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:20.659 huda: Yeah, yeah, we've been. I think there's like, also like this thing with like, if you're like an Instagram for like a nonprofit. And you start phone like other nonprofits. They're really really nice, like, we have like a group chat. And then, like, we all kind of support each other's 123 00:15:21.013 --> 00:15:22.680 huda: thing. So that's really cool. 124 00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.950 Jenny Duan: Really awesome. 125 00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.489 huda: I don't know if it would be able to answer this question. But 126 00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:49.140 huda: yeah, it's pretty. It's really cool. For, like like an AI developed in like 27 h. It's pretty cool. 127 00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.370 Jenny Duan: This is the Chat Gpt. Wrapper. 128 00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.830 huda: not sure. 129 00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.430 Jenny Duan: Where are they? 130 00:15:58.744 --> 00:15:59.060 huda: Link. 131 00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.290 Jenny Duan: No AI! 132 00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.790 huda: Oh, and there's also like a game in it. It's pretty cool. 133 00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.170 Jenny Duan: Oh! 134 00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.670 huda: I'm not sure it's probably like in here, or something. 135 00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.340 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 136 00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.769 Jenny Duan: yeah. I mean, it's it doesn't matter. That's like awesome, though. 137 00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.770 huda: Yeah, yeah, it was like, it's really impressive. 138 00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:37.289 huda: And we have like a lot of some of these weren't really related to women in tech cause. I think people just join just to submit and see if they'd win. 139 00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.380 huda: But, like it's still like 140 00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:54.210 huda: there's still like a lot of good ones which we gave honorable mentions like this is actually the people's like 1st time coding and like ha! Being in my hackathon and as well as this one like this person's 1st hackathon. 141 00:16:54.775 --> 00:17:09.850 huda: These people are like from like Ucla and Ucsd, there's it's pretty cool. And there's actually this one is like, really interesting. Cause there's like someone from Turkey. There's someone who yeah. And there's someone who studied Georg at Georgia, tech 142 00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:15.169 huda: and then and there's someone who study at Stanford. So that's really cool. 143 00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.971 Jenny Duan: Oh, my God! We you literally got a Stanford student to S to participate in your hackathon. 144 00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.880 huda: Like. 145 00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.550 Jenny Duan: Isn't that amazing like? Think about it. 146 00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:39.470 huda: Yeah, and it was it was really nice cause she was able to like kind of she or I asked her like, how's your experience going? She's like, Oh, it's going really. Well. I really love how you guys have organized things, those it's kind of validating to see that other people are enjoying it. But yeah. 147 00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.590 Jenny Duan: That's really cool. Did you send out a feedback survey at the end. 148 00:17:43.370 --> 00:18:12.049 huda: Yeah, it was also like it was kind of like a like. I went to individual groups and then I hopped on like a call with them. And then I I did like a screen recording, and then I asked them a couple of questions about empower hacks, and then I asked them if they could kind of show off their project a little bit, and I hope to like it might take me a while to edit. But I'm thinking of like kind of doing a compilation of like the different testimonials and seeing like and kind of showing 149 00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.210 huda: kind of doing like a conclusion. Video of empower hacks. Yeah. 150 00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:24.639 Jenny Duan: That's really awesome. Do you feel like it was a gratifying experience. I know you put so much work into it like even that. That banner. You designed that right? 151 00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.470 huda: Yeah. 152 00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:30.329 Jenny Duan: Like every detail like you put so much time into it. And how do you feel now that it's over? 153 00:18:31.000 --> 00:19:00.840 huda: Honestly, I think it's I think it was really like validating like, just because I've put a lot of effort into like the different events like that, like the AI ethics Bootcamp thing that we did and like. Barely any one showed up. And then this time just having like a hackathon, which, like almost like a hundred people like showed up to and like submitted projects to. And then we have, like sponsors and everything. I think that was like really seeing, like the actual like progress happening in 154 00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.390 huda: like 155 00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:11.900 huda: real time was really, really just like it was really validating kind of that like. Oh, so I actually, I can actually make kind of like a hackathon. I can host these things. And 156 00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:20.169 huda: you know, I think now that I have done it once, I could probably like post more hack phones in the future, which is kind of inspirational. But yeah. 157 00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.789 Jenny Duan: Especially because you did literally everything yourself. 158 00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:33.739 Jenny Duan: like it wasn't like, oh, you're like parents helped you or someone else helped you like. You did everything yourself, and that's in just incredible. 159 00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.773 huda: Thank you. 160 00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:40.290 Jenny Duan: So what's next for empowering AI like? What is your next step? What are you planning to do with it? 161 00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:53.010 huda: Okay. So that's we've been talking a little bit with my team. And then we noticed that this event did really well. And so now we have a kind of a discord with like 70 people. Maybe. 162 00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.919 Jenny Duan: Oh, my! Gosh! Incredible! 163 00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:01.569 huda: Yeah. And so we're trying to convert that into like, kind of just our main discord. And so 164 00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:18.206 huda: we wanna like, continue this momentum by having, like more, you know, seminars and workshops. But I've also noticed that maybe those might not do as well. So we might just host, like many, many competitions. See if we can get sponsors on those as well. 165 00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:31.265 huda: cause like, I feel like a lot of people just kind of join for prizes and competition and like honors and stuff. So I think if we do a lot more competitions, I think that could be good from empowering AI and 166 00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:44.010 huda: we we also wanna like in our on our website, we wanna create kind of like a gallery with all the projects. And then also like a website kind of just part of our website will be like displaying information about power hacks. 167 00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.282 huda: But we obviously wanna do this again. So 168 00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.350 huda: I don't think we could do it anytime soon. 169 00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:51.470 huda: but 170 00:20:52.370 --> 00:21:11.366 huda: like organizing another hack found might be good for us. But in the meantime we're thinking of doing like a writing competition where someone can write about like AI ethics or like computer science. And then we can feature them on our website. But then, again, that's kind of like the same thing as our 171 00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.259 huda: AI image generation type thing that we did. And it didn't really do as well. 172 00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.110 Jenny Duan: Oh, how did how did people did people submit to that? 173 00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.859 huda: No, we have, like zeros submissions. 174 00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.470 Jenny Duan: No! Oh. 175 00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.740 huda: Yeah. 176 00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.009 Jenny Duan: What do you think made this Hackathon do so well 177 00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.339 Jenny Duan: because it like 178 00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.630 Jenny Duan: 10 x or 100 x, you know expectations. 179 00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:53.999 huda: I think like, for one like hackathons are a lot more accessible to people. I feel like it's like, like, I feel like if we just do our own separate competition. Which isn't featured online stuff, people can't find it. And then also, like the way we were able to like raise money and stuff I think that really like brought people in 180 00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:11.626 huda: as well as like, I think, cause with what with what we're trying to do with like the AI generation thing is it was kind of based off like an honor thing. But I I don't think anyone really cares about that, especially if it's just like a high school nonprofit. Who's gonna be giving that recognition? So 181 00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:34.430 huda: like, I think, for one, prizes were like way better. Second of all, it was like a like an exclusive event like, oh, it's gonna happen in these 2 days. There's me workshops like it's it was like they're gonna get a lot of benefits. So that's why a lot of people were showing up. But like that, competition might have been more confusing, even like with the guide like people. I don't think people would take the time to do that. 182 00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.730 huda: So that's kind of like. 183 00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.589 huda: and people don't really get the point of it. So that's kind of like one thing as well. 184 00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.453 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. So 185 00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.009 Jenny Duan: also, like the 186 00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.840 Jenny Duan: the 187 00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:59.259 Jenny Duan: So the future of empowering AI. What are you thinking about? So more competitions? What does that look like. And I think that right now, like competition wise. 188 00:22:59.577 --> 00:23:25.279 Jenny Duan: I think now that you've had one successful event like this is something that is like, I think, takes a lot of the pressure off of like trying to get statistics for empowering AI, because now you have, like, you know, something to report back to, but like what's next in terms of competitions? Is there anything in Media that you're planning, or is it? I know you just had this event, and you've been traveling. So it's not like like there has to be something. But like, if you want to brainstorm, or if you have any ideas. We could talk through that. 189 00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.320 huda: Yeah. So 190 00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:35.079 huda: I think this one might. I don't know if it's a great idea. But we could possibly do like an empowering AI website challenge, because. 191 00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.420 Jenny Duan: Oh! What would that be like. 192 00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:46.660 huda: Like right now. So either. So 2 ways you could go about. This is for one we can have like, have like a conversation for someone to design our website, 193 00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:53.160 huda: and then cause just cause, I feel like our current website doesn't really like it doesn't really represent, like the 194 00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:58.609 huda: I guess, like the empowering girls kind of aspect. It's just kind of like a generic website. I feel. 195 00:23:59.018 --> 00:24:04.040 huda: And then another way we could go about. It is kind of have, like. 196 00:24:04.546 --> 00:24:09.929 huda: a theme, or like different themes. And then people to develop a website for it. But yeah. 197 00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:21.010 Jenny Duan: What would you? What do you think the competition would be in that case? Or how would you incentivize people to do that cause? I think, like the issue right now is for the issue in the past with incentives like you talked about right? No one wants this like 198 00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.749 Jenny Duan: recognition, but like people might want prizes from sponsors. 199 00:24:26.311 --> 00:24:31.369 huda: I think we could do similar like fundraising process. I mean, I think 200 00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:39.432 huda: I think like maybe people might not be as receptive as with the hackathon, because there's like the whole Hackathon website. And 201 00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.309 huda: there was like 202 00:24:41.700 --> 00:25:01.950 huda: kind of like, hackathons are a little bit different from different competitions. So maybe you could just like list it as a hackathon like on the Hackathon website and do similar like fundraising type thing to get more sponsors, and this time we could get like different sponsors, like maybe larger brands like figma would be a great one. I know. I've seen like a couple of hackathons which have been sponsored by figma. So 203 00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.340 Jenny Duan: Amazing. 204 00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:09.289 huda: Yeah, if they could, if they could. Sponsor, that would be amazing. Especially since that's really related to web development. 205 00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.510 huda: And then. 206 00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:18.429 huda: yeah, like, just more like web development, specific prices. That would be that'd be really good. But 207 00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:26.809 huda: yeah, like, just thinking, like, so maybe like a mini hack on, you know, like or actually, I think I think like last time 208 00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.509 huda: this morning. 209 00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.250 Jenny Duan: Wars. 210 00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.860 Jenny Duan: Hello! 211 00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:39.845 huda: I? This might be my dad. I'm not sure. 212 00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.160 Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. Hi! How's it going? 213 00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.760 Jenny Duan: I don't know if you can hear me. Yeah, I don't. 214 00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:47.800 huda: Nice, he said. 215 00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.719 huda: I think it's really early in the morning for him. I'm not sure. 216 00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.429 huda: But okay. 217 00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.620 Ivylevel: I hope. 218 00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.520 Ivylevel: Fake. 219 00:26:00.241 --> 00:26:02.350 Jenny Duan: I don't. Maybe it's like a Miss 220 00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.359 Jenny Duan: click. I'm not sure 221 00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.559 Jenny Duan: I just wanna make sure he gets a chance to speak if he wants to speak. 222 00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.209 huda: Oh, yeah, I don't think that's my dad. I don't think that's my dad. 223 00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.720 Jenny Duan: Maybe. Mary, okay. 224 00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.800 Jenny Duan: Okay. 225 00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.809 Ivylevel: I am so sorry I'm having issues with the audio, but it's me. It's Mary. 226 00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.346 Jenny Duan: Okay, no, no worries. 227 00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay. 228 00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.829 Jenny Duan: continue. Continue what you're saying. 229 00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:56.564 huda: Yeah. So actually, towards the end of like the closing ceremony, I was asking, like, our participants and stuff like, what type of a events. Would you be interested in participating in in the future from empowering AI. And a lot of them are saying like kind of long, longer form hackthones so like hackathons, which might like 2 to 3 days, and having like workshops like 2 workshops a day, maybe something like that. And I think that's a pretty good idea. 230 00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:05.380 huda: like, I think if we're able to organize like a smaller, like smaller, but like more widespread hackathon, I think that would be like 231 00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:25.175 huda: that could be our next goal. I think. Yeah, cause like, obviously, like, we don't have to try too hard about metrics. But I think, like these longer term hackathons are definitely like, really good. And also, if we do pay like a little bit of money, we can get featured on like the Dev post site, and then and also. 232 00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.370 Jenny Duan: Featured. 233 00:27:27.237 --> 00:27:32.410 huda: Let me. I think it's like a subscription. But like, I remember, I got an email about it. 234 00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:40.600 huda: and like the people that have been featured have gone like thousands of like participants. So 235 00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:51.618 huda: I think it's deleted actually 236 00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.380 huda: but like. 237 00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.180 huda: actually, I'm not sure but 238 00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.099 huda: yeah, there's, I think I think there's like 239 00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:32.809 huda: it might be a little expensive, but if it isn't, then we'll probably be able to purchase that for our 240 00:28:33.597 --> 00:28:35.112 huda: next competition. 241 00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.950 huda: and then also, maybe, like. 242 00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:47.628 huda: maybe, like with judges, kind of having more official people like our sponsors. I mean, we did have people that like worked at Google and 243 00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.700 huda: like Nvidia. 244 00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.430 huda: But like people from our sponsors kind of talk about what they do would be great. But 245 00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:55.940 huda: anyway. 246 00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.029 huda: yeah, I think it would be a little more organized then. 247 00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.970 huda: But 248 00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.060 huda: yeah. 249 00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.112 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Well, congrats again. And like, that's such a cool opportunity. 250 00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.760 Jenny Duan: and like such cool progress that you've made 251 00:29:12.175 --> 00:29:14.920 Jenny Duan: and like opportunity to keep on growing even more. 252 00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:34.529 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, cool. So I think the next thing that we wanted to talk about. So I feel like empowering. AI is like it's covered like we have some good numbers. It's like covered. Let's talk about Santoria. How is that going? And like any progress on the gaming community publicization, anything that we've mentioned or talked about in the past. 253 00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:44.948 huda: Yeah. So I've been I've been posting something on like different, like indie game development servers. I'm not sure if they've done 2 effectively. 254 00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.420 huda: like, if I go to 255 00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.499 huda: with the analytics for centuria 256 00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.190 huda: I could possibly find out, like how many people played it. But 257 00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.515 huda: so there's only been like 410 plays so far. 258 00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.830 huda: But yeah, I've been like. 259 00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:11.160 Jenny Duan: Where, in the. 260 00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.620 huda: Trying to. 261 00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.340 Jenny Duan: It's like that's still a significant number, though. But I see what you mean. 262 00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.608 huda: Yeah, I mean, I think I've I've been trying to like 263 00:30:22.775 --> 00:30:26.519 huda: like putting it up on like discords. And then 264 00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:27.480 huda: like 265 00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:37.383 huda: I've been trying a little bit with tick tock. Not as much, though. I've been like trying to make more on like generic tiktok like tech tiktoks, but 266 00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.809 Jenny Duan: I saw you got a lot of hate for no reason what happened there. 267 00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.210 huda: Yeah, I, just. 268 00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.270 Jenny Duan: I did. 269 00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:52.690 huda: My Tiktok like reached the wrong side of like tick, Tock, and it just kind of like reached like the voice side of Tiktok. 270 00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.230 huda: I'm sorry. I think I'm losing our voice. 271 00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:57.060 Jenny Duan: Oh, it wasn't. 272 00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:57.820 huda: Games. 273 00:30:58.890 --> 00:30:59.730 huda: One second. 274 00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:22.640 huda: But yeah, basically, like, I did a video about like how like, a lot of things weren't like made for women. And then there was, like everyone complaining about 275 00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:30.514 huda: like why do you want something designed specifically for women like they're just like hating like, really hard. And then 276 00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:37.319 huda: like, I turn off the comments. But yeah, I just kinda kept making videos after that. 277 00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.269 Jenny Duan: Has your account gained more followers since then? 278 00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.329 huda: Yeah, it's it's only around at around like 60. I started off with like. 279 00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:46.900 huda: like 280 00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.494 huda: 40 before that video. So I got kind of like 20 from that video. But then 281 00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.850 Jenny Duan: I think it's so like she talks such like a 282 00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.949 Jenny Duan: hard platform to crack. It's a really hard. 283 00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.740 huda: So, yeah. 284 00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:15.340 Jenny Duan: Like what? Okay? I've like made Tiktoks in like high school, and I made them every day, and I never got any followers. And then in college, like I randomly just started making tiktoks, and it like got me so many fo well, not so many, but like I just started gaining followers at a faster rate. So I just, I feel like Tiktok is just so. 285 00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.099 Jenny Duan: I don't know. It's like it's difficult to crack. 286 00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.280 huda: Yeah. 287 00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:31.940 Jenny Duan: But yeah, okay, I think the goal should still be to get more people playing synthoria. Are you still like publishing it? A lot on Linkedin, and things, too. I feel like your Linkedin's also been popping off. Can't lie. 288 00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.126 huda: I don't know. I I don't think I've put been posting on Linkedin too much. I wanna say 289 00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.649 huda: like I have been kind of like doing that. But then 290 00:32:44.027 --> 00:32:47.149 huda: I feel like I've been a bit inactive. But 291 00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.990 huda: anyway, I think I wanna I wanna do like a lot of new posts, for 292 00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.980 huda: in power hacks. 293 00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.719 Jenny Duan: Okay, and so what posts are you envisioning. 294 00:33:02.163 --> 00:33:05.319 huda: Let me put in the chat like what I wrote so far. 295 00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.500 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 296 00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:44.830 Jenny Duan: Okay. 297 00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.850 Jenny Duan: that looks good. 298 00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.540 Jenny Duan: That looks really good. You should post that. 299 00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:10.831 huda: Okay, thank you. I was like, I have to do like a lot of so I have like a lot of footage and stuff from like the hackathon. So I was planning on posting like a lot about it. So this is just the one for, like 1st place. And then we're gonna post one for second place and 3rd place, 300 00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:21.880 huda: And then I wanted to make like shorts or like Youtube shorts and like Instagram reels for like the judges panel. I think that would be like, I think that's like viral content. But 301 00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.590 huda: yeah, it might take me some time to edit. But yeah. 302 00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.026 Jenny Duan: Got it? 303 00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:30.889 Jenny Duan: And 304 00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:43.849 Jenny Duan: as to what you're like planning to do for centuria other than social media, how are you in Linkedin? How are you planning on like publicizing even more? Is there anything I can do to like support on that end? 305 00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.489 huda: So 306 00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.800 huda: I think 307 00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.100 huda: I think 308 00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.380 huda: if I if I'm able to like, reach out to more youtubers. That would be good. 309 00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:56.890 huda: I think 310 00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:00.995 huda: that's a good idea, but I've never like gotten response back. 311 00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.530 Jenny Duan: Can you hear? 312 00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.051 huda: But, like, I feel like that will be really effective. 313 00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:18.580 huda: I can try like like mailing, more cause. I don't think I've like mailed that many youtubers to get any responses back. But I think I that's worth the try. 314 00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:24.110 Jenny Duan: Okay. And then, are you publishing like, I feel like Satura would be good for, like 315 00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:30.080 Jenny Duan: elementary middle schoolers, low key, like young people. But how do you reach that audience? 316 00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.120 huda: I mean, I think I could post it and like 317 00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.594 huda: our community like Facebook group 318 00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.462 huda: like, I don't know how much, how good. That'll do, cause we don't have that big of a community. But 319 00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.789 huda: nonetheless, I think that could bring in a few people 320 00:35:49.516 --> 00:35:53.619 huda: cause there's like a lot of parents in there, and they could like maybe tell their kids to play 321 00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:56.830 huda: And then 322 00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:01.678 huda: I feel like any like Facebook group like I can join some like random ones. 323 00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.220 huda: maybe like about education. 324 00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:13.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And it it hasn't really taken. Have you started pitching it to those indie like game development newsletters that we talked about before. 325 00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:17.748 huda: I I don't think so. 326 00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.999 Jenny Duan: Do you want? Is that something that you feel like is feasible? Is that difficult? 327 00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.073 huda: Yeah, hold on. Let me check, cause I I don't really remember this. 328 00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:32.359 Jenny Duan: I don't think we've talked about specific newsletters. I think we've just like discussed it in passing. 329 00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.610 huda: Oh, okay, yeah. If we could like, find some that might be. 330 00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.923 Jenny Duan: Okay, why don't we look at that right now? 331 00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.410 Jenny Duan: video game, do you go? 332 00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.499 Jenny Duan: okay, I'm gonna start linking some newsletters. 333 00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:56.690 Jenny Duan: Oh. 334 00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.596 huda: Sorry. I think I was like talking, but I think I was muted. But. 335 00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:00.920 Jenny Duan: Sorry I didn't. Didn't. 336 00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.525 huda: No 337 00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:11.256 huda: So for folklift there's like 2 founders and they reached out to me, asking if I was able to like, read an article about them. So right now. 338 00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.070 Jenny Duan: Eric. 339 00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.608 huda: Yeah, I've they reached out to me on Linkedin. So 340 00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:22.439 huda: I think they found me through that. And then I'm just like working on the interview right now. But 341 00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:27.310 huda: yeah, like, I'm hoping to add them to like our businesses. Kind of side. 342 00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.640 Jenny Duan: What type of 343 00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.969 Jenny Duan: game or sorry I'm confused. What type of business are they. 344 00:38:34.135 --> 00:38:58.919 huda: So one of them is like they fund like nonprofits and stuff. And then, before they had, like a all female forming like a board, and then she just updated me that it's no longer all female. So then, instead, we're kind of refocusing it on like her journey as like a female founder, and like how she's been able to avoid Ops from the stuff. That's the kind of like questions I've been asking the interview. 345 00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:06.430 huda: but like, yeah, like, once she's done, I'm gonna be able to add her into like the social impact. 346 00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.860 huda: small businesses. 347 00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:15.240 Jenny Duan: How is full hook going other than that? Also, I'm like, I added, a couple of Indie game newsletters. 348 00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.059 Jenny Duan: I feel like you can take a look at. 349 00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:21.662 huda: Oh, those look good 350 00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.210 huda: In terms of folklift. 351 00:39:24.526 --> 00:39:30.413 huda: I don't think it's I feel like that's like, kind of all the updates I have. I feel like it's not going as 352 00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.009 huda: well as the other sharks. 353 00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:41.070 Jenny Duan: Okay, so let's think about how we can make it go better. So I mean, I've been seeing your social media posts, too. Like, where are you sourcing those articles from? 354 00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.790 huda: Yeah. Oh, I'm running a couple of articles like I wrote the one about Nikki Haley, 355 00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.549 huda: and I'm trying to be a little more active on our sub stack 356 00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.470 huda: and then also our medium. So like 357 00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:01.350 huda: I don't that I don't know if we have a significant enough like analytics for that. But 358 00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:06.540 huda: it has been. I've been creating like a little bit more content for folklift in that way. 359 00:40:07.457 --> 00:40:09.280 huda: And then, like 360 00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:17.322 huda: the vice president that I got from like India. She's working on a couple of like small business interviews right now. 361 00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.260 huda: So there's like, gonna be like 3 to 4 more 362 00:40:21.607 --> 00:40:34.379 huda: Indian small businesses, but like I think, my outreach for this one isn't as good and but actually like. Now that I think about it. There's like a couple of like nonprofits that have been like liking or empowering AI 363 00:40:34.783 --> 00:40:38.330 huda: like posts which are kind of similar to folklift. 364 00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:44.750 huda: And then I think I I could like possibly like, reach out to them and see if they want to do a collaboration or something like that. 365 00:40:45.265 --> 00:40:45.770 huda: Okay. 366 00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:49.960 Jenny Duan: When is, did you reach out to the J camp alumni? This is like, kind of a 367 00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.090 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 368 00:40:51.851 --> 00:40:58.138 huda: I actually got on a call with one of them, and they said they weren't like allowed to like, give too much information. But 369 00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:03.069 huda: yeah, cause they're like, right now, they're like a rising freshman college. So they don't have like 370 00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.400 huda: any advice like solid advice. But 371 00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.659 huda: yeah, like, you're still like, really insightful like. 372 00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:14.344 huda: they said, to do like a lot of research before J. Camp. 373 00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.200 huda: yeah. 374 00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:19.950 Jenny Duan: Wow! 375 00:41:20.515 --> 00:41:23.570 Jenny Duan: And so like, what does that mean for you like 376 00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.600 Jenny Duan: in terms of in terms of like 377 00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:36.749 Jenny Duan: maximizing your impact in full flood, and being a self publicist, did you ask them about that? For, like starting your own journalism, or being a more involved journalism in your personal life. 378 00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:47.699 huda: Yeah. I asked them a little bit of tips of like a few tips on like journalism in general. And then she gave me a little bit of advice on like how to 379 00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:52.050 huda: like to write better is like, write something that you are more passionate about 380 00:41:52.361 --> 00:41:54.470 huda: and she gave me like kind of 381 00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:00.238 huda: like advice on writing. So I don't think I was like really specific about like what to do. 382 00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.610 huda: She's gonna be attending Csu. Fullerton. 383 00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:10.040 huda: And she said, she's not really like pursuing journalism in general. Like she's doing communications. So 384 00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.619 huda: it's like kinda similar. 385 00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:17.249 huda: Well, like, yeah, she doesn't like the one person that I met with was like. 386 00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:23.669 huda: I'm like the other people. They are. I'm gonna meeting. I'm meeting one person. This weekend 387 00:42:24.439 --> 00:42:28.639 huda: over zoom, but like she's the one that goes to Princeton. So 388 00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:40.389 huda: Yeah, I'm excited to talk to her cause. She's like, really into journalism and stuff. And I, it's really valuable to get like that kind of advice. But yeah, so insightful. 389 00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:42.769 Jenny Duan: What is Jacamp? Again? What are the dates. 390 00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.150 huda: It's august 3rd to August 9.th 391 00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.180 Jenny Duan: Are you ready. 392 00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.064 huda: I'm really scared. Cause 1st of all, like, 393 00:42:53.447 --> 00:42:54.939 huda: yeah. And then. 394 00:42:55.190 --> 00:43:08.053 huda: 1st of all, like, they're like dressing like, it's like, really strict, like it has to be like not too baggy, not too tight like they have, like a whole checklist. About like what we can bring and then. 395 00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.959 Jenny Duan: Otherwise, why do you need to be dressed in certain way? I don't understand. 396 00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.530 huda: We have to be business casual and then like. 397 00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.424 huda: And then it's kind of like specific, like 398 00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.780 huda: like, for example. 399 00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:29.059 huda: It can't like. If you wear like skirts, they can be like too short or too long, or like I don't know. It's just like a whole. 400 00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:34.020 Jenny Duan: Why? Why cause you're meeting important people or just cause they're picky for no reason. 401 00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:43.455 huda: Yeah, I think it's cause we're gonna be like meeting important people. And then like, we're also gonna like they're gonna have like videos and stuff. And they wanna maybe make it look more professional. Maybe. 402 00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.250 Jenny Duan: That makes sense, I guess. 403 00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:53.599 huda: Yeah, but but yeah, they did tell us, like, 2 locations we're gonna be going to and like, possibly reporting at 404 00:43:54.170 --> 00:44:01.689 huda: And so they told us to kind of do like a little bit of research, and come up with like 2 headlines or like article pitches 405 00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:04.090 huda: and like, send it beforehand. 406 00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:06.530 huda: And so that's kinda like, that's kinda scary. 407 00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.630 huda: But yeah. 408 00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:26.320 Jenny Duan: I'm so happy for you. It's going to be such a good experience, I think, and if anything, hopefully, the travel and the hackathon has taught you that you're so you're capable of so much, and you're going to meet even cooler people who can push you to grow even more. So that's going to be so exciting. And hopefully, there, you can get some insight onto, like 409 00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.910 Jenny Duan: how to 410 00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:30.370 Jenny Duan: get more people to read your journalism. 411 00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.120 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 412 00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.400 huda: For me, and. 413 00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.104 Jenny Duan: In and of itself. 414 00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.360 Jenny Duan: I think, for folklift. 415 00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:38.960 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 416 00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.909 Jenny Duan: how else can you publicize folklift? 417 00:44:42.486 --> 00:44:43.580 Jenny Duan: Does your 418 00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.589 Jenny Duan: journalism, teacher? Would they have any resources. Do you think. 419 00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:54.240 Jenny Duan: To help you? Or would they have any like ideas? Do you know, or do you think. 420 00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.868 huda: I mean, they have like a school newspaper. 421 00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.870 huda: So maybe like 422 00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:07.072 huda: I don't know if we'd be able to get featured on that. But that could possibly won't be one way. 423 00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.350 Jenny Duan: Try. 424 00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.519 huda: Yeah, I think I'll I'll I think I'll ask. When school starts again. 425 00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:16.460 Jenny Duan: Why not try? Is it? Is there people like managing it now? 426 00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.619 huda: No, it's like part of the class. 427 00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.070 Jenny Duan: Raja. 428 00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.789 Jenny Duan: Is there any other local news that you could try to pitch it to 429 00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.329 Jenny Duan: like Mountain House news? 430 00:45:32.275 --> 00:45:32.750 huda: Yeah. 431 00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:33.570 Jenny Duan: Paper. 432 00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:39.930 huda: There's there's 1 like really local, like a mountain house mountain. I think 433 00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.016 huda: I think I could pitch the idea to them, and I think 434 00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:47.460 huda: like my friend, has like a contact to one of the head journalists. So 435 00:45:47.794 --> 00:45:51.779 huda: I can ask if they'd be able to give that to me, but. 436 00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:57.529 Jenny Duan: You can even ask the byline, or like a guest newspap like a guest feature, or something like that. 437 00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:00.175 huda: Yeah, that would be interesting. 438 00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:06.819 huda: and maybe like I could write like an OP. Ed about like Mount House. Maybe that would be cool. 439 00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.269 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Why not? 440 00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.989 Jenny Duan: That seems really cool. 441 00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:19.410 huda: Yeah, I think I could. That was pretty interesting. I think I'll I'll reach out to Manhattan for that. 442 00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:30.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because when you elevate your own journalism, I feel like that also adds credibility to like Full cliff, because you can tie those things in together like your independent journalism. And you're like work with Full cliff, too. 443 00:46:32.814 --> 00:46:34.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds great. 444 00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.699 Jenny Duan: And then finally. 445 00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:44.889 Jenny Duan: I think those are like all the main extracurricular items I wanted to like, talk about if you like. 446 00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:55.979 Jenny Duan: have started something new cause. I remember we, before we were trying to like fill in a couple of more steps.

So I think it turned out that the the kind of program that I said about like the council. It was like too late. 452 00:47:17.685 --> 00:47:21.949 huda: I might like contact them again if they still have like time. 453 00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:28.739 huda: But yeah, like, I'll try that. But then, also, I was like going to apply for the 454 00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:37.299 huda: reboot like. I don't know if it's open to high scores, but like I think I think last time you mentioned, there's like a like a newspaper about like 455 00:47:37.711 --> 00:47:41.648 huda: computer science, and like AI and stuff, it was called like Reboot or something. 456 00:47:42.437 --> 00:47:50.450 huda: And then I think I could, I think I should apply to that, I think. Yeah. But then I don't know if it's like open to high schools, but 457 00:47:51.081 --> 00:47:54.949 huda: still, like their editorial board, or like, maybe they're publicizing teams. 458 00:47:54.950 --> 00:48:00.330 Jenny Duan: Well, you should apply for reboot, I think, as long as you have like legit work it should be fine. 459 00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:01.610 Jenny Duan: which you do 460 00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.349 Jenny Duan: like as long as you're able to qualify what you do, it's totally, I think it should be totally fine. 461 00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:13.369 huda: Yeah, okay? And then, so yeah, I think that's something that I'm gonna apply for. See if 462 00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.440 huda: I'd be able to get a position in that. 463 00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.220 huda: And then. 464 00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:29.720 huda: yeah, I'm kind of bummed. I missed out on that like AI Council thing, but I think I can. I can try again. 465 00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:34.480 Jenny Duan: Okay, are there any other opportunities that you're you currently have in queue. 466 00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:43.850 huda: I'm not sure, I think, like the encode justice slack is like pretty good. So I let me check that to see if there's anything 467 00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.249 huda: I can find. 468 00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:45.090 huda: okay, I think, like it hasn't been updated yet, but 469 00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:46.620 huda: no worries. 470 00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:48.600 huda: Also. 471 00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.730 huda: I think the Nc. Witt 472 00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:59.360 huda: they were like holding a they they were holding like some sort of like Education board. I think we talked about this before, but like 473 00:49:59.814 --> 00:50:08.635 huda: they're holding some sort of like Education Board, and then like a meeting conference type thing. And then they were looking for like panelists. Where's high school students? 474 00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:09.610 Jenny Duan: Whoa! 475 00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:10.570 huda: So. 476 00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:34.860 huda: yeah, I applied to that. They like they had. They were, they replied. And they're like, Okay, yeah, we'd love to have you speaking? The timing kind of conflicts with J. Camp? But like I might be able to like record a video or like try to zoom in there. But yeah, they haven't. I'm not sure how that's going yet. But yeah. 477 00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:51.970 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So just to kind of reiterate the current extracurriculars that you have or that you're working on are obviously impairing AI Folklift centuria. Right? This is like the 3. And then filmmakers club. 478 00:50:52.480 --> 00:51:01.999 Jenny Duan: You have them volunteering at the mosque like Sunday School. You have j campus Classy. And then, what am I missing?

By the way. 489 00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.360 huda: It's going well, I actually I kind of like 490 00:51:50.520 --> 00:52:03.780 huda: so during, like the empower hacks, I actually held a workshop. By women and games. So it was like, kind of like the slide set was from like women and games. And I was talking about like 491 00:52:04.205 --> 00:52:23.730 huda: game development and like, why, it's important to have like female characters, and like female, like like game developers and kind of like how to think like a feminist when it comes with game development. And then that was like kind of like one of the workshops. So I think that's something I could add under like the description for women and games, ambassadorship. 492 00:52:24.071 --> 00:52:30.360 huda: And then, like, yeah, so that was like one event that I did under women and games. But yeah. 493 00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.479 Jenny Duan: That's really cool. And then finally. 494 00:52:34.901 --> 00:52:41.829 Jenny Duan: for Muslim youth, North America.

I was wondering if I was like eligible, and then also 498 00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:56.929 huda: And then also, like, I'm not sure 499 00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:02.650 huda: like I just kind of. I think I filled out one of them, and then I didn't get any responses as well. 500 00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:03.980 huda: But 501 00:53:04.446 --> 00:53:09.970 huda: I think I should. It's never worth like another shot, and seeing if they'd like reply for follow up. 502 00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.100 Jenny Duan: You should like. 503 00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.639 Jenny Duan: See if you can, you wanna go to their convention or volunteer for it. 504 00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.223 huda: Yeah, that would be. 505 00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:24.850 huda: do you think like going to like one of their conferences like, do you think that would like 506 00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:28.290 huda: be kind of qualified to. 507 00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:32.329 huda: so that we can actually like put it in the extra curricular list, or. 508 00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:37.669 Jenny Duan: i i i think so.

Wanna send some time like getting into a common app mode because we're entering that period. So I think, like, I want that to be the focus of next time's meeting.

Do you feel like you're on a good track for the next couple of days?

And maybe like the wording like wording my po post. 566 00:59:56.810 --> 01:00:03.120 Jenny Duan: Viral Linkedin are just like the most cringe things like the like, very unserious. 567 01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:10.209 Jenny Duan: like someone's like goes viral because he's like, Oh, like I reach Level 100 and heyday or something random. 568 01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.140 Jenny Duan: So, yeah. 569 01:00:14.013 --> 01:00:17.900 huda: Maybe I could try that tactic as well. But yeah. 570 01:00:18.995 --> 01:00:29.360 huda: so if you get like, kind of if I can send over some of like the post I'm gonna do. And then, if you could like, kind of check and see if they're fine, that'd be great. 571 01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.290 Jenny Duan: Cool sounds, good. 572 01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:36.749 huda: But yeah, that's kind of it, for now.

How is London? And are you not going to India, or is, is it your dad going? But you're not. 4 00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:23.680 huda: Yeah, it's just it's just gonna be my dad. But London was so fun it was. It was really cool, like, we went to a lot of museums and my brother really enjoyed them especially. But yeah, it was really cool like this. The everything was like so different from America, like well, there was just like the scenery, and then and then, like even like everything is historical. So it's like cool cause, if you like. If even if you go to like a random village, it's gonna be like 5 00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:35.510 huda: years old, like decades old. But yeah, that was that was pretty interesting. Yeah. My dad's just off to India. As like an emergency visit. But. 6 00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.250 Jenny Duan: Oh, is everything okay? Is is it okay? 7 00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.180 huda: Yeah, it's just like one of our relatives aren't feeling so well. So. 8 00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.770 Jenny Duan: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. 9 00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.189 Jenny Duan: When was the last time you were in India? 10 00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.240 huda: Like 11 00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.069 huda: 11 to 12 years ago. 12 00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.109 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh! When are you gonna be back to India? 13 00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.810 Jenny Duan: That seems like a really long time. 14 00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.459 huda: Yeah, I really wanna go. I was thinking, like, maybe summer after senior year. But I don't know for sure. 15 00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:14.720 Jenny Duan: Hmm, makes a lot of sense. But yeah, tell me more abou",
    "t London, like, what was I mean? I know you've been wanting to do this for a long time, so like what were the highlights, the museums? Your brother liked it like everything's historical. What else. 16 00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.632 huda: I also really liked. 17 00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:32.780 huda: I mean, okay. So one time we went on kind of like a day trip. It was a bit hectic and like the weather, was kind of less hot than California. So that was kind of good thing, but the same time it was like raining a lot. So that's 1 thing I didn't like. 18 00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:48.899 huda: But we're on this like day trip. Outside of like London. And there was like all these like different places, like like Windsor's. We got to the Windsor Castle. We got to see this small town called Bath, I think like a lot of the like. The Richardson. 19 00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.920 huda: Oh, it was like shot there, so that was pretty cool to see. 20 00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.200 Jenny Duan: Really cool. 21 00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:56.329 huda: And yeah, we just got to see, like. 22 00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.640 huda: I'm pretty sure, we got to see i'm, not sure, if it was actually like one of the wonders of the world. But there was one place called like the Stone Hedge. It was really cool. 23 00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.390 Jenny Duan: Oh, my stone head is so famous! Oh. 24 00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.810 Jenny Duan: cool. 25 00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.460 huda: Yeah, it was really cool. And I I got to bring my camera. So I did lots of photography there. And yeah, it was really nice. 26 00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.310 Jenny Duan: That's so amazing. I'm glad that you had a really good time, and you got back. And you hosted the hackathon. So how was that. 27 00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:52.340 huda: That was definitely like, really, really, really hectic, I think even more hectic than like the London trip. I think. It was planning everything cause you know. The week we got back was a week before the hacka",
    "thon, and then like a lot of like the sponsors were backing out. And then there was like judges who weren't being responsive and like, there's like a bunch of like issues with that like last minute. So then, there's a lot of like. 28 00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:15.840 huda: especially for the judges. I just like posted it everywhere, like on the Ncwt. Slack on the encode. Justice slack on like the code with clossy channel like I, I found judges like in the last minute, to be honest and then we like finalized all the sponsors, and then marketing. And I, I feel like everything was basically done on last week, like we did do lots of preparation like we got our sponsors and everything like 29 00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.929 huda: before we went on the trip. But then it was just like even even like everything just sped up in the last week. 30 00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:34.378 huda: But then, in terms of the actual hackathon. I think it was like a really good experience. I think it was a bit hectic, because that we had to like, wake up early to practice the opening ceremony. We had to. 31 00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:45.260 huda: you know, attend every single workshop, and like kind of record everything, and make sure. They're go running smoothly. And then we have to be like online the entire time, so that we can answer questions. 32 00:04:45.260 --> 00:05:04.675 huda: But I mean, I think it was a fun experience, because it was like nice kind of like hosting a hackathon for once, cause I kind of remember like being like part of a hackathon and like how the organizers were really helpful. So I really wanted to kind of do that with empower hacks as well. And then also I just I feel like it was bit 33 00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.959 huda: like I feel like 34 00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:25.059 huda: with my team. They weren't doing as much which I kind of understand, because it's kind of like as like the President, I have this responsibility that I have to kind of be in charge of things. But yeah, i",
    "t was kind of like it felt that there's like a lot of pressure on me as well. So I did have to do like 35 00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:40.769 huda: kind of go and get some testimonials, hop on calls with some teams and kind of like check in with everyone. And everyone else is kind of not doing as much. And then I did a lot of the screen recordings as well, but I guess that it is my responsibility. So yeah. 36 00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:42.849 huda: other than that. 37 00:05:44.310 --> 00:06:09.009 huda: Oh, sorry other than that. Like it was, it was really nice. And then we learned I learned a lot of things throughout this hackathon like, for example, right after the hackathon. I had to like, create certificates for everyone, and kind of send those out and kind of like that process because I didn't really think about like certificates and like sending out emails. And that process. So that was like something new that I learned. And then 38 00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:16.250 huda: also, like Dev post has this feature where it has, where, like you can see, like the metrics of your hackathon 39 00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:42.029 huda: and then I learned that that features like really nice, because I was able to create like a Google sheets. And then I was able to find, like the total amount of countries, the total amount of cities that participated and then, even like the average skill level like cause, one of the questions was like, Oh, on a scale of 10, like, what's your skill level. And then, we're able to find that statistic. And that's gonna be like pretty helpful when we're marketing it afterwards. 40 00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:54.469 huda: So I think I did learn a lot from this hackathon. I think it was overall really great experience. A little bit like too much pressure. But I mean I enjoyed it? Towards the end. Yeah. 41 00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.830 Jenny Duan: That's amazing. Yeah, again, like, super happy for you. That sounds 42 00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.380 Jenny Duan: like a really",
    " good time. And like. 43 00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:15.400 Jenny Duan: it just seems like a really good learning experience overall and like, how many people do you have the metrics? For, like how many people showed up, you said, like some sponsors backed out. How many sponsors you have like? How many judges did you have? Do you have any numbers there. 44 00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.460 huda: Yeah, so we have 4 sponsors. 45 00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:45.090 huda: And then in total, we're about, we are able to raise $23,000 and prizes. And that's including, like the different subscriptions. And then the different yeah, like the domain names and other stuff that we got provided. So in total, like, everything was basically sponsored by like our sponsors. But then, like the top, 3 prizes were sponsored by our team. 46 00:07:45.090 --> 00:08:00.350 huda: and which they weren't really like too much of a prize pool like. We just provided like, maybe, like a gaming keyboard and a gaming mouse, and then, like a Bluetooth speaker like we provided those small things, and then the other prizes were kind of provided by our sponsors. 47 00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:04.860 huda: And then, in terms of like other metrics, there were like. 48 00:08:05.228 --> 00:08:10.999 huda: there's like around a hundred people that showed up there was like, like, basically a hundred. So it was like. 49 00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:24.870 huda: like 95, that kind of like range. But and then there's like people from 4 different continents, 16 different countries. And like, I think it was 50 00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.050 huda: like 51 00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.320 huda: 40, 46 different cities. 52 00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.790 Jenny Duan: Would you be able to capture? Wait, can you? 53 00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:37.499 Jenny Duan: Can we like? Okay, I'm gonna write down all of these statistics. So how many people total. 54 00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.919 huda: So like around a hundred, yeah. 55 00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.032 Je",
    "nny Duan: Okay? And then 56 00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:44.709 Jenny Duan: the price pool is 23,000. Right? Yeah. 57 00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.000 huda: That's a little over that actually. 58 00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.819 Jenny Duan: Wow! How many? Judges? 59 00:08:49.631 --> 00:08:52.700 huda: There were 6, I think. Let me double check. 60 00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.839 Jenny Duan: Switches. Okay? 61 00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:05.699 huda: There's 7. Actually sorry. 62 00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:12.259 Jenny Duan: 7 judges around, 100 participants from. And you were saying they were from how many different countries. 63 00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:14.550 huda: They were from. 64 00:09:15.449 --> 00:09:17.909 huda: Let me double check, I said. 65 00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.780 huda: Okay, it looks like 66 00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.380 huda: from 16 different countries. 67 00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:25.925 Jenny Duan: Okay. 68 00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.900 Jenny Duan: 16 different countries. And then you were saying, what else. 69 00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.799 huda: And around like 46 different cities. 70 00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:43.779 huda: and then on a scale of 10, the average experience level over Hackathon. Like participants was 5. 71 00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:45.679 huda: Yeah. 5. 72 00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.580 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's it. 73 00:09:52.256 --> 00:09:54.690 huda: And then that's kind of 74 00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.829 huda: all the statistics that we're able to get from that. 75 00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.110 huda: But then, like I mean. 76 00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:16.820 huda: it does. I don't think this is really means anything. But there's like, they're from 4 different continents. Yeah. And then we also saw from, like our data, that there was actually some people that found out about our hackathon from their college, and that was like pretty interesting. 77 00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.620 Jenny Duan: Oh, how did you get that data. 78 00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:31.519 huda: So",
    " like that post has like when you're signing up, it kinda asks you like, oh, where'd you find out about empower hacks? And then you can like find that. And then the person is actually from Algeria, which is pretty interesting, that. 79 00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.040 Jenny Duan: There, and. 80 00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.150 huda: You know how. 81 00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.840 Jenny Duan: That's like, who knows? That's so cool like 82 00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:45.009 Jenny Duan: that, like you should be so proud of yourself like this is incredible that you got so many people to sign out from so many different parts of the world like. 83 00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.299 Jenny Duan: you know, like that's really cool. How many workshops that you have total. 84 00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:53.220 huda: We had around like 4, including the judges, panel. 85 00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.719 Jenny Duan: And then how many do you know how many submissions you got. 86 00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.190 huda: We got 20 submissions. 87 00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.470 Jenny Duan: Pretty good. 88 00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:08.669 Jenny Duan: That's actually like pretty good, considering, like 100 people. Did you get to look through the submissions like, did anyone make anything that you thought was really cool. 89 00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:26.308 huda: Yeah, I think so. Our winning project was called Code. Her. I think that was like, honestly one of like the best projects I've seen in a while, and especially considering like her hackathon, was only 27 h, and then the yeah. So the the girl she like built 90 00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.599 huda: Oh, yeah, let me share 91 00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:50.550 huda: it was, I don't. I don't know how like open it, I think. There's like a demo video. But it's like she basically had like an AI like. 92 00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:52.979 Jenny Duan: You need to get more Google drive store. 93 00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.109 huda: Yeah, it's we're putting all the recordings on there. 94 0",
    "0:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.070 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's probably why, okay. 95 00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.780 Jenny Duan: okay. 96 00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.109 Jenny Duan: can. So can you explain that she uses an AI? What. 97 00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.153 huda: Oh, can you hear the audio? I think she's explaining better. 98 00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.469 Jenny Duan: Share any audio? And did you share screen audio. 99 00:12:15.346 --> 00:12:16.700 huda: Oh, okay. 100 00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.369 Jenny Duan: I don't know if I can hear anything still. 101 00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.879 Jenny Duan: and I can't hear you speaking. If you're talking. 102 00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:39.540 Jenny Duan: There we go! 103 00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:41.710 Jenny Duan: Oh. 104 00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.420 huda: Oh, okay. 105 00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.819 huda: I'll just explain it. I guess I don't know. 106 00:12:46.970 --> 00:13:09.430 huda: It's not like it's asking me like on my password or something. It's not working. But basically it's like, it has a bunch of aspects. It like has, like a AI Chatbot, which can speak in like many different languages. And it helps you like, learn coding skills and like and it helps kind of give opportunities like recommend opportunities for women in tech. 107 00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:26.819 huda: And then it also has, like a bunch of resources like that's another aspect. And then there's also, like, a kind of networking page where it shows, like different women to network with like coding stars, as they call it. But yeah, it's it's really cool. I'm I'm very impressed by. 108 00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.950 Jenny Duan: No, I'm 27 h too. 109 00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:36.990 huda: Yeah.

    "ood turnout, especially for a 113 00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.970 Jenny Duan: especially for a virtual hackathon, too. 114 00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.970 huda: Yeah. 115 00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:09.980 Jenny Duan: You know, like people chose to do this like they chose to be there and spend their time doing your hackathon like no one, forced them to like they chose to be there, and that's just awesome. 116 00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.884 huda: Yeah, it was. It was really nice. Cause like, the people were also like participating. So 117 00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:34.992 huda: as part of our hackathon they were like. There's like a challenge we did. It's called the Content challenge. And then they were basically either make memes or like make reels and stuff documenting their like coding journey, and then they'd get like a free domain name as like one of our sponsors. And then 118 00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:54.879 huda: And so, like a lot of people submitted to that which we're planning on sharing like on Linkedin and like Instagram and stuff. But yeah, that was like, I think our challenge like was really interactive. And a lot a lot of people do. We're doing stuff for like the prizes. But that was so. That was so like really cool that a lot of people were interested. 119 00:14:55.496 --> 00:14:56.089 huda: That's okay. 120 00:14:56.416 --> 00:14:59.350 Jenny Duan: Also, your social media has been popping off recently. 121 00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:05.189 Jenny Duan: like I saw ton of new followers, and like it's been, I see, like all the comments. 122 00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:20.659 huda: Yeah, yeah, we've been.

    " awesome. 125 00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.489 huda: I don't know if it would be able to answer this question. But 126 00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:49.140 huda: yeah, it's pretty. It's really cool. For, like like an AI developed in like 27 h. It's pretty cool. 127 00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.370 Jenny Duan: This is the Chat Gpt. Wrapper. 128 00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.830 huda: not sure. 129 00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.430 Jenny Duan: Where are they? 130 00:15:58.744 --> 00:15:59.060 huda: Link. 131 00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.290 Jenny Duan: No AI! 132 00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.790 huda: Oh, and there's also like a game in it. It's pretty cool. 133 00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.170 Jenny Duan: Oh! 134 00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.670 huda: I'm not sure it's probably like in here, or something. 135 00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.340 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 136 00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.769 Jenny Duan: yeah. I mean, it's it doesn't matter. That's like awesome, though. 137 00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.770 huda: Yeah, yeah, it was like, it's really impressive. 138 00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:37.289 huda: And we have like a lot of some of these weren't really related to women in tech cause. I think people just join just to submit and see if they'd win. 139 00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.380 huda: But, like it's still like 140 00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:54.210 huda: there's still like a lot of good ones which we gave honorable mentions like this is actually the people's like 1st time coding and like ha! Being in my hackathon and as well as this one like this person's 1st hackathon. 141 00:16:54.775 --> 00:17:09.850 huda: These people are like from like Ucla and Ucsd, there's it's pretty cool. And there's actually this one is like, really interesting. Cause there's like someone from Turkey. There's someone who yeah. And there's someone who studied Georg at Georgia, tech 142 00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:15.169 huda: and then and there's someone who study at Stanford. So that's really cool. 143 00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.971 Jenny ",
    "Duan: Oh, my God! We you literally got a Stanford student to S to participate in your hackathon. 144 00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.880 huda: Like. 145 00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.550 Jenny Duan: Isn't that amazing like? Think about it. 146 00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:39.470 huda: Yeah, and it was it was really nice cause she was able to like kind of she or I asked her like, how's your experience going? She's like, Oh, it's going really. Well. I really love how you guys have organized things, those it's kind of validating to see that other people are enjoying it. But yeah. 147 00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.590 Jenny Duan: That's really cool. Did you send out a feedback survey at the end. 148 00:17:43.370 --> 00:18:12.049 huda: Yeah, it was also like it was kind of like a like. I went to individual groups and then I hopped on like a call with them. And then I I did like a screen recording, and then I asked them a couple of questions about empower hacks, and then I asked them if they could kind of show off their project a little bit, and I hope to like it might take me a while to edit. But I'm thinking of like kind of doing a compilation of like the different testimonials and seeing like and kind of showing 149 00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.210 huda: kind of doing like a conclusion. Video of empower hacks. Yeah. 150 00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:24.639 Jenny Duan: That's really awesome. Do you feel like it was a gratifying experience. I know you put so much work into it like even that. That banner. You designed that right? 151 00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.470 huda: Yeah. 152 00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:30.329 Jenny Duan: Like every detail like you put so much time into it. And how do you feel now that it's over? 153 00:18:31.000 --> 00:19:00.840 huda: Honestly, I think it's I think it was really like validating like, just because I've put a lot of effort into like the different events like that, like the AI ethics Bootcamp thing that we did and like. Barely any one showed up. And then this time just ha",
    "ving like a hackathon, which, like almost like a hundred people like showed up to and like submitted projects to. And then we have, like sponsors and everything. I think that was like really seeing, like the actual like progress happening in 154 00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.390 huda: like 155 00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:11.900 huda: real time was really, really just like it was really validating kind of that like. Oh, so I actually, I can actually make kind of like a hackathon. I can host these things. And 156 00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:20.169 huda: you know, I think now that I have done it once, I could probably like post more hack phones in the future, which is kind of inspirational. But yeah. 157 00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.789 Jenny Duan: Especially because you did literally everything yourself. 158 00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:33.739 Jenny Duan: like it wasn't like, oh, you're like parents helped you or someone else helped you like. You did everything yourself, and that's in just incredible. 159 00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.773 huda: Thank you. 160 00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:40.290 Jenny Duan: So what's next for empowering AI like? What is your next step? What are you planning to do with it? 161 00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:53.010 huda: Okay. So that's we've been talking a little bit with my team. And then we noticed that this event did really well. And so now we have a kind of a discord with like 70 people. Maybe. 162 00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.919 Jenny Duan: Oh, my! Gosh! Incredible! 163 00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:01.569 huda: Yeah. And so we're trying to convert that into like, kind of just our main discord. And so 164 00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:18.206 huda: we wanna like, continue this momentum by having, like more, you know, seminars and workshops. But I've also noticed that maybe those might not do as well. So we might just host, like many, many competitions. See if we can get sponsors on those as well. 165 00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:31.265 huda: cause like, I feel like a lot of people just kind of ",
    "join for prizes and competition and like honors and stuff. So I think if we do a lot more competitions, I think that could be good from empowering AI and 166 00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:44.010 huda: we we also wanna like in our on our website, we wanna create kind of like a gallery with all the projects. And then also like a website kind of just part of our website will be like displaying information about power hacks. 167 00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.282 huda: But we obviously wanna do this again. So 168 00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.350 huda: I don't think we could do it anytime soon. 169 00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:51.470 huda: but 170 00:20:52.370 --> 00:21:11.366 huda: like organizing another hack found might be good for us. But in the meantime we're thinking of doing like a writing competition where someone can write about like AI ethics or like computer science. And then we can feature them on our website. But then, again, that's kind of like the same thing as our 171 00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.259 huda: AI image generation type thing that we did. And it didn't really do as well. 172 00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.110 Jenny Duan: Oh, how did how did people did people submit to that? 173 00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.859 huda: No, we have, like zeros submissions. 174 00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.470 Jenny Duan: No! Oh. 175 00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.740 huda: Yeah. 176 00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.009 Jenny Duan: What do you think made this Hackathon do so well 177 00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.339 Jenny Duan: because it like 178 00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.630 Jenny Duan: 10 x or 100 x, you know expectations. 179 00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:53.999 huda: I think like, for one like hackathons are a lot more accessible to people. I feel like it's like, like, I feel like if we just do our own separate competition. Which isn't featured online stuff, people can't find it. And then also, like the way we were able to like raise money and stuff I think that really like brought people in 180 00:21:54.040 --> 00:2",
    "2:11.626 huda: as well as like, I think, cause with what with what we're trying to do with like the AI generation thing is it was kind of based off like an honor thing. But I I don't think anyone really cares about that, especially if it's just like a high school nonprofit. Who's gonna be giving that recognition? So 181 00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:34.430 huda: like, I think, for one, prizes were like way better. Second of all, it was like a like an exclusive event like, oh, it's gonna happen in these 2 days. There's me workshops like it's it was like they're gonna get a lot of benefits. So that's why a lot of people were showing up. But like that, competition might have been more confusing, even like with the guide like people. I don't think people would take the time to do that. 182 00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.730 huda: So that's kind of like. 183 00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.589 huda: and people don't really get the point of it. So that's kind of like one thing as well. 184 00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.453 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. So 185 00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.009 Jenny Duan: also, like the 186 00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.840 Jenny Duan: the 187 00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:59.259 Jenny Duan: So the future of empowering AI. What are you thinking about? So more competitions? What does that look like. And I think that right now, like competition wise. 188 00:22:59.577 --> 00:23:25.279 Jenny Duan: I think now that you've had one successful event like this is something that is like, I think, takes a lot of the pressure off of like trying to get statistics for empowering AI, because now you have, like, you know, something to report back to, but like what's next in terms of competitions? Is there anything in Media that you're planning, or is it? I know you just had this event, and you've been traveling. So it's not like like there has to be something. But like, if you want to brainstorm, or if you have any ideas. We could talk through that. 189 00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.320 huda: Yeah. So 190",
    " 00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:35.079 huda: I think this one might. I don't know if it's a great idea. But we could possibly do like an empowering AI website challenge, because. 191 00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.420 Jenny Duan: Oh! What would that be like. 192 00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:46.660 huda: Like right now. So either. So 2 ways you could go about. This is for one we can have like, have like a conversation for someone to design our website, 193 00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:53.160 huda: and then cause just cause, I feel like our current website doesn't really like it doesn't really represent, like the 194 00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:58.609 huda: I guess, like the empowering girls kind of aspect. It's just kind of like a generic website. I feel. 195 00:23:59.018 --> 00:24:04.040 huda: And then another way we could go about. It is kind of have, like. 196 00:24:04.546 --> 00:24:09.929 huda: a theme, or like different themes. And then people to develop a website for it. But yeah. 197 00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:21.010 Jenny Duan: What would you? What do you think the competition would be in that case? Or how would you incentivize people to do that cause? I think, like the issue right now is for the issue in the past with incentives like you talked about right? No one wants this like 198 00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.749 Jenny Duan: recognition, but like people might want prizes from sponsors. 199 00:24:26.311 --> 00:24:31.369 huda: I think we could do similar like fundraising process. I mean, I think 200 00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:39.432 huda: I think like maybe people might not be as receptive as with the hackathon, because there's like the whole Hackathon website. And 201 00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.309 huda: there was like 202 00:24:41.700 --> 00:25:01.950 huda: kind of like, hackathons are a little bit different from different competitions. So maybe you could just like list it as a hackathon like on the Hackathon website and do similar like fundraising type thing to get more sponsors, and this time w",
    "e could get like different sponsors, like maybe larger brands like figma would be a great one. I know. I've seen like a couple of hackathons which have been sponsored by figma. So 203 00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.340 Jenny Duan: Amazing. 204 00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:09.289 huda: Yeah, if they could, if they could. Sponsor, that would be amazing. Especially since that's really related to web development. 205 00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.510 huda: And then. 206 00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:18.429 huda: yeah, like, just more like web development, specific prices. That would be that'd be really good. But 207 00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:26.809 huda: yeah, like, just thinking, like, so maybe like a mini hack on, you know, like or actually, I think I think like last time 208 00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.509 huda: this morning. 209 00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.250 Jenny Duan: Wars. 210 00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.860 Jenny Duan: Hello! 211 00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:39.845 huda: I? This might be my dad. I'm not sure. 212 00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.160 Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. Hi! How's it going? 213 00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.760 Jenny Duan: I don't know if you can hear me. Yeah, I don't. 214 00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:47.800 huda: Nice, he said. 215 00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.719 huda: I think it's really early in the morning for him. I'm not sure. 216 00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.429 huda: But okay. 217 00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.620 Ivylevel: I hope. 218 00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.520 Ivylevel: Fake. 219 00:26:00.241 --> 00:26:02.350 Jenny Duan: I don't. Maybe it's like a Miss 220 00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.359 Jenny Duan: click. I'm not sure 221 00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.559 Jenny Duan: I just wanna make sure he gets a chance to speak if he wants to speak. 222 00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.209 huda: Oh, yeah, I don't think that's my dad. I don't think that's my dad. 223 00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.720 Jenny Duan: Maybe. Mary, okay. 224 00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.800 Jenny Duan: Okay. 225 00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.8",
    "09 Ivylevel: I am so sorry I'm having issues with the audio, but it's me. It's Mary. 226 00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.346 Jenny Duan: Okay, no, no worries. 227 00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay. 228 00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.829 Jenny Duan: continue. Continue what you're saying. 229 00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:56.564 huda: Yeah. So actually, towards the end of like the closing ceremony, I was asking, like, our participants and stuff like, what type of a events. Would you be interested in participating in in the future from empowering AI. And a lot of them are saying like kind of long, longer form hackthones so like hackathons, which might like 2 to 3 days, and having like workshops like 2 workshops a day, maybe something like that. And I think that's a pretty good idea. 230 00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:05.380 huda: like, I think if we're able to organize like a smaller, like smaller, but like more widespread hackathon, I think that would be like 231 00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:25.175 huda: that could be our next goal. I think. Yeah, cause like, obviously, like, we don't have to try too hard about metrics. But I think, like these longer term hackathons are definitely like, really good. And also, if we do pay like a little bit of money, we can get featured on like the Dev post site, and then and also. 232 00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.370 Jenny Duan: Featured. 233 00:27:27.237 --> 00:27:32.410 huda: Let me. I think it's like a subscription. But like, I remember, I got an email about it. 234 00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:40.600 huda: and like the people that have been featured have gone like thousands of like participants. So 235 00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:51.618 huda: I think it's deleted actually 236 00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.380 huda: but like. 237 00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.180 huda: actually, I'm not sure but 238 00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.099 huda: yeah, there's, I think I think there's like 239 00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:32.809 huda: it might be a little expensive, but if it isn't, ",
    "then we'll probably be able to purchase that for our 240 00:28:33.597 --> 00:28:35.112 huda: next competition. 241 00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.950 huda: and then also, maybe, like. 242 00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:47.628 huda: maybe, like with judges, kind of having more official people like our sponsors. I mean, we did have people that like worked at Google and 243 00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.700 huda: like Nvidia. 244 00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.430 huda: But like people from our sponsors kind of talk about what they do would be great. But 245 00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:55.940 huda: anyway. 246 00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.029 huda: yeah, I think it would be a little more organized then. 247 00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.970 huda: But 248 00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.060 huda: yeah. 249 00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.112 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Well, congrats again. And like, that's such a cool opportunity. 250 00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.760 Jenny Duan: and like such cool progress that you've made 251 00:29:12.175 --> 00:29:14.920 Jenny Duan: and like opportunity to keep on growing even more. 252 00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:34.529 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, cool. So I think the next thing that we wanted to talk about. So I feel like empowering. AI is like it's covered like we have some good numbers. It's like covered. Let's talk about Santoria. How is that going? And like any progress on the gaming community publicization, anything that we've mentioned or talked about in the past. 253 00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:44.948 huda: Yeah. So I've been I've been posting something on like different, like indie game development servers. I'm not sure if they've done 2 effectively. 254 00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.420 huda: like, if I go to 255 00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.499 huda: with the analytics for centuria 256 00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.190 huda: I could possibly find out, like how many people played it. But 257 00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.515 huda: so there's only been like 410 plays so far. 258 00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10",

And then there was, like everyone complaining about 275 00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:30.514 huda: like why do you want something designed specifically for women like they're just like hating like, really hard. And then 276 00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:37.319 huda: like, I turn off the comments. But yeah, I just kinda kept making videos after that. 277 00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.269 Jenny Duan: Has your account gained more followers since then? 278 00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.329 huda: Yeah, it's it's only around at around like 60.

But then 281 00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.850 Jenny Duan: I think it's so like she talks such like a 282 00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.949 Jenny Duan: hard platform to crack. It's a really hard. 283 00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.740 huda: So, yeah. 284 00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:15.340 Jenny Duan: Like what? Okay? I've like made Tiktoks in like high school, and I made them every day, and I never got any followers. And then in college, like I randomly just started making tiktoks, and it like got me so many fo well, not so many, but like I just started gaining followers at a faster rate. So I just, I feel like Tiktok is just so. 285 00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.099 Jenny Duan: I don't know. It's like it's difficult to crack. 286 00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.280 huda: Yeah. 287 00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:31.940 Jenny Duan: But yeah, okay, I think the goal should still be to get more people playing synthoria. Are you still like publishing it? A lot on Linkedin, and things, too. I feel like your Linkedin's also been popping off. Can't lie. 288 00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.126 huda: I don't know. I I don't think I've put been posting on Linkedin too much. I wanna say 289 00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.649 huda: like I have been kind of like doing that. But then 290 00:32:44.027 --> 00:32:47.149 huda: I feel like I've been a bit inactive. But 291 00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.990 huda: anyway, I think I wanna I wanna do like a lot of new posts, for 292 00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.980 huda: in power hacks. 293 00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.719 Jenny Duan: Okay, and so what posts are you envisioning. 294 00:33:02.163 --> 00:33:05.319 huda: Let me put in the chat like what I wrote so far. 295 00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.500 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 296 00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:44.830 Jenny Duan: Okay. 297 00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.850 Jenny Duan: that looks good. 298 00:33:53.50",

I was like, I have to do like a lot of so I have like a lot of footage and stuff from like the hackathon. So I was planning on posting like a lot about it. So this is just the one for, like 1st place. And then we're gonna post one for second place and 3rd place, 300 00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:21.880 huda: And then I wanted to make like shorts or like Youtube shorts and like Instagram reels for like the judges panel. I think that would be like, I think that's like viral content. But 301 00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.590 huda: yeah, it might take me some time to edit. But yeah. 302 00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.026 Jenny Duan: Got it? 303 00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:30.889 Jenny Duan: And 304 00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:43.849 Jenny Duan: as to what you're like planning to do for centuria other than social media, how are you in Linkedin? How are you planning on like publicizing even more? Is there anything I can do to like support on that end? 305 00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.489 huda: So 306 00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.800 huda: I think 307 00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.100 huda: I think 308 00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.380 huda: if I if I'm able to like, reach out to more youtubers. That would be good. 309 00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:56.890 huda: I think 310 00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:00.995 huda: that's a good idea, but I've never like gotten response back. 311 00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.530 Jenny Duan: Can you hear? 312 00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.051 huda: But, like, I feel like that will be really effective. 313 00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:18.580 huda: I can try like like mailing, more cause. I don't think I've like mailed that many youtubers to get any responses back. But I think I that's worth the try. 314 00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:24.110 Jenny Duan: Okay. And then, are you publishing like, I feel like Satura would be good for, like 315 00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:30.080 Jenny Duan: ele",
    "mentary middle schoolers, low key, like young people. But how do you reach that audience? 316 00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.120 huda: I mean, I think I could post it and like 317 00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.594 huda: our community like Facebook group 318 00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.462 huda: like, I don't know how much, how good. That'll do, cause we don't have that big of a community. But 319 00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.789 huda: nonetheless, I think that could bring in a few people 320 00:35:49.516 --> 00:35:53.619 huda: cause there's like a lot of parents in there, and they could like maybe tell their kids to play 321 00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:56.830 huda: And then 322 00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:01.678 huda: I feel like any like Facebook group like I can join some like random ones. 323 00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.220 huda: maybe like about education. 324 00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:13.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And it it hasn't really taken. Have you started pitching it to those indie like game development newsletters that we talked about before. 325 00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:17.748 huda: I I don't think so. 326 00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.999 Jenny Duan: Do you want? Is that something that you feel like is feasible? Is that difficult? 327 00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.073 huda: Yeah, hold on. Let me check, cause I I don't really remember this. 328 00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:32.359 Jenny Duan: I don't think we've talked about specific newsletters. I think we've just like discussed it in passing. 329 00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.610 huda: Oh, okay, yeah. If we could like, find some that might be. 330 00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.923 Jenny Duan: Okay, why don't we look at that right now? 331 00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.410 Jenny Duan: video game, do you go? 332 00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.499 Jenny Duan: okay, I'm gonna start linking some newsletters. 333 00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:56.690 Jenny Duan: Oh. 334 00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.596 huda: Sorry.

    ".790 --> 00:38:00.920 Jenny Duan: Sorry I didn't. Didn't. 336 00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.525 huda: No 337 00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:11.256 huda: So for folklift there's like 2 founders and they reached out to me, asking if I was able to like, read an article about them. So right now. 338 00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.070 Jenny Duan: Eric. 339 00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.608 huda: Yeah, I've they reached out to me on Linkedin. So 340 00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:22.439 huda: I think they found me through that. And then I'm just like working on the interview right now. But 341 00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:27.310 huda: yeah, like, I'm hoping to add them to like our businesses. Kind of side. 342 00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.640 Jenny Duan: What type of 343 00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.969 Jenny Duan: game or sorry I'm confused. What type of business are they. 344 00:38:34.135 --> 00:38:58.919 huda: So one of them is like they fund like nonprofits and stuff. And then, before they had, like a all female forming like a board, and then she just updated me that it's no longer all female. So then, instead, we're kind of refocusing it on like her journey as like a female founder, and like how she's been able to avoid Ops from the stuff. That's the kind of like questions I've been asking the interview. 345 00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:06.430 huda: but like, yeah, like, once she's done, I'm gonna be able to add her into like the social impact. 346 00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.860 huda: small businesses. 347 00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:15.240 Jenny Duan: How is full hook going other than that? Also, I'm like, I added, a couple of Indie game newsletters. 348 00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.059 Jenny Duan: I feel like you can take a look at. 349 00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:21.662 huda: Oh, those look good 350 00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.210 huda: In terms of folklift. 351 00:39:24.526 --> 00:39:30.413 huda: I don't think it's I feel like that's like, kind of all the updates I have. I feel like it's not going as 352 00:39:31.050 --> 00:",
    "39:33.009 huda: well as the other sharks. 353 00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:41.070 Jenny Duan: Okay, so let's think about how we can make it go better. So I mean, I've been seeing your social media posts, too. Like, where are you sourcing those articles from? 354 00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.790 huda: Yeah. Oh, I'm running a couple of articles like I wrote the one about Nikki Haley, 355 00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.549 huda: and I'm trying to be a little more active on our sub stack 356 00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.470 huda: and then also our medium. So like 357 00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:01.350 huda: I don't that I don't know if we have a significant enough like analytics for that. But 358 00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:06.540 huda: it has been. I've been creating like a little bit more content for folklift in that way. 359 00:40:07.457 --> 00:40:09.280 huda: And then, like 360 00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:17.322 huda: the vice president that I got from like India. She's working on a couple of like small business interviews right now. 361 00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.260 huda: So there's like, gonna be like 3 to 4 more 362 00:40:21.607 --> 00:40:34.379 huda: Indian small businesses, but like I think, my outreach for this one isn't as good and but actually like. Now that I think about it. There's like a couple of like nonprofits that have been like liking or empowering AI 363 00:40:34.783 --> 00:40:38.330 huda: like posts which are kind of similar to folklift. 364 00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:44.750 huda: And then I think I I could like possibly like, reach out to them and see if they want to do a collaboration or something like that. 365 00:40:45.265 --> 00:40:45.770 huda: Okay. 366 00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:49.960 Jenny Duan: When is, did you reach out to the J camp alumni? This is like, kind of a 367 00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.090 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 368 00:40:51.851 --> 00:40:58.138 huda: I actually got on a call with one of them, and they said they weren't like allowed to like, give too much information. But ",
    "369 00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:03.069 huda: yeah, cause they're like, right now, they're like a rising freshman college. So they don't have like 370 00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.400 huda: any advice like solid advice. But 371 00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.659 huda: yeah, like, you're still like, really insightful like. 372 00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:14.344 huda: they said, to do like a lot of research before J. Camp. 373 00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.200 huda: yeah. 374 00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:19.950 Jenny Duan: Wow! 375 00:41:20.515 --> 00:41:23.570 Jenny Duan: And so like, what does that mean for you like 376 00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.600 Jenny Duan: in terms of in terms of like 377 00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:36.749 Jenny Duan: maximizing your impact in full flood, and being a self publicist, did you ask them about that? For, like starting your own journalism, or being a more involved journalism in your personal life. 378 00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:47.699 huda: Yeah. I asked them a little bit of tips of like a few tips on like journalism in general.

So I don't think I was like really specific about like what to do. 382 00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.610 huda: She's gonna be attending Csu. Fullerton. 383 00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:10.040 huda: And she said, she's not really like pursuing journalism in general. Like she's doing communications. So 384 00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.619 huda: it's like kinda similar. 385 00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:17.249 huda: Well, like, yeah, she doesn't like the one person that I met with was like. 386 00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:23.669 huda: I'm like the other people.

And then. 394 00:42:55.190 --> 00:43:08.053 huda: 1st of all, like, they're like dressing like, it's like, really strict, like it has to be like not too baggy, not too tight like they have, like a whole checklist. About like what we can bring and then. 395 00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.959 Jenny Duan: Otherwise, why do you need to be dressed in certain way? I don't understand. 396 00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.530 huda: We have to be business casual and then like. 397 00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.424 huda: And then it's kind of like specific, like 398 00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.780 huda: like, for example. 399 00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:29.059 huda: It can't like. If you wear like skirts, they can be like too short or too long, or like I don't know. It's just like a whole. 400 00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:34.020 Jenny Duan: Why? Why cause you're meeting important people or just cause they're picky for no reason. 401 00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:43.455 huda: Yeah, I think it's cause we're gonna be like meeting important people. And then like, we're also gonna like they're gonna have like videos and stuff. And they wanna maybe make it look more professional. Maybe. 402 00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.250 Jenny Duan: That makes sense, I guess. 403 00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:53.599 huda: Yeah, but but yeah, they did tell us, like, 2 locations we're gonna be going to and like, possibly reporting at",
    " 404 00:43:54.170 --> 00:44:01.689 huda: And so they told us to kind of do like a little bit of research, and come up with like 2 headlines or like article pitches 405 00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:04.090 huda: and like, send it beforehand. 406 00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:06.530 huda: And so that's kinda like, that's kinda scary. 407 00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.630 huda: But yeah. 408 00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:26.320 Jenny Duan: I'm so happy for you. It's going to be such a good experience, I think, and if anything, hopefully, the travel and the hackathon has taught you that you're so you're capable of so much, and you're going to meet even cooler people who can push you to grow even more. So that's going to be so exciting. And hopefully, there, you can get some insight onto, like 409 00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.910 Jenny Duan: how to 410 00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:30.370 Jenny Duan: get more people to read your journalism. 411 00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.120 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 412 00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.400 huda: For me, and. 413 00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.104 Jenny Duan: In and of itself. 414 00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.360 Jenny Duan: I think, for folklift. 415 00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:38.960 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 416 00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.909 Jenny Duan: how else can you publicize folklift? 417 00:44:42.486 --> 00:44:43.580 Jenny Duan: Does your 418 00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.589 Jenny Duan: journalism, teacher?

Do you know, or do you think. 420 00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.868 huda: I mean, they have like a school newspaper. 421 00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.870 huda: So maybe like 422 00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:07.072 huda: I don't know if we'd be able to get featured on that. But that could possibly won't be one way. 423 00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.350 Jenny Duan: Try. 424 00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.519 huda: Yeah, I think I'll I'll I think I'll ask. When scho",

I think 433 00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.016 huda: I think I could pitch the idea to them, and I think 434 00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:47.460 huda: like my friend, has like a contact to one of the head journalists. So 435 00:45:47.794 --> 00:45:51.779 huda: I can ask if they'd be able to give that to me, but. 436 00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:57.529 Jenny Duan: You can even ask the byline, or like a guest newspap like a guest feature, or something like that. 437 00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:00.175 huda: Yeah, that would be interesting. 438 00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:06.819 huda: and maybe like I could write like an OP. Ed about like Mount House. Maybe that would be cool. 439 00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.269 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Why not? 440 00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.989 Jenny Duan: That seems really cool. 441 00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:19.410 huda: Yeah, I think I could. That was pretty interesting. I think I'll I'll reach out to Manhattan for that. 442 00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:30.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because when you elevate your own journalism, I feel like that also adds credibility to like Full cliff, because you can tie those things in together like your independent journalism. And you're like work with Full cliff, too. 443 00:46:32.814 --> 00:46:34.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds great. 444 00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.699 Jenny Duan: And then finally. 445 00:46:37.960 --> 00:46",
    ":44.889 Jenny Duan: I think those are like all the main extracurricular items I wanted to like, talk about if you like. 446 00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:55.979 Jenny Duan: have started something new cause.

It was like too late. 452 00:47:17.685 --> 00:47:21.949 huda: I might like contact them again if they still have like time. 453 00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:28.739 huda: But yeah, like, I'll try that.
