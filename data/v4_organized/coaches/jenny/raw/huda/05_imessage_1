Aug 1, 2023 at 7:26AM Hi Huda!! So excited to work together! i saw the “girls for algorithmic justice” initiative and really liked it! i think it’s really cool how they are spreading information about this less known topic and also taking action against it. i really want to do something similar… Yes, I sent you this account for inspiration and an idea of what you can create! We’ll chat more tomorrow ! Aug 2, 2023 at 7:08PM Great meeting with you today! As discussed, here are some First Day of School Strategies– 1. Raise your hand and speak once in every single class 2. Talk to your teacher and introduce yourself after class 3. Make new friends! Talk to the people around you in each class 4. Set up a meeting with your counselor within the first week of school . first week of school One thing I remember we talked about is how you feel like your friend group at school is slightly toxic is this the case or did I remember incorrectly? hi Jenny! thank you so much! it was an honor getting to spend time with you to plan my schedule! i’ll definitely try being more outgoing and stand out more in class regarding the friend group- kind of? the majority of my friend group isn’t exactly too focused on extracurriculars . the ones that are preparing for a t20 college are a bit more inclusive and join me/ help me create initiatives or help me with school. the toxic culture at school stems from the major clubs— hackathon club, muslim student association, and robotics club are just some of the major clubs that i’m interested in that have the same friend group as their officers. they rig every election and make it hard to have a shot at these major clubs. by “rigging” i mean non-muslim friends joining msa, voting their muslim friends, and LEAVING right after the election is over.. these new officers also have never made a contribution and the few events we had were freshman year! sorry for the long paragraph of just me complaining about rigged clubs \" No need to apologize at all! I see completely I would say that the people you surround yourself with are really important and cannot be understated. Because you grow to become like the people around you, so it’s important to avoid fixed mindset people and people mportant to avod xed mndset people and people who bring you down :) And to surround yourself with students who inspire you and motivate you to achieve your goals together Aug 5, 2023 at 5:39PM hi jenny!! for some reason the internet isn’t working and i’m trying to get it up right now No problem- see you soon Aug 8, 2023 at 9:23AM Hey Huda! Would you be able to send me your course schedule this year? Like a PDF of the classes you’re taking :) yes! i’m so sorry i took a screenshot and just forgot to send you… Aug 10, 2023 at 7:33PM here are some activities i participate in: - speech and debate - hackathon club - new ai ethic club - part of both computer science and media arts pathway at school - joining usaco club this year honestly can’t think of anything else at the moment, but this is sort of it! Aug 12, 2023 at 5:31PM hi jenny! do you know what the meeting passcode is Yes! Sorry give me one second Join our Cloud HD Video Meeting us06web.zoom.us Aug 15, 2023 at 5:35PM Hey Huda! Will you be joining soon? Join our Cloud HD Video Meeting us06web.zoom.us hi! sorry- i’ll join shortly! Amazing see you soon :) hey! i’m in the call, can you see me? ey m n e ca, can you see me Can you hear me? Aug 15, 2023 at 8:40PM hey jenny, i was trying to research some more companies to ask but i realized there aren’t many muslim-owned businesses. do you think i should reach out to other small businesses ? Hmmm, how many were you able to find? Can you identify 5? I think that’s enough to start :) Aug 16, 2023 at 11:29AM i’m stuck at 4 :( i also don’t think the family friend would be able to participate since he closed his business my counselor isn’t responding \" i think i’m going to ask the community college support to see if they can help me instead Aug 17, 2023 at 12:37AM i’m stuck at 4 :( i also don’t think the family friend would be able to participate since he closed his business Oh hmmm:( okay! Are there any other Facebook groups you can find? my counselor isn’t responding \" i think i’m going to ask the community college support to see if they can help me instead Okay no worries! You don’t need to ask the community college support- the point of getting to know your counselor is so they can direct you to school/district specific respurces Resources No need to ask the cc person- we can wait it our Out Aug 17, 2023 at 2:24PM sure! i needed to organize signing up for cc courses with her because she has to sign a form for me to with her because she has to sign a form for me to be able to take it and i think courses may be starting really soon… it’s frustrating because i wouldn’t be able to take the film college course if she isn’t available and she isn’t interactive or interested at all i can try doing more research on facebook, i’ll try reaching out to the 4 first Aug 17, 2023 at 6:54PM Ohhh got it! Oh no! I’m so sorry Yes it would be good to try to push. Is there anyone else you can talk to? Aug 21, 2023 at 11:53AM i might not be able to enroll for cc this semester - also, i now have to decide which club to continue since we don’t have enough advisors to do both. i really want to continue both \" Aug 22, 2023 at 12:58AM Ooh oh no!! are there any other teachers you can talk to? Continue the original club, we can make the AI ethics one as a nonprofit organization or something different. Let’s brainstorm What’s up with the cc class? Aug 30, 2023 at 6:40PM Do you take a foreign language class? Yes I finished my Spanish classes last school year Okay great are you taking one this year? Okay great are you taking one this year? What level of Spanish did you finish up to? I’m not taking any this year, but I’m going to self study AP Spanish culture - I took it until level 3 or the last one before the APs Ok ok:) Is it possible to sign up for the AP Spanish class now? Or is it too late It’s too late unfortunately : Reason being stanford and other top schools specifically look for 3+ years foreign language :) Ohh I didn’t know that!! Hi! I drafted a caption for my first post, is it possible for you to check to see if it looks okay? Hello everyone! My name is Huda Siraj! ✨ I am a 16 year old indie game developer and filmmaker $ % ☁ Currently, I'm making my game \"Synthoria,\" which is story-based adventure to teach a complex subject, machine learning and AI, in a way that younger audiences are able to understand! ' ( $ Looking forward to sharing my journey with this game on here! Oooh I love it!!! I have some suggestions: is there a name change we can do to align it more with ai ethics or equity or DEI? DEI? Can you include something about women in stem or ai ethics or diversity? Aug 31, 2023 at 7:37PM hm, yes i agree the game needs a more ai ethics related name but i’m not sure what to name it still i think i’ll add that the game introduces topics like ai ethics and famous women in computer science like ada lovelace or carol shaw! That makes sense! I think synthoria is a pretty catchy name, how did you come up with it? i tried naming the place they’re in, and since the AI basically creates everything i added the “synth” and “oria” is just a suffix for a place \" so i’m trying to think of different ideas. how does “ai arcana” or “rogue: an ethical enigma” sound? Tbh I think Synthoria is good for now! Can always rebrand later ! I like the idea of having a 1 word name sorry to bother you, but does this look better? Hello everyone!

I recently heard that there were digital PSAT practice tests- do you know if your school has this portal set up? Sep 26, 2023 at 11:11AM i’ll ask my counselor today! Sep 26, 2023 at 3:10PM Awesome!

Oct 24, 2023 at 9:30PM hey jenny! i have tried submitting my application, but am receiving some issues and it isn’t resolving even after i’ve tried retyping it, reloading, restarting, etc. i’ve sent an email to the customer service so i’m hoping they’d help me out with this! Oh no! Weird! 4/2? That’s more than 2 I think that’ll be an issue on their end, don’t worry! they also required me to upload a profile picture and biography in 3rd person discussing my future plans and biggest accomplishment- let me send what i and biggest accomplishment- let me send what i put :) Yayyyy Maybe instead of “avoid issues” you should write “prioritize ethics” ! Looks so great! You’re so accomplished! thank you so much :) yes i think that sounds better as well Oct 27, 2023 at 1:11PM hey! update on the ncwit application- tech support was able to submit it for me on their end! :) it also required a teacher endorsement so i have sent it to my cs teacher who confirmed she would love to. Yay! So exciting! Oct 30, 2023 at 11:35PM hey jenny!! i was wondering if we can start any applications for awards soon. my dad is getting a bit worried, especially after viewing other students’ portfolio so he wanted me to build it sooner. Yes ofc! And when are you available for our next session? i told my dad tomorrow or wednesday i’m not sure if he has asked you yet sorry for messaging so late btw - I don’t think he’s reached out yet! But both should be ok :) No worries hahaha Nov 4, 2023 at 6:47PM Heyy, I was wondering if we could call tomorrow at 1 pm! Or actually any time after that should be fine with me :) Hi!! Would tomorrow evening work? Maybe around 8pm? That sounds good! Wonderful! Nov 6, 2023 at 4:53PM Hey jenny! So sorry for canceling yesterday :( since we’re having a meeting today, I was trying to send ’ , over my QAS for the October sat but wasn’t sure how to send it to you since it’s only available on my account No worries! Can you download a PDF? SATStudentScoreReport_1699318777683 PDF Document · 1.5 MB prd-srd-pdf-download.s3.amazonaws.com I can send this page but not the QAS Is it not downloadable? Nov 6, 2023 at 6:45PM Yea it’s just a page on their website Ah I see! Let’s go over it in the meeting! Nov 10, 2023 at 2:45PM I haven’t heard an update about scheduling for I haven’t heard an update about scheduling for tonight— do you want to do tomorrow or Sunday instead? Nov 10, 2023 at 3:56PM My dad was wondering if you’d be able to schedule it on calendly on your end,, If tonight isn’t good for you, tomorrow works for me as well! Nov 10, 2023 at 6:43PM Oh okay no worries! Let’s stick with tonight. I’m on the call! Nov 13, 2023 at 6:41PM Hey jenny!! Sorry for not getting back sooner. My practice SAT scored 1480- my dad was able to grade the sections for me! It was actually an even split, so 740-740. Reading felt a bit tough, and some math questions I may need to review with you in our next meeting Nov 13, 2023 at 8:24PM Ooh congrats! Huge jump again! How are you feeling? Sounds good! Nov 14, 2023 at 8:33AM I’m a bit skeptical because I’m unsure why my practice score is so different from the actual score,, especially since I practiced regular testing conditions this practice test But overall the math section had extremely simple questions in comparison Nov 15, 2023 at 6:59AM Hmmm no worries! We can definitely discuss. How’s your schedule tomorrow night? Nov 15, 2023 at 11:53AM Any time after 4pm should work for me except for 6-7pm! Nov 15, 2023 at 11:40PM Great!let’s do 8? Nov 16, 2023 at 8:27AM Sounds good!! Nov 29, 2023 at 5:18PM hey!! i was wondering when you would be available for a call Nov 29, 2023 at 9:53PM How’s 6:30-7:30 pm tmrw? ! Nov 30, 2023 at 11:47AM sounds good! Nov 30, 2023 at 3:46PM Just sent an invite! Nov 30, 2023 at 6:31PM Be there in a minute! Sorry running a bit late. hey, no worries! Ready when u are:) sorry i joined the google meeting \" All good! i’m in the call but it says waiting for the host Oh wait let me make sure I’m on the correct link Wow it says that for me too One second Ok should be good now it’s the personal meeting room right? Dec 1, 2023 at 9:18PM Good luck tmrw! You’ve got this thanks! was wondering if you had any last minute tips i’ve taken a couple math practice tests and they’re going pretty well :) i’ve also been trying to shift focus to reading as i know i’ve spent lots of time on math and don’t want my score to flip again Dec 1, 2023 at 11:10PM I think the most important thing you can do at this point is probably ensure that you get a good night’s rest, a good breakfast in the morning, and that you feel mentally ready. There’s not that much cramming you can do at this point! So just ensure that you are calm and know that you have prepared the best you can :) thank you so much jenny! i will let you know how it goes after! Dec 2, 2023 at 7:52AM Good luck!!

Which essay specifically? it was the “why do you want to be a bank of america leader/why should we pick you” one! Dec 12, 2023 at 5:49PM Thanks! Sorry for the delayed response— let me take a look I really like your current start to the essay! I really like your current start to the essay! I think you can continue with the prayer analogy to the news, issues going on in the world, and other factors you see Maybe you can continue it by saying “instead of these conversations… etc” and connect it to the theme of disconnect Dec 21, 2023 at 8:01PM hey jenny! will we be meeting in the stanford zoom from the doc? That works! I don’t think an invite was sent out so that’s perfect It’s doing that weird zoom thing again Where I got the email saying you’re in the waiting room but you don’t show up Join our Cloud HD Video Meeting stanford.zoom.us Can you try this link hmm ok!

She was President Barbie. Naturally loud, outspoken, and bubbly. I brought my dolls to school, in hopes of sharing it with everyone. To my distress, everyone grabbed one and ran off as chaos entailed in the room. I tried to organize my classmates the same way President Barbie did with her amplified sound box, but all I managed was a squeak. Naturally quiet, shy, and reserved. I’ve always wanted to be President Barbie, but no matter the initiative, passion, or drive I had for a cause, my own vocal chords held me back. However, I recently began working on this issue through my Empowering AI initiative, an AI ethics educational nonprofit, where collaboration with students across the nation has made me outspoken. I want to grow my platform to speak to more people louder and more assertive of my ideas. I want to continue evolving that squeak into a roar. I want to continue my transformation into President Barbie. Jan 2, 2024 at 10:15PM Yes of course! You too! This is a great essay topic!! I love it. I think we can make some small changes to highlight your growth more— it’s a great start! I’ll connect with Siraj to schedule your next meeting shortly!

This is an example of a student at Stanford: wow this is so impressive! i know this is kind of grand, but i was starting to make a discord server for game developers called “the game dev collective” and i’ve gotten a couple people interested already,, it initially started off as just a way to get more people interested in my game but i honestly feel like it would be great having a place for game devs to connect, share feedback, etc. Jan 8, 2024 at 10:24PM I love that!!!! That’s a great idea! There isn’t anything like that, so it seems perfect Jan 12, 2024 at 6:23PM I got the NCWIT Award!!!! HUDA YAY CONGRATULATIONS!!!! Can you send me a ss? Which one?

It’s okay I sleep late also, don’t worry about times haha The last sentence — seems like ur already speaking up, so maybe “hope” is the wrong word here? hmm i want to emphasize how i want to grow here,, so maybe i can say i hope to speak up louder? also had a quick question- did u advise me to add the bit about how cam is free in the section on the bit about how jcamp is free in the section on additional information or why jcamp essay? Actually i hope to speak up is good! I like how it is yes! If you can/if you haven’t mentioned it elsewhere Like notre dame just use the additional info to sell ur self a bit more Fri, Mar 1 at 12:56PM hello! is there anything i can change about this essay? i need to cut it down a bit bc it’s 160 words and needs to be 150 Take out the “with” in the first sentence “He stood outside the Big Ben” He exclaimed excitedly in his Is that enough? oh actually i need to cut 15 more words! i can try cutting some wording from the 3rd paragraph",

    "iMessage Jul 31, 2023 at 9:10AM hi jenny! this is huda. my dad gave me your number. i saw the “girls for algorithmic justice” initiative and really liked it! i think it’s really cool how they are spreading information about this less known topic and also taking action against it. i really want to do something similar to this! Aug 1, 2023 at 7:26AM Hi Huda!! So excited to work together! i saw the “girls for algorithmic justice” initiative and really liked it! i think it’s really cool how they are spreading information about this less known topic and also taking action against it. i really want to do something similar… Yes, I sent you this account for inspiration and an idea of what you can create! We’ll chat more tomorrow ! Aug 2, 2023 at 7:08PM Great meeting with you today! As discussed, here are some First Day of School Strategies– 1. Raise your hand and speak once in every single class 2. Talk to your teacher and introduce yourself after class 3. Make new friends! Talk to the people around you in each class 4. Set up a meeting with your counselor within the first week of school . first week of school One thing I remember we talked about is how you feel like your friend group at school is slightly toxic is this the case or did I remember incorrectly? hi Jenny! thank you so much! it was an honor getting to spend time with you to plan my schedule! i’ll definitely try being more outgoing and stand out more in class regarding the friend group- kind of? the majority of my friend group isn’t exactly too focused on extracurriculars . the ones that are preparing for a t20 college are a bit more inclusive and join me/ help me create initiatives or help me with school. the toxic culture at school stems from the major clubs— hackathon club, muslim student association, and robotics club are just some of the major clubs that i’m interested in that have the same friend group as their officers. they rig every election and make it hard to have a shot at these major clubs. by “rigg",
    "ing” i mean non-muslim friends joining msa, voting their muslim friends, and LEAVING right after the election is over.. these new officers also have never made a contribution and the few events we had were freshman year! sorry for the long paragraph of just me complaining about rigged clubs \" No need to apologize at all! I see completely I would say that the people you surround yourself with are really important and cannot be understated. Because you grow to become like the people around you, so it’s important to avoid fixed mindset people and people mportant to avod xed mndset people and people who bring you down :) And to surround yourself with students who inspire you and motivate you to achieve your goals together Aug 5, 2023 at 5:39PM hi jenny!! for some reason the internet isn’t working and i’m trying to get it up right now No problem- see you soon Aug 8, 2023 at 9:23AM Hey Huda! Would you be able to send me your course schedule this year? Like a PDF of the classes you’re taking :) yes! i’m so sorry i took a screenshot and just forgot to send you… Aug 10, 2023 at 7:33PM here are some activities i participate in: - speech and debate - hackathon club - new ai ethic club - part of both computer science and media arts pathway at school - joining usaco club this year honestly can’t think of anything else at the moment, but this is sort of it! Aug 12, 2023 at 5:31PM hi jenny! do you know what the meeting passcode is Yes! Sorry give me one second Join our Cloud HD Video Meeting us06web.zoom.us Aug 15, 2023 at 5:35PM Hey Huda! Will you be joining soon? Join our Cloud HD Video Meeting us06web.zoom.us hi! sorry- i’ll join shortly! Amazing see you soon :) hey! i’m in the call, can you see me? ey m n e ca, can you see me Can you hear me? Aug 15, 2023 at 8:40PM hey jenny, i was trying to research some more companies to ask but i realized there aren’t many muslim-owned businesses. do you think i should reach out to other small businesses ? Hmmm, how many were you able to fi",
    "nd? Can you identify 5? I think that’s enough to start :) Aug 16, 2023 at 11:29AM i’m stuck at 4 :( i also don’t think the family friend would be able to participate since he closed his business my counselor isn’t responding \" i think i’m going to ask the community college support to see if they can help me instead Aug 17, 2023 at 12:37AM i’m stuck at 4 :( i also don’t think the family friend would be able to participate since he closed his business Oh hmmm:( okay! Are there any other Facebook groups you can find? my counselor isn’t responding \" i think i’m going to ask the community college support to see if they can help me instead Okay no worries! You don’t need to ask the community college support- the point of getting to know your counselor is so they can direct you to school/district specific respurces Resources No need to ask the cc person- we can wait it our Out Aug 17, 2023 at 2:24PM sure! i needed to organize signing up for cc courses with her because she has to sign a form for me to with her because she has to sign a form for me to be able to take it and i think courses may be starting really soon… it’s frustrating because i wouldn’t be able to take the film college course if she isn’t available and she isn’t interactive or interested at all i can try doing more research on facebook, i’ll try reaching out to the 4 first Aug 17, 2023 at 6:54PM Ohhh got it! Oh no! I’m so sorry Yes it would be good to try to push. Is there anyone else you can talk to? Aug 21, 2023 at 11:53AM i might not be able to enroll for cc this semester - also, i now have to decide which club to continue since we don’t have enough advisors to do both. i really want to continue both \" Aug 22, 2023 at 12:58AM Ooh oh no!! are there any other teachers you can talk to? Continue the original club, we can make the AI ethics one as a nonprofit organization or something different. Let’s brainstorm What’s up with the cc class? Aug 30, 2023 at 6:40PM Do you take a foreign language class? Yes I fin",
    "ished my Spanish classes last school year Okay great are you taking one this year? Okay great are you taking one this year? What level of Spanish did you finish up to? I’m not taking any this year, but I’m going to self study AP Spanish culture - I took it until level 3 or the last one before the APs Ok ok:) Is it possible to sign up for the AP Spanish class now? Or is it too late It’s too late unfortunately : Reason being stanford and other top schools specifically look for 3+ years foreign language :) Ohh I didn’t know that!! Hi! I drafted a caption for my first post, is it possible for you to check to see if it looks okay? Hello everyone!

Can you include something about women in stem or ai ethics or diversity? Aug 31, 2023 at 7:37PM hm, yes i agree the game needs a more ai ethics related name but i’m not sure what to name it still i think i’ll add that the game introduces topics like ai ethics and famous women in computer science like ada lovelace or carol shaw! That makes sense! I think synthoria is a pretty catchy name, how did you come up with it? i tried naming the place they’re in, and since the AI basically creates everything i added the “synth” and “oria” is just a suffix for a place \" so i’m trying to think of different ideas. how does “ai arcana” or “rogue: an ethical enigma” sound?

Oh no! Weird! 4/2? That’s more than 2 I think that’ll be an issue on their end, don’t worry! they also required me to upload a profile picture and biography in 3rd person discussing my future plans and biggest accomplishment- let me send what i and biggest accomplishment- let me send what i put :) Yayyyy Maybe instead of “avoid issues” you should write “prioritize ethics” !

    "getting back sooner. My practice SAT scored 1480- my dad was able to grade the sections for me! It was actually an even split, so 740-740.

Nov 14, 2023 at 8:33AM I’m a bit skeptical because I’m unsure why my practice score is so different from the actual score,, especially since I practiced regular testing conditions this practice test But overall the math section had extremely simple questions in comparison Nov 15, 2023 at 6:59AM Hmmm no worries!

Which essay specifically? it was the “why do you want to be a bank of america leader/why should we pick you” one! Dec 12, 2023 at 5:49PM Thanks! Sorry for the delayed response— let me take a look I really like your current start to the essay! I really like your current start to the essay! I think you can continue with the prayer analogy to the news, issues going on in the world, and other factors you see Maybe you can continue it by saying “instead of these conversations… etc” and connect it to the theme of disconnect Dec 21, 2023 at 8:01PM hey j",

She was President Barbie. Naturally loud, outspoken, and bubbly. I brought my dolls to school, in hopes of sharing it with everyone.

I want to continue my transformation into President Barbie. Jan 2, 2024 at 10:15PM Yes of course! You too! This is a great essay topic!! I love it. I think we can make some small ch",

It’s okay I sleep late also, don’t worry about times haha The last sentence — seems like ur already speaking up, so maybe “hope” is the wrong word here? hmm i want to emphasize how i want to grow here,, so maybe i can say i hope to speak up louder? also had a quick question- did u advise me to add the bit about how cam is free in the section on the bit about how jcamp is free in the section on additional information or why jcamp essay? Actually i hope to speak up is good! I like how it is yes! If you can/if you haven’t mentioned it elsewhere Like notre dame just use the additional info to sell ur self a bit more Fri, Mar 1 at 12:56PM hello! is there anything i can change about this essay? i need to cut it down a bit bc it’s 160 words and needs to be 150 Take out the “with” in the first sentence “He stood outside the Big Ben” He exclaimed excitedly in his Is that enough? oh actually i need to cut 15 more words! i can try cutting some wording from the 3rd paragraph"

That makes sense! I think synthoria is a pretty catchy name, how did you come up with it? i tried naming the place they’re in, and since the AI basically creates everything i added the “synth” and “oria” is just a suffix for a place \" so i’m trying to think of different ideas. how does “ai arcana” or “rogue: an ethical enigma” sound?

Oh no! Weird! 4/2? That’s more than 2 I think that’ll be an issue on their end, don’t worry! they also required me to upload a profile picture and biography in 3rd person discussing my future plans and biggest accomplishment- let me send what i and biggest accomplishment- let me send what i put :) Yayyyy Maybe instead of “avoid issues” you should write “prioritize ethics” ! Looks so great! You’re so accomplished! thank you so much :) yes i think that sounds better as well Oct 27, 2023 at 1:11PM hey! update on the ncwit application- tech support was able to submit it for me on their end! :) it also required a teacher endorsement so i have sent it to my cs teacher who confirmed she would love to.",

Hmmm is it an email or upload directl Directly Let me check Are you at school right now Do you know if you can ask in person? Yes I’m at school right now I can try asking after school Okay great!

Feb 29, 2024 at 10:26PM Beautiful sorry it’s late— what do you think of this essay? i don’t know if it’s the best but i kind of just placed what i was thinking \" Instead of “turn” maybe “channel”? It’s okay I sleep late also, don’t worry about times haha The last sentence — seems like ur already speaking up, so maybe “hope” is the wrong word here? hmm i want to emphasize how i want to grow here,, so maybe i can say i hope to speak up louder? also had a quick question- did u advise me to add the bit about how cam is free in the section on the bit about how jcamp is free in the section on additional information or why jcamp essay? Actually i hope to speak up is good! I like how it is yes! If you can/if you haven’t mentioned it elsewhere Like notre dame just use the additional info to sell ur self a bit more",
