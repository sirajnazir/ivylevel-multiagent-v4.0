I'm so happy for you. I think that's like great progress, especially since my practice has been in difficult class in the past. 3 00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.630 Jenny Duan: That's going. Well, how did your event yesterday? Going? Go? The event, the letter writing. 4 00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.680 huda: Yeah. So 5 00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:33.289 huda: like, I won't say a lot of people came. But since there's like a big timeframe like eventually, like towards the end, like a lot of people came within. And we're able to write like a lot of letters. So there's like a really fixed stack 6 00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:52.420 huda: But we're also like, so today, we also Sunday school. And then, we're gonna be like, have it. We're gonna have letters there, too. So in case that the parents wanna just like quickly, while they're dropping off the kids, you can just like sign their name. We're gonna try to do that. So that we will get more letters. 7 00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.979 Jenny Duan: Can you count? Or do you count them. 8 00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:08.089 huda: Yeah, actually, it's not at my house right now. It's like my other friend who's helping you on it is I'm taking charge 9 00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:37.229 huda: cool. I think there's been a lot of exciting stuff this week. So like also II saw that your game was featured on the interchange forecast. Did you get a lot of attention through that like, how did that go? Yeah, I think especially since I like we posted and like wrote under founders posts, a lot of like other Ceos, and everything were like commenting and connecting with me. 10 00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:46.049 huda: And I think that's really cool. And I got to like chat with like a few other founders. And we do a podcast as well. 11 00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.729 huda: and yeah. So I think it was really nice. I think I'm gonna continue posting about a little bit more. But 12 00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.060 huda: yeah, it was. It was like, make a lot of connections from that. 13 00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.930 Jenny Duan: And how is your linkedin like connections been going? 14 00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:28.879 huda: Yeah, I've been so I reached out to the well, I connected to like a bunch of people in the game development industry to reach out. Then a message like 3 women in game development. And so like, I kinda asked about like their journey and everything. They haven't responded. But I think I think I can 15 00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:39.989 huda: try to reach out to like kind of more local people. And yeah. So I think I've been, I've been connecting with a lot of people. But 16 00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.970 huda: yeah, like, I haven't got to call with it. 17 00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.269 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Have you been able to call with anyone? 18 00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.200 huda: Oh, no. 19 00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.689 Jenny Duan: okay. Have people not been responding? Or have they just like not been able to schedule? 20 00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.510 huda: I've I've like message 3 people and they haven't responded. But 21 00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.449 huda: yeah, I could probably message more people. I think that'd be better 22 00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:18.260 Jenny Duan: got it. And then how's the talk with Nicholas been going? Do you have any updates on that? Oh, yeah. He asked me to send the resume 23 00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:28.350 huda: resume and he said he was looking for like industry professionals, or like people who are like established in AI ethics. 24 00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.669 Jenny Duan: Okay? And so he said, no. 25 00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:41.129 huda: he said, oh, like I'd be glad to connect you to. So like other people, though. 26 00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.900 huda: Oh, okay, that's see, that's good. Who did he want to connect you with 27 00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.449 huda: wait, let me.

But so like 28 00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.350 huda: I'll connect you with some more 29 00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.150 huda: going on the Internet. 30 00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.529 Jenny Duan: Do you wanna share your screen. Show me, or Who is this person or these organizations? 31 00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.609 huda: Oh, I think he said, yeah, I think, he said. 32 00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:35.170 huda: I'm happy to connect you to anchor just as chapter chapter network lead. If you're interested in joining a chapter on beginning. 33 00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.020 Jenny Duan: Okay? 34 00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.960 Jenny Duan: I think maybe joining a chapter is not a exciting thing. 35 00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.600 Jenny Duan: but actually, why not ask him to connect to you and see where you can go from? There? 36 00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.839 Jenny Duan: you just say like that sounds good. Thank you so much.

You can just respond to him right now. 38 00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.740 Jenny Duan: Okay. 39 00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.279 Jenny Duan: yeah.

So the chemistry teacher agreed to write your application for the Free Spirit Conference. How's that going? 43 00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:16.720 huda: Yeah. So you just ask for the due date. I might have told them it was March fourteenth. So that kind of there's like some leeway. So that I'll have it at least a day before. 44 00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.650 huda: And 45 00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.339 huda: and then yeah. So I think he's working on it right now. Probably send that later on. 46 00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:35.769 huda: Probably send a like a follow up email this week like in the middle of this week. Maybe if he doesn't send it back then and just ask them, like, how things are going? 47 00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.440 huda: Yeah. 48 00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:53.270 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's maybe look at the application. Just your end of the application to make sure that you're prepared. And also for the NYUG. Stem. Let's also look at that, because I also have a deadline of the fifteenth. So 49 00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:01.080 Jenny Duan: I want to just really look quickly like, look over those programs. But also, do you have any updates on whether or not you were able to talk to your councillor or your vice principal. 50 00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:20.899 huda: So I've been working on like getting a meeting of my vice principal. So they haven't responded, but I think I'll try to thank you. I don't. I'm not sure who her second secretary is. But I could probably like find that out by switching it up. But 51 00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.569 huda: yeah, I'll probably try and reach out to them, and they can set up a meeting, maybe 52 00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.610 Jenny Duan: always sounds good. I think the deadline for that award 53 00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.390 Jenny Duan: is 54 00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.469 Jenny Duan: April fifth. So as long as you can get it within the next month you should be good. 55 00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.499 Jenny Duan: Go ahead. 56 00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.710 Jenny Duan: Let's try it. Start online application for the can you preview the essays. 57 00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:55.270 huda: Yeah, I think the essays are here. They're not on the application. Okay. 58 00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.530 Jenny Duan: what else do you need to apply? Besides the essays? 59 00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:10.499 huda: Need to share how the journalistic work? just so like census of information. 60 00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.140 huda: And 61 00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.340 huda: yeah, it's like, the only thanks any. 62 00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.429 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you have, I need 3 journalistic work samples. 63 00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.009 huda: Do you have? Do you have samples that you're gonna submit? Have you picked those yet? 64 00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:35.020 huda: Yeah, I could do some articles from full cliff like, maybe, like my interviews with small businesses. 65 00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.629 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then do you have anything from student journalism? Cloud. 66 00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.000 huda: and I have videos. 67 00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:50.150 huda: But they're kind of casual, so I don't know if I should show that. But yeah. 68 00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.230 Jenny Duan: oh, yeah, I think whatever 69 00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.620 huda: I think that's fine, too, though, like your book pages carol online content. 70 00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.610 Jenny Duan: classroom journalism was silence. 71 00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.789 Jenny Duan: Anything that you think is shows like this 72 00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.880 courage, or like. 73 00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:15.100 huda: I made a documentary before. So I could probably put that in 74 00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.499 Jenny Duan: perfect. Yep. Sounds good. 75 00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.419 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait. A couple of 2 essays. 76 00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:29.270 Jenny Duan: very. 77 00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.050 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. 78 00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:42.459 Jenny Duan: 2, 2 essays. Yeah. 2 essays. Your interest and passion for journalism. And then what characteristics make you a free spirit? 79 00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:50.819 Jenny Duan: Okay? And they're each 500 words each. And then the journalistic work samples. It can be newsreading photography, audio, video or other media. 80 00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.030 Jenny Duan: You can 81 00:09:52.240 --> 00:10:00.450 Jenny Duan: upload it as links or attach Pdfs, okay, can you start a document really quickly for your essays. 82 00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.840 huda: I'll go away. Other accounts. 83 00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.410 Jenny Duan: Chisholm. 84 00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.100 huda: Alright. I think we should. 85 00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Okay, just got it. Let me get it on that right now. 86 00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:53.969 Jenny Duan: Okay. I feel like for the first essay question, can you copy paste that essay questions into this document as well? 87 00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.430 Jenny Duan: They should be on the fa of the other of the web site. Oh, wait! No, they're already there. 88 00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.509 Jenny Duan: No right. Never mind. They're already here. 89 00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.969 Jenny Duan: For this first essay. Ii feel like you already. Have. 90 00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:15.010 Jenny Duan: Did you write something similar for either the Princeton program or the Jcap program? 91 00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:27.289 huda: Like, what got you interested in journalism or storytelling? Yeah, II think so. 92 00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.200 huda: no question that one. 93 00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.840 Jenny Duan: Alright. 94 00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.870 Do. Do they send you a copy of your application? 95 00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.670 huda: No, wait. Let me check if I won't look for Jcmal, because it does something familiar. 96 00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.680 Jenny Duan: Okay? 97 00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.960 Oh, maybe I could use this 98 00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.700 huda: the first estate. And instead of like. 99 00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.990 huda: Oh, yeah, perfect. 100 00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.490 Yeah. 101 00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.029 Jenny Duan: Can you 102 00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.459 Jenny Duan: paste it into this one? 103 00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.480 huda: Yeah. So 104 00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.240 Jenny Duan: do we just not extend this to 500 words thumbs. 105 00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.779 huda: Oh, it's only 151. 106 00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.079 Jenny Duan: Okay. I think this is fine, like, I think. 107 00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:25.230 Jenny Duan: this, you can just continue this analogy a little bit more like, I think, in previous iterations of your Jk. Esses, if you look at the history like you have a longer version with this essay, because I know. I remember we had to cut a lot for this, so 108 00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:32.660 Jenny Duan: you can take some of the details you've had in the previous iteration. And I think. 109 00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:46.870 Jenny Duan: Just extend that, and then spend the last part talking about like how you've developed this passion sort of not only what's inspired you in the past, but like how? How you've like grown your passion for journalism. So talk a little bit about 110 00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.720 Jenny Duan: how you've grown! I'll put this on his dog. 111 00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:56.770 Jenny Duan: and let me teach student loot news and 112 00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.750 Jenny Duan: documentary award and journalism club. 113 00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.090 Jenny Duan: and then little folklore 114 00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.810 Jenny Duan: storytelling through different mediums. 115 00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.350 Jenny Duan: code written articles. 116 00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.710 Jenny Duan: documentary 117 00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.420 Jenny Duan: what happens? 118 00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.390 Jenny Duan: And 119 00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:53.130 Jenny Duan: oh, yeah, I think that. So you should spend like, maybe the half the first half of this essay talking about writing like the context about, you know 120 00:15:53.140 --> 00:16:09.099 Jenny Duan: this Fariza Kariakai. And then the second half talking about how you've actually developed that passion for journalism. So you should name drop, like all the things that you've done in a documentary, in in the student news, 121 00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:24.110 Jenny Duan: in journalism, club and folklift, and like, you can emphasize storytelling through different forms, because I feel like you've done a lot with code written articles and even like documentaries. So I think that that's all like quite valuable. And you can take advantage of that. 122 00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:28.019 Jenny Duan: I think you can also like 123 00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:35.089 Jenny Duan: right about you could write about some of your coding projects like the and Manhattan's chops 124 00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.769 huda: board. 125 00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:48.320 Jenny Duan: and then some of your other coding projects as well. I think he's an old tale, because all of your websites and stuff, but that's also a form of like visual communication. 2. 126 00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.150 Jenny Duan: yeah. 127 00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.800 Jenny Duan: Okay. 128 00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:02.950 Jenny Duan: I feel like this. One should be pretty straightforward. Do you have any questions about how to structure this or how to make it longer. 129 00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:10.920 huda: No, I can. I'll send you any questions. I thought. I'm starting to write it, cause, I think. 130 00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:16.829 huda: explaining who he is. I definitely want to do that with the last essay. But yeah, I think I'll 131 00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.120 huda: I think I'll get to explain here. 132 00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:32.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Sounds good. I think that you've got this and just send me this essay, or like tag me like, make a comment and tag me when you're done, and I can look at it. Then. 133 00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.599 Jenny Duan: alright, let's talk about the second one. 134 00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:47.440 Jenny Duan: Secondly, what characteristics make you a free spirit? Bye. okay, do you have any ideas about this? 135 00:17:48.970 --> 00:18:00.769 huda: so it's kind of talking about like leadership and 136 00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:17.360 huda: like risk taking and innovative thinking. So I'm thinking like not to just reuse every essence. But we could probably take some elements from the Bank of America essays about like being a leader. And 137 00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:34.209 huda: I know we've used this one before. But the essay about like about like the girls in the club, like having not getting like President roles, or like any office rules, for that matter. Maybe we could use that. But I don't know. Maybe that's 138 00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:41.799 huda: oh, but I can also like emphasize like how? since I started phone Club. There's like. 139 00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.959 huda: well, I guess it's kind of wrong if I sit for my true passion. 140 00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.400 huda: And not that was like. But 141 00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:58.389 huda: yeah, like a good emphasis that's like filmmakers club. And how I found, like my community through like 142 00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.659 huda: filmmakers, club and 143 00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:08.149 huda: and I was able to like lead or like, grow those people? Maybe. 144 00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.109 Jenny Duan: I'm wondering like, do you? 145 00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:23.170 Jenny Duan: Do you have any other stories that you could talk about? Cause. I think they want something like quite out of the box for this one, if that makes sense like, I think they want like a 146 00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.720 Jenny Duan: like something like very different. 147 00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:33.319 Jenny Duan: That shows the kind, because I think, but while the while those both of those stories are really powerful, I don't think it's 148 00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:42.609 Jenny Duan: like that different. You know anything. Any one could be right about that which is not necessarily like a bad thing. But if there's something else that's more 149 00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.789 Jenny Duan: wave more out of the box. That would be good. 150 00:19:52.680 --> 00:20:02.350 huda: like 151 00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:12.720 huda: So like we're taking like, would it be like which one should we kind of focus on for the characteristics, because then maybe I can think of a more specific 152 00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.290 huda: sorry. 153 00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.770 Jenny Duan: like maybe a combination of like leadership, courage. 154 00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.410 Jenny Duan: and eviden their thinking 155 00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:31.960 Jenny Duan: honestly, I don't think the girl's example. I don't think the club's example is a bad one, like I think it's still a good example. 156 00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:40.040 Jenny Duan: I think it's it's fine if that's like what we end up going with. But I let's I just wanna challenge you to see if there's anything 157 00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.900 Jenny Duan: else first. 158 00:20:42.790 --> 00:21:10.760 huda: I kind of keep like connecting it to my extracurriculars. But 159 00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.079 huda: if like, if I'm able to talk about like 160 00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:30.839 huda: like booklift because we interview and like make like videos for small businesses. Just kind of unheard of. And then and then maybe like a specific instance which I think is like really different 161 00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:51.640 huda: was we had like a lady. She was like a matchmaking business, and she wanted to make videos, and I'm sure and do it and let the style those like Netflix shows, and we're able to like like I guess. Adjust for like medium that she wanted. And that was like a really creative way to get her business like out there. And like, know my people. 162 00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:08.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's that's really cool. How would you describe? That's, I think, the efficacy here is this, to accomplish something extraordinary. Can you describe what is extraordinary about that experience like what thought? It makes it so different. 163 00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.389 huda: I think just like the whole 164 00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.139 huda: like 165 00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:23.939 huda: the whole, like thing that like fake it to you, make it and like a lot of like small businesses. Obviously, they're not going to get the same unlike 166 00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:34.209 huda: like recording like. So, for example, there's like a show on Netflix, it's called Indian match making, and 167 00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:58.070 huda: so good and business out there 168 00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.099 huda: like small businesses like the one that I interviewed. 169 00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:08.690 huda: They don't have like ways to advertise their businesses. This fall, and I think like 170 00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:19.430 huda: was extraordinary is like making like making her seem like basically like another seema. But like, even though she's a small business. 171 00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:28.760 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. do you have any other examples undermined about something like extraordinary? 172 00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:38.190 Jenny Duan: I like the idea. I'm just wondering, like, also opened up to other things potentially. 173 00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:28.079 huda: Okay, this one's sorry. This one great idea. But when I was like, 7 or yeah. 7. We had to like, choose a famous person to do a biography on. And then I chose Steve Jobs and and like, I think 174 00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:50.990 huda: was extraordinary about that is like as a kid. I focus more on like who he was as a person when I was like talking about him, cause a lot of my classmates and stuff for account, Keller, and like they did different, like people like Obama. And they talked about more of their job. And then, like, I think, I focus more about like who he is and like what makes him special and 175 00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.860 huda: and like, I think that's like a big part of journalism like 176 00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:00.610 huda: like telling the person's story more than just their accomplishments, I guess. 177 00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:06.600 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's really good. Do you have another example of that in like your 178 00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:16.079 Jenny Duan: I admit that you can go off of that, and then transition into your small business folklift example. 179 00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:36.749 Jenny Duan: I think that's a good angle? 180 00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:43.639 Jenny Duan: And then do you have any other examples of challenging authority like, have you ever challenged authority in any way? 181 00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:55.240 huda: I mean. 182 00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:04.570 huda: I guess I kind of challenge my counselor, but I don't know if I have anything else. 183 00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:17.740 Jenny Duan: for the very heart could also be like a good gladness through which to write. You could write it this essay. 184 00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.440 huda: Yeah, 185 00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.500 huda: I could. 186 00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:33.220 huda: I mean, maybe like like through activism. For like 187 00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:43.450 huda: I mean, I don't know if we should write about that, but like, it's just like it's not really widely accepted. And 188 00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:50.500 huda: stop and like writing poetry and like information about posting throughout the 189 00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.989 huda: all done conflict. 190 00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:07.729 Jenny Duan: I think that that that seems like a good thing to write about, too, because they want you to do something like way different. So I think it's fine to write about Palestine, because I think that that's that's fine. 191 00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:21.899 Jenny Duan: I think you can connect this even to the folklift story like you can just add a little bit about, like maybe writing about topics that are unaddressed or like 192 00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.490 Jenny Duan: heavily polarized media. 193 00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.700 huda: And yeah. 194 00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.059 Jenny Duan: let's see anything else that you feel like you've done. That's like that has been very scary or different. 195 00:27:42.130 --> 00:28:08.160 huda: like scary in terms of like 196 00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.410 huda: Like going against authority. 197 00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:19.300 Not necessarily like just something that you've fraud like that has been personally really challenging for you 198 00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.230 huda: and 199 00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.490 huda: challenging. 200 00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:23.090 Jenny Duan: I think maybe this is a good start, and then we can go from here after the essays drafted and see it. But I think it's fine. If you talk about like your work founding a community organization so like mention that you are the creator of folklore, because I think that's really powerful. 201 00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:31.860 Jenny Duan: I also think, like being talking about how you have decided to champion like a controversial cause, could also be like quite powerful. 202 00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:39.710 Jenny Duan: I've been talking to you about folklore. Let me talk about Palestine through that lens. okay, cool. 203 00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:45.390 Jenny Duan: I think. Next, can you make another document and 204 00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.750 Jenny Duan: talk about? Let's talk about Chase. 205 00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.460 Jenny Duan: Gstab, the Nyu program. 206 00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.569 Jenny Duan: and then, do you have 207 00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:11.550 Jenny Duan: yet you already have a lot of recommendations for this, and you already asked your success teacher for this one. 208 00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.110 huda: Yes. 209 00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.230 Jenny Duan: alright, cool. perfect. 210 00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.789 huda: Okay, I should talk with you.

That's fine. 222 00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.900 Jenny Duan: Think it's worth. 223 00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.010 Okay? 224 00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.829 huda: I copied all the prompts to the deck. 225 00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:59.359 Jenny Duan: Hi, cool. link it on top. 226 00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.239 Jenny Duan: How many words are introduced? 227 00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:28.769 huda: 500.

Oh, my mom came. 251 00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:45.670 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, all good. Some you can talk about like your lack of resources, maybe, or like your challenges with the club, or like reaching teachers like those, are all all the things. Imagine like how your town is like kind of rural, and like 252 00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:53.920 Jenny Duan: not that many he has opportunities. And then you can talk about like creating your own spaces. 253 00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.619 Jenny Duan: including slash finding like your own spaces. 254 00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:09.840 Jenny Duan: I think this one is lost to like. Remember the Carnegie Mellon the beginning of that when he talked about the farm farming town. Maybe I don't know if you want to go with that. But that could be like a potential thing to incorporate into this essay. 255 00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.970 huda: Yeah, I think for sure, really? Well. 256 00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:19.839 Jenny Duan: yeah.

Maybe like looking at your website analytics? 260 00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:38.359 huda: Yeah. I mean, maybe Mhd jobs where I did work with like a bunch of data collection. And 261 00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:44.370 huda: although there was to like a no code website. I think I like learned kind of like. 262 00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:48.560 huda: like process data from one end and then like display it. 263 00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.420 huda: And 264 00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.060 huda: I guess also. 265 00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:04.740 huda: maybe next week we're gonna be like building an AI like model thing for the kids. 266 00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:10.220 huda: maybe that's like, not. But we'll need 2 things that time. Page related. Okay. 267 00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.619 Jenny Duan: okay, cool.

But maybe like 276 00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:17.760 huda: for example, like. 277 00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:34.349 huda: okay, this is also kind of AI, but maybe like, say, you're looking for which copy place to go and then like, it shows like data from like people that have their similar tastes.

So like also II saw that your game was featured on the interchange forecast. Did you get a lot of attention through that like, how did that go? Yeah, I think especially since I like we posted and like wrote under founders posts, a lot of like other Ceos, and everything were like commenting and connecting with me. 10 00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:46.049 huda: And I think that's really cool. And I got to like chat with like a few other founders. And we do a podcast as well. 11 00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.729 huda: and yeah. So I ",
    "think it was really nice. I think I'm gonna continue posting about a little bit more. But 12 00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.060 huda: yeah, it was. It was like, make a lot of connections from that. 13 00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.930 Jenny Duan: And how is your linkedin like connections been going? 14 00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:28.879 huda: Yeah, I've been so I reached out to the well, I connected to like a bunch of people in the game development industry to reach out. Then a message like 3 women in game development. And so like, I kinda asked about like their journey and everything. They haven't responded. But I think I think I can 15 00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:39.989 huda: try to reach out to like kind of more local people. And yeah. So I think I've been, I've been connecting with a lot of people. But 16 00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.970 huda: yeah, like, I haven't got to call with it. 17 00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.269 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome.

But 21 00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.449 huda: yeah, I could probably message more people. I think that'd be better 22 00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:18.260 Jenny Duan: got it. And then how's the talk with Nicholas been going? Do you have any updates on that? Oh, yeah. He asked me to send the resume 23 00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:28.350 huda: resume and he said he was looking for like industry professionals, or like people who are like established in AI ethics. 24 00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.669 Jenny Duan: Okay?

There? 36 00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.839 Jenny Duan: you just say like that sounds good. Thank you so much.

I might have told them it was March fourteenth. So that kind of there's like some leeway. So that I'll have it at least a day before. 44 00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.650 huda: And 45 00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.339 huda: and then yeah. So I think he's working on it right now. Probably send that later on. 4",
    "6 00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:35.769 huda: Probably send a like a follow up email this week like in the middle of this week. Maybe if he doesn't send it back then and just ask them, like, how things are going? 47 00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.440 huda: Yeah. 48 00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:53.270 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's maybe look at the application. Just your end of the application to make sure that you're prepared. And also for the NYUG. Stem. Let's also look at that, because I also have a deadline of the fifteenth.

So they haven't responded, but I think I'll try to thank you. I don't. I'm not sure who her second secretary is. But I could probably like find that out by switching it up. But 51 00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.569 huda: yeah, I'll probably try and reach out to them, and they can set up a meeting, maybe 52 00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.610 Jenny Duan: always sounds good. I think the deadline for that award 53 00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.390 Jenny Duan: is 54 00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.469 Jenny Duan: April fifth.

Do you have samples that you're gonna submit? Have you picked those yet? 64 00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:35.020 huda: Yeah, I could do some articles from full cliff like, maybe, like my interviews with small businesses. 65 00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.629 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then do you have anything from student journalism? Cloud. 66 00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.000 huda: and I have videos. 67 00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:50.150 huda: But they're kind of casual, so I don't know if I should show that. But yeah. 68 00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.230 Jenny Duan: oh, yeah, I think whatever 69 00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.620 huda: I think that's fine, too, though, like your book pages carol online content. 70 00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.610 Jenny Duan: classroom journalism was silence. 71 00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.789 Jenny Duan: Anything that you think is shows like this 72 00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.880 courage, or like. 73 00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:15.100 huda: I made a documentary before. So I could probably put that in 74 00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.499 Jenny Duan: perfect. Yep. Sounds good. 75 00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.419 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait. A couple of 2 essays. 76 00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:29.270 Jenny Duan: very. 77 00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.050 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. 78 00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:42.459 Jenny Duan: 2, 2 essays.

And then the journalistic work samples. It can be newsreading photography, audio, video or other media. 80 00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.030 Jenny Duan: You can 81 00:09:52.240 --> 00:10:00.450 Jenny Duan: upload it as links or attach Pdfs, okay, can you start a document really quic",

I think we should. 85 00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Okay, just got it. Let me get it on that right now. 86 00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:53.969 Jenny Duan: Okay. I feel like for the first essay question, can you copy paste that essay questions into this document as well? 87 00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.430 Jenny Duan: They should be on the fa of the other of the web site. Oh, wait! No, they're already there. 88 00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.509 Jenny Duan: No right. Never mind. They're already here. 89 00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.969 Jenny Duan: For this first essay. Ii feel like you already. Have. 90 00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:15.010 Jenny Duan: Did you write something similar for either the Princeton program or the Jcap program? 91 00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:27.289 huda: Like, what got you interested in journalism or storytelling? Yeah, II think so. 92 00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.200 huda: no question that one. 93 00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.840 Jenny Duan: Alright. 94 00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.870 Do. Do they send you a copy of your application? 95 00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.670 huda: No, wait. Let me check if I won't look for Jcmal, because it does something familiar. 96 00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.680 Jenny Duan: Okay? 97 00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.960 Oh, maybe I could use this 98 00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.700 huda: the first estate. And instead of like. 99 00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.990 huda: Oh, yeah, perfect. 100 00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.490 Yeah. 101 00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.029 Jenny Duan: Can you 102 00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.459 Jenny Duan: paste it into this one? 103 00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.480 huda: Yeah. So 104 00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.240 Jenny Duan: do we just not extend this to 500 words thumbs. 105 00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.779 huda: Oh, it's only 151. 106 00:1",
    "4:06.840 --> 00:14:10.079 Jenny Duan: Okay. I think this is fine, like, I think. 107 00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:25.230 Jenny Duan: this, you can just continue this analogy a little bit more like, I think, in previous iterations of your Jk. Esses, if you look at the history like you have a longer version with this essay, because I know. I remember we had to cut a lot for this, so 108 00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:32.660 Jenny Duan: you can take some of the details you've had in the previous iteration. And I think. 109 00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:46.870 Jenny Duan: Just extend that, and then spend the last part talking about like how you've developed this passion sort of not only what's inspired you in the past, but like how? How you've like grown your passion for journalism. So talk a little bit about 110 00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.720 Jenny Duan: how you've grown! I'll put this on his dog. 111 00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:56.770 Jenny Duan: and let me teach student loot news and 112 00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.750 Jenny Duan: documentary award and journalism club. 113 00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.090 Jenny Duan: and then little folklore 114 00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.810 Jenny Duan: storytelling through different mediums. 115 00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.350 Jenny Duan: code written articles. 116 00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.710 Jenny Duan: documentary 117 00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.420 Jenny Duan: what happens? 118 00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.390 Jenny Duan: And 119 00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:53.130 Jenny Duan: oh, yeah, I think that. So you should spend like, maybe the half the first half of this essay talking about writing like the context about, you know 120 00:15:53.140 --> 00:16:09.099 Jenny Duan: this Fariza Kariakai. And then the second half talking about how you've actually developed that passion for journalism. So you should name drop, like all the things that you've done in a documentary, in in the student news, 121 00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:24.110 Jenny Duan: in journalism, club and folklift, and l",
    "ike, you can emphasize storytelling through different forms, because I feel like you've done a lot with code written articles and even like documentaries. So I think that that's all like quite valuable. And you can take advantage of that. 122 00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:28.019 Jenny Duan: I think you can also like 123 00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:35.089 Jenny Duan: right about you could write about some of your coding projects like the and Manhattan's chops 124 00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.769 huda: board. 125 00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:48.320 Jenny Duan: and then some of your other coding projects as well. I think he's an old tale, because all of your websites and stuff, but that's also a form of like visual communication. 2. 126 00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.150 Jenny Duan: yeah. 127 00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.800 Jenny Duan: Okay. 128 00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:02.950 Jenny Duan: I feel like this. One should be pretty straightforward. Do you have any questions about how to structure this or how to make it longer. 129 00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:10.920 huda: No, I can. I'll send you any questions. I thought. I'm starting to write it, cause, I think. 130 00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:16.829 huda: explaining who he is. I definitely want to do that with the last essay. But yeah, I think I'll 131 00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.120 huda: I think I'll get to explain here. 132 00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:32.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Sounds good. I think that you've got this and just send me this essay, or like tag me like, make a comment and tag me when you're done, and I can look at it. Then. 133 00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.599 Jenny Duan: alright, let's talk about the second one. 134 00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:47.440 Jenny Duan: Secondly, what characteristics make you a free spirit? Bye. okay, do you have any ideas about this? 135 00:17:48.970 --> 00:18:00.769 huda: so it's kind of talking about like leadership and 136 00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:17.360 huda: like risk taking and innovative thinking. So I'm thinking like not ",
    "to just reuse every essence. But we could probably take some elements from the Bank of America essays about like being a leader. And 137 00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:34.209 huda: I know we've used this one before. But the essay about like about like the girls in the club, like having not getting like President roles, or like any office rules, for that matter. Maybe we could use that. But I don't know. Maybe that's 138 00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:41.799 huda: oh, but I can also like emphasize like how? since I started phone Club. There's like. 139 00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.959 huda: well, I guess it's kind of wrong if I sit for my true passion. 140 00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.400 huda: And not that was like. But 141 00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:58.389 huda: yeah, like a good emphasis that's like filmmakers club. And how I found, like my community through like 142 00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.659 huda: filmmakers, club and 143 00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:08.149 huda: and I was able to like lead or like, grow those people? Maybe. 144 00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.109 Jenny Duan: I'm wondering like, do you? 145 00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:23.170 Jenny Duan: Do you have any other stories that you could talk about? Cause. I think they want something like quite out of the box for this one, if that makes sense like, I think they want like a 146 00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.720 Jenny Duan: like something like very different. 147 00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:33.319 Jenny Duan: That shows the kind, because I think, but while the while those both of those stories are really powerful, I don't think it's 148 00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:42.609 Jenny Duan: like that different. You know anything. Any one could be right about that which is not necessarily like a bad thing. But if there's something else that's more 149 00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.789 Jenny Duan: wave more out of the box. That would be good. 150 00:19:52.680 --> 00:20:02.350 huda: like 151 00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:12.720 huda: So like we're taking like, would it be like w",
    "hich one should we kind of focus on for the characteristics, because then maybe I can think of a more specific 152 00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.290 huda: sorry. 153 00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.770 Jenny Duan: like maybe a combination of like leadership, courage. 154 00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.410 Jenny Duan: and eviden their thinking 155 00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:31.960 Jenny Duan: honestly, I don't think the girl's example. I don't think the club's example is a bad one, like I think it's still a good example. 156 00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:40.040 Jenny Duan: I think it's it's fine if that's like what we end up going with. But I let's I just wanna challenge you to see if there's anything 157 00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.900 Jenny Duan: else first. 158 00:20:42.790 --> 00:21:10.760 huda: I kind of keep like connecting it to my extracurriculars. But 159 00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.079 huda: if like, if I'm able to talk about like 160 00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:30.839 huda: like booklift because we interview and like make like videos for small businesses. Just kind of unheard of. And then and then maybe like a specific instance which I think is like really different 161 00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:51.640 huda: was we had like a lady. She was like a matchmaking business, and she wanted to make videos, and I'm sure and do it and let the style those like Netflix shows, and we're able to like like I guess. Adjust for like medium that she wanted. And that was like a really creative way to get her business like out there. And like, know my people. 162 00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:08.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's that's really cool. How would you describe? That's, I think, the efficacy here is this, to accomplish something extraordinary. Can you describe what is extraordinary about that experience like what thought? It makes it so different. 163 00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.389 huda: I think just like the whole 164 00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.139 huda: like 165 00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:23.939 huda: the whole",
    ", like thing that like fake it to you, make it and like a lot of like small businesses. Obviously, they're not going to get the same unlike 166 00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:34.209 huda: like recording like. So, for example, there's like a show on Netflix, it's called Indian match making, and 167 00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:58.070 huda: so good and business out there 168 00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.099 huda: like small businesses like the one that I interviewed. 169 00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:08.690 huda: They don't have like ways to advertise their businesses. This fall, and I think like 170 00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:19.430 huda: was extraordinary is like making like making her seem like basically like another seema. But like, even though she's a small business. 171 00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:28.760 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. do you have any other examples undermined about something like extraordinary? 172 00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:38.190 Jenny Duan: I like the idea. I'm just wondering, like, also opened up to other things potentially. 173 00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:28.079 huda: Okay, this one's sorry. This one great idea. But when I was like, 7 or yeah. 7. We had to like, choose a famous person to do a biography on. And then I chose Steve Jobs and and like, I think 174 00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:50.990 huda: was extraordinary about that is like as a kid. I focus more on like who he was as a person when I was like talking about him, cause a lot of my classmates and stuff for account, Keller, and like they did different, like people like Obama. And they talked about more of their job. And then, like, I think, I focus more about like who he is and like what makes him special and 175 00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.860 huda: and like, I think that's like a big part of journalism like 176 00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:00.610 huda: like telling the person's story more than just their accomplishments, I guess. 177 00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:06.600 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's really good. Do you have another example of t",
    "hat in like your 178 00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:16.079 Jenny Duan: I admit that you can go off of that, and then transition into your small business folklift example. 179 00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:36.749 Jenny Duan: I think that's a good angle? 180 00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:43.639 Jenny Duan: And then do you have any other examples of challenging authority like, have you ever challenged authority in any way? 181 00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:55.240 huda: I mean. 182 00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:04.570 huda: I guess I kind of challenge my counselor, but I don't know if I have anything else. 183 00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:17.740 Jenny Duan: for the very heart could also be like a good gladness through which to write. You could write it this essay. 184 00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.440 huda: Yeah, 185 00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.500 huda: I could. 186 00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:33.220 huda: I mean, maybe like like through activism. For like 187 00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:43.450 huda: I mean, I don't know if we should write about that, but like, it's just like it's not really widely accepted. And 188 00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:50.500 huda: stop and like writing poetry and like information about posting throughout the 189 00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.989 huda: all done conflict. 190 00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:07.729 Jenny Duan: I think that that that seems like a good thing to write about, too, because they want you to do something like way different. So I think it's fine to write about Palestine, because I think that that's that's fine. 191 00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:21.899 Jenny Duan: I think you can connect this even to the folklift story like you can just add a little bit about, like maybe writing about topics that are unaddressed or like 192 00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.490 Jenny Duan: heavily polarized media. 193 00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.700 huda: And yeah. 194 00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.059 Jenny Duan: let's see anything else that you feel like you've done. That's like that has been very scary or different. 195 00:27:42.1",
    "30 --> 00:28:08.160 huda: like scary in terms of like 196 00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.410 huda: Like going against authority. 197 00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:19.300 Not necessarily like just something that you've fraud like that has been personally really challenging for you 198 00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.230 huda: and 199 00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.490 huda: challenging. 200 00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:23.090 Jenny Duan: I think maybe this is a good start, and then we can go from here after the essays drafted and see it. But I think it's fine. If you talk about like your work founding a community organization so like mention that you are the creator of folklore, because I think that's really powerful. 201 00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:31.860 Jenny Duan: I also think, like being talking about how you have decided to champion like a controversial cause, could also be like quite powerful. 202 00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:39.710 Jenny Duan: I've been talking to you about folklore. Let me talk about Palestine through that lens. okay, cool. 203 00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:45.390 Jenny Duan: I think. Next, can you make another document and 204 00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.750 Jenny Duan: talk about? Let's talk about Chase. 205 00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.460 Jenny Duan: Gstab, the Nyu program. 206 00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.569 Jenny Duan: and then, do you have 207 00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:11.550 Jenny Duan: yet you already have a lot of recommendations for this, and you already asked your success teacher for this one. 208 00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.110 huda: Yes. 209 00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.230 Jenny Duan: alright, cool. perfect. 210 00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.789 huda: Okay, I should talk with you.
