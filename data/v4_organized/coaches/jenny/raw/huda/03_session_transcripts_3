How are you? 2 00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.480 huda: Hello! 3 00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.359 Ivy Mentors: Why are you laughing? 4 00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.360 And 5 00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.209 Ivy Mentors: I'm good. I will. I'm gonna see your progress. Huh! 6 00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.840 Ivy Mentors: Zoom is quite better actually, compared to. 7 00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.819 huda: you know, there, there's apps so that you could take notes of it. 8 00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.539 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I mean, I haven't integrated it. But the the video is anyways being. 9 00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:57.579 Ivy Mentors: I think you need to set up some, you know. Ask Jenny about some timer technique, right? Like alerts. 10 00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.059 Ivy Mentors: things like that. I think it's important to have some tracking tools or some 11 00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.180 Ivy Mentors: right. 12 00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.759 Ivy Mentors: especially when you're kind of zoned like, you know. I kind of forget all the time, so 13 00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.030 Ivy Mentors: why it so while it's so dark. Hello. 14 00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.960 Ivy Mentors: Hi, Jenny, how are you? 15 00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:41.199 Ivy Mentors: I'm doing? Well, it's good to see you. Yeah. Same here. I know that you're more excited to see who that I'm gonna leave. I I I'm gonna come back in half an hour, but apologies for yesterday, you know, it was terrible. But I think the Internet is back today. It's really good. 16 00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 17 00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.580 Ivy Mentors: cool. okay, I'll I'll leave. And I'll let you guys see, I'm so excited. 18 00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.550 Jenny Duan: Awesome. All right, Huda. Hi! How's it going? 19 00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.360 huda: I'm good. How are you? 20 00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.630 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. How is your first week of school? 21 00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:07.380 huda: Oh, sorry I forgot to message you. But yeah, I was good. I learned that I had the same teacher that I had last year. So 22 00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:16.029 huda: yeah, and that was good. And I think, yeah, I was going well, and I also secure my spot as like anchor for the 23 00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.049 huda: news again. So because it changes every year. So 24 00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.090 huda: yeah. 25 00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.010 Jenny Duan: same teacher, for what subject? But for Cs awesome. 26 00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.019 Jenny Duan: And are you taking a different Cs class this this year than you were last year. It's an Ap. Course. 27 00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.079 Jenny Duan: Oh, got you awesome 28 00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:48.199 Jenny Duan: And how did everything else go? How we like you for staff classes! Did you get to talk to your teachers. and how are the how is like the beginning of clubs? 29 00:03:48.810 --> 00:04:14.059 huda: Yeah. So for the clubs we figured out for Vfx. Hu. We figured out like who are going to be the rest of the offices, or at least we need 3 to start up a club. So we decided who the vice president and secretary are. And then I emailed the advisor about our our article show. Intelligent ethics. club. So yeah. 30 00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.999 huda: and I'm sure she'll say yes, because we, as we told her that 31 00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.489 huda: it won't be much of a time commitment, because it's just going to be during school. So 32 00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:33.189 Jenny Duan: yeah, awesome. Yeah. And then, how has the schedule been going? Has it been working? Has has it not been working? what are your thoughts on how that went. 33 00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:45.600 huda: Yeah, so I I track sticking to it as much as I can. But there are some things that I just couldn't work on this time this week like the video project since I don't really have 34 00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.689 huda: much to do. But I think I can start like reaching out to the small businesses instead of 35 00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:59.929 huda: but there is definitely for the game. At least I've been consistently working on it every day, for like at least 2 and a half hours or 3 h. 36 00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:12.590 huda: And the SSD, I've been doing the Khan Academy practice and I did the reading and writing test for the sat. But I didn't get to finish the whole thing, because 37 00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.599 huda: we unexpectedly like went somewhere. So yeah. 38 00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.839 Jenny Duan: gotcha, yeah, no problem. How's your sat going? By the way, do you have any idea about like what your score is at the moment? 39 00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.479 huda: Yeah. So right now, I have a third 1,360 40 00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.649 huda: but I think I'm I'm working on improving it, because the first time I took it I got like a 41 00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.200 huda: 1,000 42 00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:55.860 huda: I think it was like 1,150, and then The next time I took it was at 1,260, and this time is 1,367. And I see, like, consistent, like improvements. So yeah. 43 00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.900 Jenny Duan: that's awesome. And when are you taking it again? 44 00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.799 huda: October seventh? 45 00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.470 Jenny Duan: Okay, so in 2 months from now, okay. 46 00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:12.870 Jenny Duan: I think so, for the sat. I think now it might be a good time to like. Start really doubling down on your prep. Work for that, just because 47 00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:24.289 Jenny Duan: you're going to take the psat soon in the sat, and on the sat you. You need to get above a 1,550 so your goal should be to get like a 1550, or above 48 00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.590 Jenny Duan: and for the Psat, I think, for eligibility in your State 49 00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.520 Jenny Duan: you'll probably need to get a 1,500 or above out of 1520 50 00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:44.020 Jenny Duan: on the so those are some goals to work towards over the next 2 months for the Sat and PC team. 51 00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:56.830 Jenny Duan: But just so, that's like on your radar. That is like, pretty important. yeah. And then, were you able to talk to your Student Council about the Youth Action Committee thing. 52 00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:10.839 huda: Actually, I did not get to reach out to them. because I think I should probably follow up. But I did message the the advisor. And she didn't get back to me, I should probably follow up. 53 00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.930 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, no problem. And then, did you schedule a meeting with your counselor in the first week. 54 00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.390 huda: no, not yet. 55 00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.620 Jenny Duan: Okay. Why don't we make a note to do that? 56 00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:39.100 Jenny Duan: Just because that's going to be pretty important? just because your counselor also. One thing that people don't tell you about school is that your counselors will also write 57 00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.630 Jenny Duan: like a 58 00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:51.670 Jenny Duan: They have to sense information about the school to your to each college, and they also write like a short note about you to your colleges. So that's pretty important. 59 00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.700 Jenny Duan: and then some other news for this week is just that This is like. 60 00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:20.269 Jenny Duan: I guess, for future notice. But I just thought I would mention it. Harvard is actually changing like their essay formatting. So that's something interesting. we'll talk more about specifically writing college essays later on. But I'm curious to see how this is going to look like with other schools as well given like within the college admissions. Landscape over this past year, like a lot of things have changed and so 61 00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:30.220 Jenny Duan: I thought it might be interesting to talk about what that means for you. What means for us? So a couple of things like first. they're getting rid of affirmative action. 62 00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.700 Jenny Duan: in California. 63 00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:38.869 Jenny Duan: and well, not just in California, but just within the United States. And are you familiar with what affirmative action is. 64 00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:57.899 Jenny Duan: Okay? So they're getting rid of affirmative action. I'm not sure what this is gonna mean, for like admissions in general, because I think it's it's it's gonna mean that they're gonna look for culture in other places, which I again, I think this is why it's more important for you to write about your background, your religion and your culture. Because 65 00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.720 Jenny Duan: I think, like schools actually really look for that. 66 00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.830 Jenny Duan: And 67 00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.480 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that. That's, I think there's a common misconception that if you're 68 00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:15.639 Jenny Duan: like Asian, it's harder to get into like a good school, even for Cs. But I think that like, regardless of 69 00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:40.160 Jenny Duan: that stereotype or that perception, it's still really important to talk about your culture, because that's something that they look for a lot. So I don't think you should shy away from like talking about your background of like. That's something I wrote a lot of my essays on, and I think that that's something that like could be important for you to mention as well. Another major change again is that the sat and a Ct. And sorry the sat is going virtual, and your S is still going to be in person? Right? Yeah. 70 00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.089 Jenny Duan: okay. But are you familiar? Are you like, have you heard that the sat is going virtual. 71 00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:51.379 huda: Yeah, I actually want to try the digital set. but I'm not sure if you can register for it in the us. 72 00:09:52.130 --> 00:10:02.870 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm not sure if it's offered yet. But I think, like, hopefully, you get a good score on this one, and you want we'll have to retake it. But yeah, I'm also curious to see how the sat goes. 73 00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:16.910 Jenny Duan: virtually. And then the other thing is again like college and missions. Their essays are changing a lot so like Harvard's essays are changing, and I'm not sure if any of the other schools on your list essays are going to change in the future. But 74 00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:31.760 Jenny Duan: I think they're they're instead of doing like longer essays. They're bringing it down to like more shorter prompts, like a series of shorter essays kind of like how they use these are instead of like one long essay like common app. And then a couple of 75 00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.119 Jenny Duan: so yeah. anyways, another thing that I wanted to tell you about was 76 00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:45.500 Jenny Duan: Here, I've got down like I'm starting to populate your summer programs list, too. So 77 00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:54.320 Jenny Duan: this is something that I wanted to show you that we can apply for the deadline. The application is not open, but it's gonna be 78 00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:05.950 Jenny Duan: some time in like the winter spring. But this is like an AI scholars program at Carnegie Mellon, and I don't know if if Cmu is on your list. But have you ever thought about going there. 79 00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:12.119 huda: Yeah, for sure, it's a really great like, engineering college. So 80 00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.670 Jenny Duan: yeah, so this is like an 81 00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.290 Jenny Duan: yeah ethics, sort of school. So 82 00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:27.059 Jenny Duan: it's it's about computer science and AI, and you'll apply it 83 00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:43.099 Jenny Duan: it to use. You apply it to a project that uses artificial intelligence for the betterment of humanity. And so I think this is really in line with some of the things that we're talking about your focus on, and some of the things that you're interested in. So I'm just gonna put this on your radar. 84 00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that sounds like a really good program. 85 00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.490 huda: I'm definitely 86 00:11:49.780 --> 00:12:03.820 Jenny Duan: yeah. And it's you must be a current junior. So you're gonna be eligible next year, or like this year. But, like next, you know, year for the application, and it's 4 weeks at Cmu, and it's free. 87 00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:16.139 Jenny Duan: So it'll be like a pre-college type of program. But it's like free. So it's that's pretty cool. yeah. So I thought that right now we could. Something that we can work on is 88 00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.589 Jenny Duan: populating like a gold tracker, because I think, like. 89 00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:30.790 Jenny Duan: I think we we have a bunch of, you know, a daily schedule, and we talked to a lot of things. But let's talk about some of setting some goals for the next school year. 90 00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.929 Jenny Duan: what? How do you? How do you feel about that? 91 00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:51.109 huda: Yeah, I could definitely cause since I'm taking the 4 aps this year. I'm like, the teachers have kind of been scaring us. So I could definitely like me plan out like goals for each class. 92 00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:59.950 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely. So just off the bat like before. I talk about some things that I think we should prioritize. What are some goals? 93 00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.090 Jenny Duan: that you have in mind? 94 00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:16.749 Jenny Duan: in terms of like academic. Maybe, like we can do academic. which would be like school extracurricular award. And then like just personal goals, too. 95 00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.129 huda: for academic 96 00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:38.999 huda: maybe try not to get a be like all year, because most of the time I've been in for semester. So I'm trying to like keep an A and both semesters for all my classes is that most of the time you have these in both in first semester. 97 00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:47.909 huda: Well, not for all my classes like, I have one B during the first semester, and then all A's and second semester. So I want to keep it like all these throughout. 98 00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.640 Jenny Duan: Okay, great! 99 00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.480 Jenny Duan: What was your be in 100 00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.950 huda: last year? It was for ap human geography. 101 00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.279 Jenny Duan: Did you get any easier freshman here? 102 00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.790 huda: The first semester I had a be an owner's bio. 103 00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:10.380 Jenny Duan: Okay? Awesome. And then do you have any other academic goals? 104 00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:18.860 huda: I guess. Just build like a stronger bond with my teachers this year? 105 00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.759 huda: like. So they know me better as a student 106 00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.420 huda: in person. 107 00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.570 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. 108 00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.390 Jenny Duan: And then do you have any other academic goals 109 00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.949 Jenny Duan: like? What do you have to go about your sat about psts, about ap testing anything like that? 110 00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.459 huda: Yeah. So I'd say, like, increase my score by like. 111 00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:52.549 huda: 200 points at a minute a month. And just 112 00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.139 huda: practice. Oh, sorry 113 00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:00.360 Jenny Duan: like. What does that mean? Like increase? Do you have a target score in mind. 114 00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.710 huda: I want to get like 1550 or higher 115 00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.280 huda: and definitely, I need to start like practicing more. So yeah. 116 00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.110 Jenny Duan: awesome. And then for Psat, do you have a goal? 117 00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.149 huda: like you said, I think, like a 1,500 118 00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.579 Jenny Duan: a good deal 119 00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.340 Jenny Duan: awesome. And then for your Aps, do you have a target for your Ap scores. 120 00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:36.940 huda: I'd want to get a 5 on every class. But I'm finally like for on some. But yeah. 121 00:15:37.960 --> 00:16:01.170 Jenny Duan: okay, amazing. And then the reason why we're writing these goals down is because, like being able to write them down and see them in front of you helps you work towards them better like it's kind of like an active, active manifestation where you're like, I'm writing this down. I'm going to do it. And I like, I'm visualizing it already. So that's why we're writing it down. Just so you can see on paper and know that, like these are the tangible things that we're trying to reach. 122 00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:09.850 Jenny Duan: and then extra credit wise. Do you have any goals? For you know any of the things that we talked about last week, or any of your project that you're working on. 123 00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:28.450 huda: Yeah. So I wanna be more involved with clubs this year, even if I'm just a member like just participating in like all the events just more involved in school clubs in which clubs let's get specific like Msa, speech and debate 124 00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.449 huda: taxpayers. Are you in speech and debate. 125 00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.120 Jenny Duan: What? What type of speech? And it like? What type of speech or debate do you do? 126 00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.280 huda: Oh, I do. original oratory speech! 127 00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.730 Jenny Duan: And how is that going? 128 00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:53.849 huda: Last year it was my first year doing it. So the speeches For one of them I actually ranked like a second 129 00:16:53.930 --> 00:17:04.560 huda: for the like. it was like a regional contest. It wasn't that serious, but because they have like 5 every single year. So yeah, I got second place for one of them. 130 00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:11.050 huda: and yeah, I think I want to continue this year. So are you serious about speech and debate? 131 00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:19.869 Jenny Duan: I did not know that you did this also. Okay, after this, can you send me a list of everything that you're involved in? 132 00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:32.829 huda: Yeah, the reason why I didn't really mention speech and debate is because it's I'm not exactly that interested in it. I want to be more involved so I can get more interested in it. But 133 00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.619 huda: I just feel like my delivery is not great, so I don't think I'd be that great at it. 134 00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, I see. 135 00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:51.420 Jenny Duan: are you so I think we should decide. If you're serious about pursuing speech and debate or not, because I think, if not. then I think 136 00:17:51.580 --> 00:18:18.220 Jenny Duan: you should not do speech and debate and focus your time on other things. But if you're serious about it, I think you should get a speech and debate coach and actually try to win like the politicians and like go hard on speech and debate. But I think that's something we have to decide. Because right now, I think if you're kind of floating through it, I don't think that's a good use of your time, because I think you could be sending that doing other things. But if you're serious about speech and debate, then I want to empower you to like, do that because I think that's really awesome. 137 00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:26.499 huda: Yeah. So I'd say, like, I'm not that interested. So maybe I wouldn't have to get as involved this year. 138 00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.630 huda: yeah. 139 00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.680 Jenny Duan: sounds good. 140 00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:47.130 huda: And also there's a U.S.A. Co. Team at my school, and I think I want to get involved in that competition. it's like a it's like a coding competition. Sometimes there'll be like worldwide U.S.A. Co competitions. 141 00:18:47.190 --> 00:19:01.509 Jenny Duan: So, oh, that sounds really, that sounds really awesome. And I think those worldwide U.S.A. code competitions are a really good way to get an international award like place. How easy or difficult is it to place at those competitions! 142 00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.879 huda: It's really hard, because it's like many people know about it. It's 143 00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.060 huda: Well, like one of the more popular clubs. 144 00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:18.649 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's awesome. Well, that sounds like something cool to get involved in. Are you like a competitive programmer at all like, do you do competitive programming? 145 00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:31.809 huda: I've done hackathons and such. But I've never done like I think U.S.A. Co. Is more like a problem solving thing like. It'll give you like a problem. And you have to make a code for it 146 00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.250 huda: rather than in like hackathon, or you just like make a product 147 00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.800 Jenny Duan: right? And are you serious about competitive coding? Which is, I think, what U.S.A. code is? 148 00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:52.370 huda: Yeah, I think like just seeing my potential, like I would like other competing with other programmers is is probably going to be encouraging to me. So yeah. 149 00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:59.259 Jenny Duan: awesome. Then I think that you can train for U.S.A. code and 150 00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:06.690 Jenny Duan: I'll I'll put some resources in our document for U.S.A. code training. But 151 00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.200 let's see. 152 00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:25.760 Jenny Duan: I think, like we code is a good place to start to learn data structures and algorithms. and then for practice, after you finish a bunch of lead codes like, there's other competitive programming websites that you can check out. 153 00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:33.930 Jenny Duan: But okay, that's something to think about. What else are you trying to get more involved with extracurricular wise. Is there anything else? 154 00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:45.040 huda: maybe just like working on my other passions like. 155 00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:53.340 huda: I don't know, like, specifically, but like definitely working on video projects. and 156 00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:02.450 huda: my video game development, I want to try to get it done before winter, or like, maybe in the middle of winter. 157 00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:12.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. And then for the for the video project, what is the concrete goal you have with the video project? 158 00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.570 huda: go to website, 159 00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.980 huda: and reach out to like at least 160 00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:27.989 huda: 3 other people that are interested in so and if they they could collaborate with me. 161 00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.230 Jenny Duan: yeah, awesome. And so then for the video game. Do you have any plans to like 162 00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.009 Jenny Duan: market that, or share your story with others? And in any way. 163 00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:53.069 huda: yeah, so I'm gonna work on like a dev log. while I'm making it, and try to post on and see if I could get any views on that. And other than that I'll probably like, make social media for it 164 00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.729 huda: and try to like market it on there. 165 00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.570 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how's your Youtube going? Have you thought about that at all. 166 00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.719 huda: Yeah. So I actually had an idea. 167 00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:16.649 huda: cause I know when I took a B hug I really wanted to like, I wash a lot of those videos for, like, how I got a 5 on the Ap hug exam. So I was thinking, like doing a Youtube video on that. So 168 00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.159 Jenny Duan: awesome. Sounds good. 169 00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah, cool. 170 00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.640 Jenny Duan: And then 171 00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:28.119 Jenny Duan: for your awards, do you have any specific ideas of what awards you want to get, or like? 172 00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.470 Jenny Duan: How many a word you want to get this year? 173 00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:46.060 huda: maybe like at least 3 to 4 awards this year. I don't know. Like how many, how many do you? Usually they accept in when you're applying 174 00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.190 huda: maybe I could work on the fifth one during some minute. But yeah. 175 00:22:51.430 --> 00:23:00.590 Jenny Duan: cool sounds good. And then for personal goals. Do you have any like personal goals that you want to work towards? This is just like time management, like. 176 00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:05.839 Jenny Duan: I don't know making friends. Anything like personal like that that you want to work on. 177 00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:18.200 huda: Yeah, I definitely want to make more friends this year. I want to get better at time management, and like keeping track of how long I'm doing things 178 00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:24.800 huda: and trying to like keep like a solid schedule throughout the day like we built 179 00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.900 huda: And I think I just I wanna like 180 00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:35.519 huda: I don't know if this is like too personal that I like. I work out every day. Awesome. 181 00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:44.829 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then how? How is the like lower social media going? Have you been following that, or has that been difficult? 182 00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.039 huda: I during the weekends for the 183 00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:57.559 huda: the parts and the schedule, which I couldn't do, I kind of took a break and I had on my phone. 184 00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:20.309 huda: But once, like Sunday school actually starts like August like, next weekend. So once that starts, then I'll actually have things to do. Yeah, okay, how about when you have nothing to do? And you want to go on your phone. How about you do your workout? Then? Yeah, I can still squeeze in like that exercise time. But still like 185 00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.729 Jenny Duan: doing something kind of productive. Yeah. 186 00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:35.140 Jenny Duan: yeah, that's good to you. Okay, awesome. So let's talk about your plan for next week. And what are the what your concrete tangible goals for next week are in terms of your extracurriculars and everything else. 187 00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.540 Jenny Duan: So 188 00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:51.439 Jenny Duan: I think it would be good to like. Set some structure into your how we're going to make progress on all the passion projects that we talked about. So how we talked about the the video project, your Youtube and your game. 189 00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.740 Jenny Duan: So 190 00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.139 Jenny Duan: what do you? What concretely do you want to achieve during next week? 191 00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.610 huda: so I want to make 192 00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:21.820 huda: at least film and a post one video on Youtube that we use. What? What? What type of video is that gonna be. it's probably going to be the one about like the my like tips on setting for the Ap hug. Exam. 193 00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.070 Jenny Duan: okay. 194 00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.400 huda: yeah. And how are you going to do that? Do you have a camera? 195 00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.159 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then, do you have editing tools already? Okay, do you have a Youtube account? 196 00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840 huda: Yeah. 197 00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.850 Jenny Duan: okay, do you have it like, do you have a Youtube channel set up? 198 00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:46.040 huda: Yeah. So I uploaded like one of my video old video projects on there. So I think I'll just post on that channel. 199 00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:51.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. And I'm I'm breaking down all these steps with you, just to make sure, like. 200 00:25:51.850 --> 00:26:13.249 Jenny Duan: like you have everything in line, because sometimes it's easy to just be like for me. I always cycles where I'm like, oh, I need to do this. But then I realized to do one thing, you know, it takes like 10 other steps. So I'm just breaking it down to make sure that, like we're good to go every step of the way. Okay, cool. And then for your video project, what? What do you think would be a good progress check for next week? 201 00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:22.309 huda: Okay, I could solidify a name for the project. and start developing the website for it 202 00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:33.660 huda: and maybe I can start like drafting an an email or like a message to one of the small businesses. 203 00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.530 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 204 00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:46.660 Jenny Duan: so to when you say, like, start developing the website, what do you want to have done for the website for next week. 205 00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:56.630 huda: I think just I have. I have like a first thing I'll do is I'll design, like the website on figma, just to see how I want it. 206 00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:15.149 Jenny Duan: but I think that's a good. I think that's enough for a week. That's a big task like designing an entire website on figure that's not. That's not something that takes a short amount of time like that takes a long time. So I think that's a that's good. And then, okay for your game. How? What progress you want to make for your game? 207 00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:28.129 huda: I want to complete at least like. So you know how to share the different AI models. So I think I want to finish the classification model this week. 208 00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:33.360 huda: and maybe start planning out like the different ones. 209 00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.449 huda: and the different many games. 210 00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 211 00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:45.020 Jenny Duan: So okay, the other thing I I need you to do is like, send Jenny your complete list of activities. 212 00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:58.620 Jenny Duan: Okay? And I want to take a look at that and like, give you some feedback on some things. I think you should put more time into, and some things I think you should put less time into like. I don't know you were doing speech and debate, but I think that's one thing that you can put 213 00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:15.630 Jenny Duan: less time into since we decided that you weren't that interested in it. But, for example, other things like the U.S.A. Code. Maybe you'll put more time into it because it aligns with the rest of your application, and it's something that you're excited to do. So. I think if you could send me like that complete list that would be great. And then 214 00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:22.580 Jenny Duan: yeah, just this list of tasks. Does that look feasible for you for the next week. Yeah, for sure. 215 00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.409 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So then I will check back in with you. 216 00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.570 Jenny Duan: Is it actually tomorrow, either tomorrow or the day after that to do 217 00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:39.740 Jenny Duan: this is just our check in. So in a couple of days we'll do like the targeted session. But then, next week, when we have the check in. I want to check in with you and just 218 00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.819 Jenny Duan: see how everything is going on this front. and that sounds good to you. 219 00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:59.440 Jenny Duan: Okay? Awesome. During your last couple of minutes I was actually wondering if I can see your game. So gonna be possible for you to like, share your screen, or I don't know what's easiest like. If you have a link to demo whatever is easiest for you. 220 00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:05.899 huda: sure let me just open it up real quick. It takes some time. So oh, yeah, no problem. 221 00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.570 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, thanks a lot, Jenny. Actually, I think a couple of things I I was in and out. But 222 00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.490 Ivy Mentors: great! I think that tactical breakdown is critically important. 223 00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:25.739 Ivy Mentors: And so I was just wondering how Kuda are you kind of updating these statuses like, status of the document, are you following that? I mean, just curious. 224 00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.320 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. 225 00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:44.729 huda: yeah, yeah. I'm updating like her on the progress that I've made. And yeah, you're using the same document right? Like the one that and the there's a there's a tracker. And then there's a document correct. 226 00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.290 Ivy Mentors: cool. Yeah, I think this is good. I mean, I was asking you to die yesterday 227 00:29:49.390 --> 00:30:06.130 Ivy Mentors: in the morning, like you know what what's up with your sad, and she's like, Hey, hey? Didn't you know? Like my schedule like, you know, this is my Passion Project time. You know. I'm supposed to like spend like 4 h. So that was like music to my ears. I'm I'm perfectly fine fine with that. but that's great. I one thing on sad, though I I feel like 228 00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.359 Ivy Mentors: this kind of a mental barrier. 229 00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:28.010 Ivy Mentors: and you know it's she hasn't taken it as yet right. She's just started, and it's just that. Oh, yeah, 1550, 1580. What like, you know, there's some kind of a kind of a thing. I mean, she I I'm sure that with with practice like anyone can crack. You know, these are like exams. Right? So that's something that I would. definitely. 230 00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.629 Ivy Mentors: you know. get some advice and help from you on for the 231 00:30:32.720 --> 00:31:01.030 Ivy Mentors: and and if if needed, then probably you know she needs a specialized like. I mean, you told me the other day, right? You know, this doesn't like real need to have like a tutor, and I'll tell you like one other place where I spend like $4,000 for my older daughter as well, and just to only realize that you know the exam actually was optional, or it became blind, you know. So I spent early, and by the time she came to college application it, it was not even necessary anymore for her college, so she didn't even end up applying, like, you know, taking exam, like to be honest. 232 00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:09.890 huda: Right? So that's one of things. Yeah. So work on on that as well with that. Yeah, sorry. Is it? Is it uploaded to that? Go ahead. 233 00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.090 huda: Can you see my screen? 234 00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can see your screen. Wow, that's so cool. 235 00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:29.839 huda: Yeah. Also, I was thinking, I like my or for the game. but that's just like something that I'm gonna work on if I have the time. And then the robot comes. 236 00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.930 huda: it releases a cat. 237 00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:40.590 huda: and then it's supposed to cut away to here where it teaches you like the classification model. 238 00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.930 huda: okay? 239 00:31:47.150 --> 00:32:06.230 huda: And then it's just like sort it. And then, I'm gonna have, like the character have like a dialogue and say, Oh, this is similar to a classification model where it sorts it based off of the different kinds of data. And yeah, that's like, kind of where I'm going with it. That is so cool. 240 00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:15.729 huda: Thank you. yeah. So I'm trying to make this a little more like clean. And then I can move on to the next section 241 00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.200 Jenny Duan: that is so awesome. But I love it. 242 00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.270 huda: Thank you. 243 00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:33.559 Jenny Duan: Yeah, wow. okay. And then the other thing that I just want to show you really, briefly is, if you could go to the opportunities tracker I see you're on it right now. I just made another sheet that says she's 6. 244 00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:49.930 Jenny Duan: And I just wrote you like an sat study schedule. So are you, are you there? He's here. Yeah. Okay. so this is like a pretty intense prep. Schedule that I usually send people if they're like. 245 00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.510 Jenny Duan: so 246 00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.400 Jenny Duan: How it works is like 247 00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:04.340 Jenny Duan: every Monday and Wednesday. You do like the reading, writing sections, and then Tuesday, Thursday, you do like math, no calculator and calculator sections. And then 248 00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:20.459 Jenny Duan: on Saturday you do the full test, and on Sunday you do a test review. This is a really intense prep plan. So it takes a lot of time. So if we want to do a prep plan like this, I just want to give this to you. You can adapt it for your own 249 00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:44.279 Jenny Duan: purposes. I don't necessarily think you need to be doing like a reading, writing test every single day, or rewriting or math calculator. But if you want a very intense prep schedule, this is something that you can work off. Of another thing, the thing I think is most important is doing the practices. Every single weekend those are available just for free on the on the sat like college board website. So there's that. And then for the other tests. 250 00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:59.180 Jenny Duan: if you actually decide to do them very intensely, let me know. And I can send you like the the tests to do so. That's why I say, like March 22, October 2022. Those are like real tests that I have copies of. So if you want that, let me know. 251 00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.350 Jenny Duan: We can assess whether or not this is a good plan for you, but 252 00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:10.150 Jenny Duan: give us some thought over the weekend, and if you want to fit this into your schedule, we can make adoptions to your schedule to fit like an intense 253 00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.780 Jenny Duan: cram sat scheduled. But this is like a again. It's a very intense like, prep schedule. So 254 00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.790 Jenny Duan: think about that, and we'll talk in a couple of days. 255 00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:28.929 huda: Yeah, I'm honestly like, I think this would be really beneficial, because I know, like taking the practice. This is going to be 256 00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.320 huda: very like, it's gonna help me. 257 00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:37.790 huda: So yeah, I could, I could definitely do this. weekly. Yeah. 258 00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:49.770 Jenny Duan: okay, it's it is. So if you want to integrate this, it's gonna be about 2 h every single day into your schedule. Is that okay with you? If that's okay, we can adjust your current schedule to to accommodate 259 00:34:50.350 --> 00:35:01.710 huda: yeah. Cause like, I'm not. I'm thinking that like some days of the week, I won't have to work on clubs, so I could probably create. Then. 260 00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:13.299 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. And then I know we have to wrap up pretty soon. But for your homework has that 2 h been enough? Have you been able to do homework at school, or is that? How's that timing going for that? 261 00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.840 huda: so far? Only have like one piece of homework? 262 00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.439 huda: this week? But 263 00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:24.920 huda: yeah, I think it might be difficult later on. But for now it's it's working. Yeah. 264 00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:47.149 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Then we'll keep on checking in later on to see if that's working, and we'll adjust your schedule as needed. Cool sounds good. Is there anything else you need from me before we check in in a couple of days. yeah. So I was, I was just gonna ask do you have any like apps or methods that I can use like time myself, so I can keep on schedule because I get distracted like pretty easily. 265 00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.360 huda: So I just wanted something to like, yeah. 266 00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.450 Jenny Duan: Oh, so 267 00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.830 Jenny Duan: I know there's some like some really cute and aesthetic ones. The one that I use 268 00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.960 Jenny Duan: is called I don't even know what it's called 269 00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.980 Jenny Duan: 1 s 270 00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:25.419 Jenny Duan: it's called toggle track, but I honestly wouldn't recommend that, because I think it's like it's. I don't think it's good for keeping you. It's constantly, I think toggle is like pretty 271 00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:42.369 Jenny Duan: it on. I I don't think I'd recommend it, because not very. You like user friendly. It's more just like I use it for myself, but I would recommend it to other people. So let me do some research on that, and I'll get back to you sometimes today with some some better apps to use. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. 272 00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:52.369 Jenny Duan: Cool. So I think we can wrap it for now, if you need anything again, just feel free to send me a message, and I'll just I'll be checking it in a couple of days, anyways, so 273 00:36:52.470 --> 00:37:04.740 Ivy Mentors: awesome. So the schedule, I I mean also to kind of bring some consistency to it. Right? So we're gonna do Tuesday, asking both of your 2 days and Saturdays or Sundays. 274 00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:15.840 Jenny Duan: I mean which one what works for you, Jenny? First? Oh, I mean, it's Tuesdays and Saturdays, Tuesday and Sundays. They I don't have a preference Saturday or Sunday. So whatever is easiest for her does fine. 275 00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:24.459 Jenny Duan: I think it's a Saturday, because I don't know if that's because that gives us like a little a couple more days in between our Tuesday and Saturday check in. 276 00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.660 Jenny Duan: So she can do some stuff between those 3 days. 277 00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.810 huda: Yeah, I agree. 278 00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:46.800 huda: Awesome. So 5, 30 to 6 30 on Tuesday, and then 5 30 to 6 on Saturdays. Correct. Yup also. Jenny, can you give her a link to the doc. I'm not sure. I got any share notifications. Oh, yeah. 279 00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:52.560 Jenny Duan: there you go. Alright. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. 280 00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.510 Ivy Mentors: Thank you. 281 00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:01.040 Jenny Duan: I'll I'll I'll I'll correct on the other one.",

But the the video is anyways being. 9 00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:57.579 Ivy Mentors: I think you need to set up some, you know. Ask Jenny about some timer technique, right? Like alerts. 10 00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.059 Ivy Mentors: things like that. I think it's important to have some tracking tools or some 11 00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.180 Ivy Mentors: right. 12 00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.759 Ivy Mentors: especially when you're kind of zoned like, you know.

Hello. 14 00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.960 Ivy Mentors: Hi, Jenny, how are you? 15 00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:41.199 Ivy Mentors: I'm doing? Well, it's good to see you. Yeah. Same here. I know that you're more excited to see who that I'm gonna leave. I I I'm gonna come back in half an hour, but apologies for yesterday, you know, it was terrible. But I think the Internet is back today. It's really good. 16 00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 17 00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.580 Ivy Mentors: cool. okay, I'll I'll leave. And I'll let you guys see, I'm so excited. 18 00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.550 Jenny Duan: Awesome. All right, Huda. Hi! How's it going? 19 00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.360 huda: I'm good. How are you? 20 00:02:53.670 -",
    "-> 00:02:57.630 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. How is your first week of school? 21 00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:07.380 huda: Oh, sorry I forgot to message you. But yeah, I was good. I learned that I had the same teacher that I had last year. So 22 00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:16.029 huda: yeah, and that was good. And I think, yeah, I was going well, and I also secure my spot as like anchor for the 23 00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.049 huda: news again. So because it changes every year. So 24 00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.090 huda: yeah. 25 00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.010 Jenny Duan: same teacher, for what subject? But for Cs awesome. 26 00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.019 Jenny Duan: And are you taking a different Cs class this this year than you were last year. It's an Ap. Course. 27 00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.079 Jenny Duan: Oh, got you awesome 28 00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:48.199 Jenny Duan: And how did everything else go? How we like you for staff classes! Did you get to talk to your teachers. and how are the how is like the beginning of clubs? 29 00:03:48.810 --> 00:04:14.059 huda: Yeah. So for the clubs we figured out for Vfx. Hu. We figured out like who are going to be the rest of the offices, or at least we need 3 to start up a club. So we decided who the vice president and secretary are. And then I emailed the advisor about our our article show. Intelligent ethics. club. So yeah. 30 00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.999 huda: and I'm sure she'll say yes, because we, as we told her that 31 00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.489 huda: it won't be much of a time commitment, because it's just going to be during school. So 32 00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:33.189 Jenny Duan: yeah, awesome. Yeah. And then, how has the schedule been going? Has it been working? Has has it not been working? what are your thoughts on how that went. 33 00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:45.600 huda: Yeah, so I I track sticking to it as much as I can. But there are some things that I just couldn't work on this time this week like the video project since I d",
    "on't really have 34 00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.689 huda: much to do. But I think I can start like reaching out to the small businesses instead of 35 00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:59.929 huda: but there is definitely for the game. At least I've been consistently working on it every day, for like at least 2 and a half hours or 3 h. 36 00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:12.590 huda: And the SSD, I've been doing the Khan Academy practice and I did the reading and writing test for the sat. But I didn't get to finish the whole thing, because 37 00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.599 huda: we unexpectedly like went somewhere. So yeah. 38 00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.839 Jenny Duan: gotcha, yeah, no problem. How's your sat going? By the way, do you have any idea about like what your score is at the moment? 39 00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.479 huda: Yeah. So right now, I have a third 1,360 40 00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.649 huda: but I think I'm I'm working on improving it, because the first time I took it I got like a 41 00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.200 huda: 1,000 42 00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:55.860 huda: I think it was like 1,150, and then The next time I took it was at 1,260, and this time is 1,367. And I see, like, consistent, like improvements. So yeah. 43 00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.900 Jenny Duan: that's awesome. And when are you taking it again? 44 00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.799 huda: October seventh? 45 00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.470 Jenny Duan: Okay, so in 2 months from now, okay. 46 00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:12.870 Jenny Duan: I think so, for the sat. I think now it might be a good time to like. Start really doubling down on your prep. Work for that, just because 47 00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:24.289 Jenny Duan: you're going to take the psat soon in the sat, and on the sat you. You need to get above a 1,550 so your goal should be to get like a 1550, or above 48 00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.590 Jenny Duan: and for the Psat, I think, for eligibility in your State 49 00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.520 Jenny Duan: you'll probably",
    " need to get a 1,500 or above out of 1520 50 00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:44.020 Jenny Duan: on the so those are some goals to work towards over the next 2 months for the Sat and PC team. 51 00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:56.830 Jenny Duan: But just so, that's like on your radar. That is like, pretty important. yeah. And then, were you able to talk to your Student Council about the Youth Action Committee thing. 52 00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:10.839 huda: Actually, I did not get to reach out to them. because I think I should probably follow up. But I did message the the advisor. And she didn't get back to me, I should probably follow up. 53 00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.930 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, no problem. And then, did you schedule a meeting with your counselor in the first week. 54 00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.390 huda: no, not yet. 55 00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.620 Jenny Duan: Okay. Why don't we make a note to do that? 56 00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:39.100 Jenny Duan: Just because that's going to be pretty important? just because your counselor also. One thing that people don't tell you about school is that your counselors will also write 57 00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.630 Jenny Duan: like a 58 00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:51.670 Jenny Duan: They have to sense information about the school to your to each college, and they also write like a short note about you to your colleges. So that's pretty important. 59 00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.700 Jenny Duan: and then some other news for this week is just that This is like. 60 00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:20.269 Jenny Duan: I guess, for future notice. But I just thought I would mention it. Harvard is actually changing like their essay formatting. So that's something interesting. we'll talk more about specifically writing college essays later on. But I'm curious to see how this is going to look like with other schools as well given like within the college admissions. Landscape over this past year, like a lot of things have changed and so 61 00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:30.",
    "220 Jenny Duan: I thought it might be interesting to talk about what that means for you. What means for us? So a couple of things like first. they're getting rid of affirmative action. 62 00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.700 Jenny Duan: in California. 63 00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:38.869 Jenny Duan: and well, not just in California, but just within the United States. And are you familiar with what affirmative action is. 64 00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:57.899 Jenny Duan: Okay? So they're getting rid of affirmative action. I'm not sure what this is gonna mean, for like admissions in general, because I think it's it's it's gonna mean that they're gonna look for culture in other places, which I again, I think this is why it's more important for you to write about your background, your religion and your culture. Because 65 00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.720 Jenny Duan: I think, like schools actually really look for that. 66 00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.830 Jenny Duan: And 67 00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.480 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that. That's, I think there's a common misconception that if you're 68 00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:15.639 Jenny Duan: like Asian, it's harder to get into like a good school, even for Cs. But I think that like, regardless of 69 00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:40.160 Jenny Duan: that stereotype or that perception, it's still really important to talk about your culture, because that's something that they look for a lot. So I don't think you should shy away from like talking about your background of like. That's something I wrote a lot of my essays on, and I think that that's something that like could be important for you to mention as well. Another major change again is that the sat and a Ct. And sorry the sat is going virtual, and your S is still going to be in person? Right? Yeah. 70 00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.089 Jenny Duan: okay. But are you familiar? Are you like, have you heard that the sat is going virtual. 71 00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:51.379 huda: Yeah, I actually want to try the di",
    "gital set. but I'm not sure if you can register for it in the us. 72 00:09:52.130 --> 00:10:02.870 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm not sure if it's offered yet. But I think, like, hopefully, you get a good score on this one, and you want we'll have to retake it. But yeah, I'm also curious to see how the sat goes. 73 00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:16.910 Jenny Duan: virtually. And then the other thing is again like college and missions. Their essays are changing a lot so like Harvard's essays are changing, and I'm not sure if any of the other schools on your list essays are going to change in the future. But 74 00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:31.760 Jenny Duan: I think they're they're instead of doing like longer essays. They're bringing it down to like more shorter prompts, like a series of shorter essays kind of like how they use these are instead of like one long essay like common app. And then a couple of 75 00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.119 Jenny Duan: so yeah. anyways, another thing that I wanted to tell you about was 76 00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:45.500 Jenny Duan: Here, I've got down like I'm starting to populate your summer programs list, too. So 77 00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:54.320 Jenny Duan: this is something that I wanted to show you that we can apply for the deadline. The application is not open, but it's gonna be 78 00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:05.950 Jenny Duan: some time in like the winter spring. But this is like an AI scholars program at Carnegie Mellon, and I don't know if if Cmu is on your list. But have you ever thought about going there. 79 00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:12.119 huda: Yeah, for sure, it's a really great like, engineering college. So 80 00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.670 Jenny Duan: yeah, so this is like an 81 00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.290 Jenny Duan: yeah ethics, sort of school. So 82 00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:27.059 Jenny Duan: it's it's about computer science and AI, and you'll apply it 83 00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:43.099 Jenny Duan: it to use. You apply it to a project that uses artificia",
    "l intelligence for the betterment of humanity. And so I think this is really in line with some of the things that we're talking about your focus on, and some of the things that you're interested in. So I'm just gonna put this on your radar. 84 00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that sounds like a really good program. 85 00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.490 huda: I'm definitely 86 00:11:49.780 --> 00:12:03.820 Jenny Duan: yeah. And it's you must be a current junior. So you're gonna be eligible next year, or like this year. But, like next, you know, year for the application, and it's 4 weeks at Cmu, and it's free. 87 00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:16.139 Jenny Duan: So it'll be like a pre-college type of program. But it's like free. So it's that's pretty cool. yeah. So I thought that right now we could. Something that we can work on is 88 00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.589 Jenny Duan: populating like a gold tracker, because I think, like. 89 00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:30.790 Jenny Duan: I think we we have a bunch of, you know, a daily schedule, and we talked to a lot of things. But let's talk about some of setting some goals for the next school year. 90 00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.929 Jenny Duan: what? How do you? How do you feel about that? 91 00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:51.109 huda: Yeah, I could definitely cause since I'm taking the 4 aps this year. I'm like, the teachers have kind of been scaring us. So I could definitely like me plan out like goals for each class. 92 00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:59.950 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely. So just off the bat like before. I talk about some things that I think we should prioritize. What are some goals? 93 00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.090 Jenny Duan: that you have in mind? 94 00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:16.749 Jenny Duan: in terms of like academic. Maybe, like we can do academic. which would be like school extracurricular award. And then like just personal goals, too. 95 00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.129 huda: for academic 96 00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:38.999 hu",
    "da: maybe try not to get a be like all year, because most of the time I've been in for semester. So I'm trying to like keep an A and both semesters for all my classes is that most of the time you have these in both in first semester. 97 00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:47.909 huda: Well, not for all my classes like, I have one B during the first semester, and then all A's and second semester. So I want to keep it like all these throughout. 98 00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.640 Jenny Duan: Okay, great! 99 00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.480 Jenny Duan: What was your be in 100 00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.950 huda: last year? It was for ap human geography. 101 00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.279 Jenny Duan: Did you get any easier freshman here? 102 00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.790 huda: The first semester I had a be an owner's bio. 103 00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:10.380 Jenny Duan: Okay? Awesome. And then do you have any other academic goals? 104 00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:18.860 huda: I guess. Just build like a stronger bond with my teachers this year? 105 00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.759 huda: like. So they know me better as a student 106 00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.420 huda: in person. 107 00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.570 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. 108 00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.390 Jenny Duan: And then do you have any other academic goals 109 00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.949 Jenny Duan: like? What do you have to go about your sat about psts, about ap testing anything like that? 110 00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.459 huda: Yeah. So I'd say, like, increase my score by like. 111 00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:52.549 huda: 200 points at a minute a month. And just 112 00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.139 huda: practice. Oh, sorry 113 00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:00.360 Jenny Duan: like. What does that mean? Like increase? Do you have a target score in mind. 114 00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.710 huda: I want to get like 1550 or higher 115 00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.280 huda: and definitely, I need to start like practicing more. So yeah. 116 00:15:10.710",
    " --> 00:15:14.110 Jenny Duan: awesome. And then for Psat, do you have a goal? 117 00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.149 huda: like you said, I think, like a 1,500 118 00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.579 Jenny Duan: a good deal 119 00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.340 Jenny Duan: awesome. And then for your Aps, do you have a target for your Ap scores. 120 00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:36.940 huda: I'd want to get a 5 on every class. But I'm finally like for on some. But yeah. 121 00:15:37.960 --> 00:16:01.170 Jenny Duan: okay, amazing. And then the reason why we're writing these goals down is because, like being able to write them down and see them in front of you helps you work towards them better like it's kind of like an active, active manifestation where you're like, I'm writing this down. I'm going to do it. And I like, I'm visualizing it already. So that's why we're writing it down. Just so you can see on paper and know that, like these are the tangible things that we're trying to reach. 122 00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:09.850 Jenny Duan: and then extra credit wise. Do you have any goals? For you know any of the things that we talked about last week, or any of your project that you're working on. 123 00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:28.450 huda: Yeah. So I wanna be more involved with clubs this year, even if I'm just a member like just participating in like all the events just more involved in school clubs in which clubs let's get specific like Msa, speech and debate 124 00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.449 huda: taxpayers. Are you in speech and debate. 125 00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.120 Jenny Duan: What? What type of speech? And it like? What type of speech or debate do you do? 126 00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.280 huda: Oh, I do. original oratory speech! 127 00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.730 Jenny Duan: And how is that going? 128 00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:53.849 huda: Last year it was my first year doing it. So the speeches For one of them I actually ranked like a second 129 00:16:53.930 --> 00:17:04.560 huda: for the li",
    "ke. it was like a regional contest. It wasn't that serious, but because they have like 5 every single year. So yeah, I got second place for one of them. 130 00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:11.050 huda: and yeah, I think I want to continue this year. So are you serious about speech and debate? 131 00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:19.869 Jenny Duan: I did not know that you did this also. Okay, after this, can you send me a list of everything that you're involved in? 132 00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:32.829 huda: Yeah, the reason why I didn't really mention speech and debate is because it's I'm not exactly that interested in it. I want to be more involved so I can get more interested in it. But 133 00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.619 huda: I just feel like my delivery is not great, so I don't think I'd be that great at it. 134 00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, I see. 135 00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:51.420 Jenny Duan: are you so I think we should decide. If you're serious about pursuing speech and debate or not, because I think, if not. then I think 136 00:17:51.580 --> 00:18:18.220 Jenny Duan: you should not do speech and debate and focus your time on other things. But if you're serious about it, I think you should get a speech and debate coach and actually try to win like the politicians and like go hard on speech and debate. But I think that's something we have to decide. Because right now, I think if you're kind of floating through it, I don't think that's a good use of your time, because I think you could be sending that doing other things. But if you're serious about speech and debate, then I want to empower you to like, do that because I think that's really awesome. 137 00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:26.499 huda: Yeah. So I'd say, like, I'm not that interested. So maybe I wouldn't have to get as involved this year. 138 00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.630 huda: yeah. 139 00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.680 Jenny Duan: sounds good. 140 00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:47.130 huda: And also there's a U.S.A. Co. Team a",
    "t my school, and I think I want to get involved in that competition. it's like a it's like a coding competition. Sometimes there'll be like worldwide U.S.A. Co competitions. 141 00:18:47.190 --> 00:19:01.509 Jenny Duan: So, oh, that sounds really, that sounds really awesome. And I think those worldwide U.S.A. code competitions are a really good way to get an international award like place. How easy or difficult is it to place at those competitions! 142 00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.879 huda: It's really hard, because it's like many people know about it. It's 143 00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.060 huda: Well, like one of the more popular clubs. 144 00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:18.649 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's awesome. Well, that sounds like something cool to get involved in. Are you like a competitive programmer at all like, do you do competitive programming? 145 00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:31.809 huda: I've done hackathons and such. But I've never done like I think U.S.A. Co. Is more like a problem solving thing like. It'll give you like a problem. And you have to make a code for it 146 00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.250 huda: rather than in like hackathon, or you just like make a product 147 00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.800 Jenny Duan: right? And are you serious about competitive coding? Which is, I think, what U.S.A. code is? 148 00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:52.370 huda: Yeah, I think like just seeing my potential, like I would like other competing with other programmers is is probably going to be encouraging to me. So yeah. 149 00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:59.259 Jenny Duan: awesome. Then I think that you can train for U.S.A. code and 150 00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:06.690 Jenny Duan: I'll I'll put some resources in our document for U.S.A. code training. But 151 00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.200 let's see. 152 00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:25.760 Jenny Duan: I think, like we code is a good place to start to learn data structures and algorithms. and then for practice, after you finish a bunch of lead codes like, there's",
    " other competitive programming websites that you can check out. 153 00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:33.930 Jenny Duan: But okay, that's something to think about. What else are you trying to get more involved with extracurricular wise. Is there anything else? 154 00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:45.040 huda: maybe just like working on my other passions like. 155 00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:53.340 huda: I don't know, like, specifically, but like definitely working on video projects. and 156 00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:02.450 huda: my video game development, I want to try to get it done before winter, or like, maybe in the middle of winter. 157 00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:12.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. And then for the for the video project, what is the concrete goal you have with the video project? 158 00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.570 huda: go to website, 159 00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.980 huda: and reach out to like at least 160 00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:27.989 huda: 3 other people that are interested in so and if they they could collaborate with me. 161 00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.230 Jenny Duan: yeah, awesome. And so then for the video game. Do you have any plans to like 162 00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.009 Jenny Duan: market that, or share your story with others? And in any way. 163 00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:53.069 huda: yeah, so I'm gonna work on like a dev log. while I'm making it, and try to post on and see if I could get any views on that. And other than that I'll probably like, make social media for it 164 00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.729 huda: and try to like market it on there. 165 00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.570 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how's your Youtube going? Have you thought about that at all. 166 00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.719 huda: Yeah. So I actually had an idea. 167 00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:16.649 huda: cause I know when I took a B hug I really wanted to like, I wash a lot of those videos for, like, how I got a 5 on the Ap hug exam. So I was thinking, like doing a Youtube video on that. So 168 00:22:17.460 -",
    "-> 00:22:19.159 Jenny Duan: awesome. Sounds good. 169 00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah, cool. 170 00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.640 Jenny Duan: And then 171 00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:28.119 Jenny Duan: for your awards, do you have any specific ideas of what awards you want to get, or like? 172 00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.470 Jenny Duan: How many a word you want to get this year? 173 00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:46.060 huda: maybe like at least 3 to 4 awards this year. I don't know. Like how many, how many do you? Usually they accept in when you're applying 174 00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.190 huda: maybe I could work on the fifth one during some minute. But yeah. 175 00:22:51.430 --> 00:23:00.590 Jenny Duan: cool sounds good. And then for personal goals. Do you have any like personal goals that you want to work towards? This is just like time management, like. 176 00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:05.839 Jenny Duan: I don't know making friends. Anything like personal like that that you want to work on. 177 00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:18.200 huda: Yeah, I definitely want to make more friends this year. I want to get better at time management, and like keeping track of how long I'm doing things 178 00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:24.800 huda: and trying to like keep like a solid schedule throughout the day like we built 179 00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.900 huda: And I think I just I wanna like 180 00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:35.519 huda: I don't know if this is like too personal that I like. I work out every day. Awesome. 181 00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:44.829 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then how? How is the like lower social media going? Have you been following that, or has that been difficult? 182 00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.039 huda: I during the weekends for the 183 00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:57.559 huda: the parts and the schedule, which I couldn't do, I kind of took a break and I had on my phone. 184 00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:20.309 huda: But once, like Sunday school actually starts like August like, next weekend. So ",
    "once that starts, then I'll actually have things to do. Yeah, okay, how about when you have nothing to do? And you want to go on your phone. How about you do your workout? Then? Yeah, I can still squeeze in like that exercise time. But still like 185 00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.729 Jenny Duan: doing something kind of productive. Yeah. 186 00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:35.140 Jenny Duan: yeah, that's good to you. Okay, awesome. So let's talk about your plan for next week. And what are the what your concrete tangible goals for next week are in terms of your extracurriculars and everything else. 187 00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.540 Jenny Duan: So 188 00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:51.439 Jenny Duan: I think it would be good to like. Set some structure into your how we're going to make progress on all the passion projects that we talked about. So how we talked about the the video project, your Youtube and your game. 189 00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.740 Jenny Duan: So 190 00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.139 Jenny Duan: what do you? What concretely do you want to achieve during next week? 191 00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.610 huda: so I want to make 192 00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:21.820 huda: at least film and a post one video on Youtube that we use. What? What? What type of video is that gonna be. it's probably going to be the one about like the my like tips on setting for the Ap hug. Exam. 193 00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.070 Jenny Duan: okay. 194 00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.400 huda: yeah. And how are you going to do that? Do you have a camera? 195 00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.159 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then, do you have editing tools already? Okay, do you have a Youtube account? 196 00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840 huda: Yeah. 197 00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.850 Jenny Duan: okay, do you have it like, do you have a Youtube channel set up? 198 00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:46.040 huda: Yeah. So I uploaded like one of my video old video projects on there. So I think I'll just post on that channel. 199 00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:51.",
    "280 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. And I'm I'm breaking down all these steps with you, just to make sure, like. 200 00:25:51.850 --> 00:26:13.249 Jenny Duan: like you have everything in line, because sometimes it's easy to just be like for me. I always cycles where I'm like, oh, I need to do this. But then I realized to do one thing, you know, it takes like 10 other steps. So I'm just breaking it down to make sure that, like we're good to go every step of the way. Okay, cool. And then for your video project, what? What do you think would be a good progress check for next week? 201 00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:22.309 huda: Okay, I could solidify a name for the project. and start developing the website for it 202 00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:33.660 huda: and maybe I can start like drafting an an email or like a message to one of the small businesses. 203 00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.530 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 204 00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:46.660 Jenny Duan: so to when you say, like, start developing the website, what do you want to have done for the website for next week. 205 00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:56.630 huda: I think just I have. I have like a first thing I'll do is I'll design, like the website on figma, just to see how I want it. 206 00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:15.149 Jenny Duan: but I think that's a good. I think that's enough for a week. That's a big task like designing an entire website on figure that's not. That's not something that takes a short amount of time like that takes a long time. So I think that's a that's good. And then, okay for your game. How? What progress you want to make for your game? 207 00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:28.129 huda: I want to complete at least like. So you know how to share the different AI models. So I think I want to finish the classification model this week. 208 00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:33.360 huda: and maybe start planning out like the different ones. 209 00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.449 huda: and the different many games. 210 00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.62",
    "0 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 211 00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:45.020 Jenny Duan: So okay, the other thing I I need you to do is like, send Jenny your complete list of activities. 212 00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:58.620 Jenny Duan: Okay? And I want to take a look at that and like, give you some feedback on some things. I think you should put more time into, and some things I think you should put less time into like. I don't know you were doing speech and debate, but I think that's one thing that you can put 213 00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:15.630 Jenny Duan: less time into since we decided that you weren't that interested in it. But, for example, other things like the U.S.A. Code. Maybe you'll put more time into it because it aligns with the rest of your application, and it's something that you're excited to do. So. I think if you could send me like that complete list that would be great. And then 214 00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:22.580 Jenny Duan: yeah, just this list of tasks. Does that look feasible for you for the next week. Yeah, for sure. 215 00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.409 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So then I will check back in with you. 216 00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.570 Jenny Duan: Is it actually tomorrow, either tomorrow or the day after that to do 217 00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:39.740 Jenny Duan: this is just our check in. So in a couple of days we'll do like the targeted session. But then, next week, when we have the check in. I want to check in with you and just 218 00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.819 Jenny Duan: see how everything is going on this front. and that sounds good to you. 219 00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:59.440 Jenny Duan: Okay? Awesome. During your last couple of minutes I was actually wondering if I can see your game. So gonna be possible for you to like, share your screen, or I don't know what's easiest like. If you have a link to demo whatever is easiest for you. 220 00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:05.899 huda: sure let me just open it up real quick. It takes some time. So oh, yeah, no proble",
    "m. 221 00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.570 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, thanks a lot, Jenny. Actually, I think a couple of things I I was in and out. But 222 00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.490 Ivy Mentors: great! I think that tactical breakdown is critically important. 223 00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:25.739 Ivy Mentors: And so I was just wondering how Kuda are you kind of updating these statuses like, status of the document, are you following that? I mean, just curious. 224 00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.320 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. 225 00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:44.729 huda: yeah, yeah. I'm updating like her on the progress that I've made. And yeah, you're using the same document right? Like the one that and the there's a there's a tracker. And then there's a document correct. 226 00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.290 Ivy Mentors: cool. Yeah, I think this is good. I mean, I was asking you to die yesterday 227 00:29:49.390 --> 00:30:06.130 Ivy Mentors: in the morning, like you know what what's up with your sad, and she's like, Hey, hey? Didn't you know? Like my schedule like, you know, this is my Passion Project time. You know. I'm supposed to like spend like 4 h. So that was like music to my ears. I'm I'm perfectly fine fine with that. but that's great. I one thing on sad, though I I feel like 228 00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.359 Ivy Mentors: this kind of a mental barrier. 229 00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:28.010 Ivy Mentors: and you know it's she hasn't taken it as yet right. She's just started, and it's just that. Oh, yeah, 1550, 1580. What like, you know, there's some kind of a kind of a thing. I mean, she I I'm sure that with with practice like anyone can crack. You know, these are like exams. Right? So that's something that I would. definitely. 230 00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.629 Ivy Mentors: you know. get some advice and help from you on for the 231 00:30:32.720 --> 00:31:01.030 Ivy Mentors: and and if if needed, then probably you know she needs a specialized like. I mean, you told me the other day, right? You know, th",
    "is doesn't like real need to have like a tutor, and I'll tell you like one other place where I spend like $4,000 for my older daughter as well, and just to only realize that you know the exam actually was optional, or it became blind, you know. So I spent early, and by the time she came to college application it, it was not even necessary anymore for her college, so she didn't even end up applying, like, you know, taking exam, like to be honest. 232 00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:09.890 huda: Right? So that's one of things. Yeah. So work on on that as well with that. Yeah, sorry. Is it? Is it uploaded to that? Go ahead. 233 00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.090 huda: Can you see my screen? 234 00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can see your screen. Wow, that's so cool. 235 00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:29.839 huda: Yeah. Also, I was thinking, I like my or for the game. but that's just like something that I'm gonna work on if I have the time. And then the robot comes. 236 00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.930 huda: it releases a cat. 237 00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:40.590 huda: and then it's supposed to cut away to here where it teaches you like the classification model. 238 00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.930 huda: okay? 239 00:31:47.150 --> 00:32:06.230 huda: And then it's just like sort it. And then, I'm gonna have, like the character have like a dialogue and say, Oh, this is similar to a classification model where it sorts it based off of the different kinds of data. And yeah, that's like, kind of where I'm going with it. That is so cool. 240 00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:15.729 huda: Thank you. yeah. So I'm trying to make this a little more like clean. And then I can move on to the next section 241 00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.200 Jenny Duan: that is so awesome. But I love it. 242 00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.270 huda: Thank you. 243 00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:33.559 Jenny Duan: Yeah, wow. okay. And then the other thing that I just want to show you really, briefly is, if you could go to the opportunities ",
    "tracker I see you're on it right now. I just made another sheet that says she's 6. 244 00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:49.930 Jenny Duan: And I just wrote you like an sat study schedule. So are you, are you there? He's here. Yeah. Okay. so this is like a pretty intense prep. Schedule that I usually send people if they're like. 245 00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.510 Jenny Duan: so 246 00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.400 Jenny Duan: How it works is like 247 00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:04.340 Jenny Duan: every Monday and Wednesday. You do like the reading, writing sections, and then Tuesday, Thursday, you do like math, no calculator and calculator sections. And then 248 00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:20.459 Jenny Duan: on Saturday you do the full test, and on Sunday you do a test review. This is a really intense prep plan. So it takes a lot of time. So if we want to do a prep plan like this, I just want to give this to you. You can adapt it for your own 249 00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:44.279 Jenny Duan: purposes. I don't necessarily think you need to be doing like a reading, writing test every single day, or rewriting or math calculator. But if you want a very intense prep schedule, this is something that you can work off. Of another thing, the thing I think is most important is doing the practices. Every single weekend those are available just for free on the on the sat like college board website. So there's that. And then for the other tests. 250 00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:59.180 Jenny Duan: if you actually decide to do them very intensely, let me know. And I can send you like the the tests to do so. That's why I say, like March 22, October 2022. Those are like real tests that I have copies of. So if you want that, let me know. 251 00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.350 Jenny Duan: We can assess whether or not this is a good plan for you, but 252 00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:10.150 Jenny Duan: give us some thought over the weekend, and if you want to fit this into your schedule, we can make adoptions to your schedule to fi",
    "t like an intense 253 00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.780 Jenny Duan: cram sat scheduled. But this is like a again. It's a very intense like, prep schedule. So 254 00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.790 Jenny Duan: think about that, and we'll talk in a couple of days. 255 00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:28.929 huda: Yeah, I'm honestly like, I think this would be really beneficial, because I know, like taking the practice. This is going to be 256 00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.320 huda: very like, it's gonna help me. 257 00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:37.790 huda: So yeah, I could, I could definitely do this. weekly. Yeah. 258 00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:49.770 Jenny Duan: okay, it's it is. So if you want to integrate this, it's gonna be about 2 h every single day into your schedule. Is that okay with you? If that's okay, we can adjust your current schedule to to accommodate 259 00:34:50.350 --> 00:35:01.710 huda: yeah. Cause like, I'm not. I'm thinking that like some days of the week, I won't have to work on clubs, so I could probably create. Then. 260 00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:13.299 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. And then I know we have to wrap up pretty soon. But for your homework has that 2 h been enough? Have you been able to do homework at school, or is that? How's that timing going for that? 261 00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.840 huda: so far? Only have like one piece of homework? 262 00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.439 huda: this week? But 263 00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:24.920 huda: yeah, I think it might be difficult later on. But for now it's it's working. Yeah. 264 00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:47.149 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Then we'll keep on checking in later on to see if that's working, and we'll adjust your schedule as needed. Cool sounds good. Is there anything else you need from me before we check in in a couple of days. yeah. So I was, I was just gonna ask do you have any like apps or methods that I can use like time myself, so I can keep on schedule because I get distracted like pretty easily. 265 00:35:47.180 --> 00",
    ":35:50.360 huda: So I just wanted something to like, yeah. 266 00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.450 Jenny Duan: Oh, so 267 00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.830 Jenny Duan: I know there's some like some really cute and aesthetic ones. The one that I use 268 00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.960 Jenny Duan: is called I don't even know what it's called 269 00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.980 Jenny Duan: 1 s 270 00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:25.419 Jenny Duan: it's called toggle track, but I honestly wouldn't recommend that, because I think it's like it's. I don't think it's good for keeping you. It's constantly, I think toggle is like pretty 271 00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:42.369 Jenny Duan: it on. I I don't think I'd recommend it, because not very. You like user friendly. It's more just like I use it for myself, but I would recommend it to other people. So let me do some research on that, and I'll get back to you sometimes today with some some better apps to use. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. 272 00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:52.369 Jenny Duan: Cool. So I think we can wrap it for now, if you need anything again, just feel free to send me a message, and I'll just I'll be checking it in a couple of days, anyways, so 273 00:36:52.470 --> 00:37:04.740 Ivy Mentors: awesome. So the schedule, I I mean also to kind of bring some consistency to it. Right? So we're gonna do Tuesday, asking both of your 2 days and Saturdays or Sundays. 274 00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:15.840 Jenny Duan: I mean which one what works for you, Jenny? First? Oh, I mean, it's Tuesdays and Saturdays, Tuesday and Sundays. They I don't have a preference Saturday or Sunday. So whatever is easiest for her does fine. 275 00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:24.459 Jenny Duan: I think it's a Saturday, because I don't know if that's because that gives us like a little a couple more days in between our Tuesday and Saturday check in. 276 00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.660 Jenny Duan: So she can do some stuff between those 3 days. 277 00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.810 huda: Yeah, I agree",
    ". 278 00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:46.800 huda: Awesome. So 5, 30 to 6 30 on Tuesday, and then 5 30 to 6 on Saturdays. Correct. Yup also. Jenny, can you give her a link to the doc. I'm not sure. I got any share notifications. Oh, yeah. 279 00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:52.560 Jenny Duan: there you go. Alright. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. 280 00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.510 Ivy Mentors: Thank you. 281 00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:01.040 Jenny Duan: I'll I'll I'll I'll correct on the other one."

You need to get above a 1,550 so your goal should be to get like a 1550, or above 48 and for the Psat, I think, for eligibility in your State 49 you'll probably need to get a 1,500 or above out of 1520 50 on the so those are some goals to work towards over the next 2 months for the Sat and PC team. 51 But just so, that's like on your radar.

Because 65 I think, like schools actually really look for that. 66 And 67 yeah, I think that.
