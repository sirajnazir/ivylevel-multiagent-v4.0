Long time is here? 2 00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.439 huda siraj: Oh, yeah, it has been a while. I'm doing really. Well, how about you? 3 00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.650 Jenny Duan: Let's just go through. yeah, let's just go through current updates like life updates in general. 4 00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:21.700 huda siraj: how's everything? So I just recovered from my cold. So it's kind of bad. But yeah, I don't know what's going on. But like, I feel like everyone's been getting sick lately. But yeah, I think I'm feeling a lot better now. But yeah, I did have to like not go to school for some time. But yeah, anyway. I think in general, I think 5 00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:37.449 huda siraj: everything's kind of normal. It's nothing's really happening. We do have like like a we have a sharkting project. Which I was telling you about it's kind of like a really big project in English. And we have like the presentations happening now. And it's kind of grand cause. 6 00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.410 huda siraj: We have like judges like 7 00:01:39.560 --> 00:02:00.590 huda siraj: from outside of school coming. And it's pretty cool. Yeah. what is your project? Again? We like made kind of like, a thing to counteract social media like addiction. So we have, like like games like fun games that are like also educational 8 00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:16.449 huda siraj: and like our teachers, gonna be like the one of the characters in it. So yeah. And then we have like puzzles, and which are like customized like child's interests. To like combat that. And then there's like reach out to people who are like experts in the field and stuff. 9 00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.239 huda siraj: And I was able to connect with like a really really like accomplished author about social media usage. That's pretty cool. 10 00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.820 Jenny Duan: super cool, 11 00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.179 Jenny Duan: social media that's super awesome. And when is the project again. Like, when are you presenting? 12 00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:45.850 huda siraj: We're presenting next week. But like, most of the groups are doing this week. But yeah, like, it's like due this Friday. But yeah. 13 00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.799 Jenny Duan: good luck. And and I thank you. Great. 14 00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.240 huda siraj: thank you. 15 00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.490 Jenny Duan: And how is your a push test? 16 00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:04.469 huda siraj: The a push test. It went mediocre. I got a V, so then I I'm going to retake it to try and get a 90 tomorrow. 17 00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.940 huda siraj: So yeah. 18 00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.449 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Good luck. How are you feeling about that? 19 00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:24.970 huda siraj: I'm feeling like, I think I need to do corrections first. Actually. So like, I'm not actually gonna take it tomorrow. But like, I feel like this score was kind of confusing cause. I thought I did. Well, but 20 00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.929 huda siraj: I guess it was kind of hard. 21 00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.210 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think sometimes that happens. And that's okay, too. 22 00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.300 Jenny Duan: How is some empowering AI going? Are you were able to restart the boot camp. 23 00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.530 huda siraj: Yeah. So we had like. 4 to 5. 24 00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:51.989 huda siraj: We had 4 to 5 people like, show up on the day of the first boot camp. Yeah. 25 00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:15.719 huda siraj: yeah. So we got like a few people that join. And II think it went pretty well cause like we had lots of questions that they were like asking. And then we had them like practice, like many projects on their own. And in the end, I think I think the kids really liked it because we did this like really fun. Ca, who like it, was like in the style like our shark is chasing you. And then you have to answer all these questions. 26 00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:28.510 huda siraj: And then, like, I think they really like that. And we did also get like a screen recording. So we're gonna start, like, you know, like publicizing that and and all that. So yeah, I think it went really well for the first week. 27 00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.440 huda siraj: Awesome. And this is the second one happening this weekend 28 00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.669 Jenny Duan: cool? That's totally awesome and super great that before actually coming to that 29 00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.540 Jenny Duan: and 30 00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.710 Jenny Duan: or full flipped. How is that going? Do you have an update? 31 00:04:43.770 --> 00:05:09.299 huda siraj: Yeah. So we did get like someone from brown interested in like writing for us. But but then they like? Asked like, how much do we pay? So they're kind of replying this like a voluntary service. So we're kind of like a nonprofit. And we're just trying to spread the message. So they haven't really like updated us after that. So I think we might have lost them. But I think 32 00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:23.129 huda siraj: I'll probably start like just writing articles on my own, because at this point, because I mean like, although like, it's nice to have like people will do it. I think it's nice to have like a lot of content. So I think I might write some more articles for folklift. 33 00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:42.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah, why don't you try to amplify your work with existing organizations like start and dealing people on Instagram, and ask if they can like share publicized folklore, for example like this is an opportunity for people to send if they work to prepare like anthology, or something like that, and reach out to the like. Like Stanford, sit in, like 34 00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.659 Jenny Duan: all the like college organizations, reach out to their instagrams like pretty much every college campus has, like 35 00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.359 Jenny Duan: a presence in this space, or like a student advocacy group. And I'm sure that, like. 36 00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:01.930 Jenny Duan: they would probably be able to amplify your work if you reached out to them. So maybe email them, or like, damn them on Instagram from your folklift account, and like 37 00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.460 Jenny Duan: be, if they would want to like, just re share one of your posts, or like, submit or share, like a call to action for you. 38 00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.990 huda siraj: Okay, yeah, that's that's a really great idea. I think I'll do that after this call 39 00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:26.520 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Let me know if you need help, like finding organizations. But I think if you just search one organization like starting with Stanford or any other school. Then just look through their followers. You can probably find. 40 00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:53.220 Jenny Duan: I think, like the biggest thing that you should be thinking about with all your projects is just how to publicize them the most. Because I feel like you have really great work and really great initiatives. You just need more people to see it so like amplify your impact. So I think it's such a struggle. But I think that's something that you should be focused on the most right now. Filmmakers club. And how is that going? So I know you've finished editing the trailer. Are you done editing the actual film itself? 41 00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.009 huda siraj: No, not yet. But we are having a meeting. This 42 00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:26.840 huda siraj: Thursday like physically, so that we can like I think I mentioned this last time, but doing like a competition to see like which trailers the best. And then we're gonna put down like soon ease and everything. And yeah, I think for the actual film being edited. I think we're gonna have to first choose a trailer. So that way we can have, like that person. Whoever made the trailer kind of like, take a lead for the actual editing. 43 00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.920 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and then 44 00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.920 Jenny Duan: with the game. Are you making progress on publicizing it. Or like, I know that you're in contact with a lot of podcasts, how's that going 45 00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.490 huda siraj: yeah so for one of the podcasts, 46 00:07:42.550 --> 00:08:01.069 huda siraj: we're gonna be filming in April. The other one. I'm actually not sure if if the podcast episode is out yet. But I think they're like mentioning like some Thoria and one of their podcast make sure I find it. 47 00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.959 huda siraj: but yeah. And then I think so. Like publicize it more. 48 00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:14.600 huda siraj: I could probably start like being more active on Linkedin. But yeah. 49 00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:31.320 Jenny Duan: sounds good. I think also. I think now I before we go to your essays. I want to just do like sort of a step back and look at just how your extra curricular and everything is going in general, because I think you still have 50 00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:40.089 Jenny Duan: an opportunity to bulk up your extracurriculars a little bit more, just to ensure that we hit that like 10 extracurricular count before the application cycle starts 51 00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:49.280 Jenny Duan: in. August. So right now, just to recap that, I sure feel like that. I'm like seeing better than most prominent, for you are 52 00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.530 Jenny Duan: empowering a I folklift the Filmmakers club 53 00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.060 Jenny Duan: your game 54 00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:02.200 huda siraj: and how's the the mosque? Wondering. Is that still going? Well. 55 00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.750 huda siraj: can you tell me like 56 00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:17.590 huda siraj: next year? I think I'm gonna try to ask if I can become like the teacher cause once you're like in senior year. I think you're allowed to be a teacher, so I can probably step up from there. 57 00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.750 Jenny Duan: That sounds good. 58 00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.750 Jenny Duan: And 59 00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:31.220 Jenny Duan: what else? So apparently 60 00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:43.399 Jenny Duan: And can you remind me, are you? Are you on like a what's it called Regional Leadership Council? Because I remember you mentioning this a few times, but want to confirm. 61 00:09:43.710 --> 00:10:13.450 huda siraj: I'm like a member of the Youth Action Committee. It's just like a local like kind of Youth Action Committee. But I'm just like a member of attended like 2 meetings. But yeah, I remember that you're gonna ask them to to have the zoom link to attend more. How's that? Oh, yeah, I completely forgot about like reaching out to the lady. But I think, yeah, actually send it right now. So that don't forget. 62 00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:23.249 Jenny Duan: How's the like? Is golden games on the table like, how is that situation going? They haven't gotten back to me at all about 63 00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.029 huda siraj: about that. And then they said, they're still reviewing it. So 64 00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.099 Jenny Duan: okay, no worries, I'd say, then that's fine. Just let that be 65 00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.509 Jenny Duan: I think summer program is going to be one thing. 66 00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:48.489 Jenny Duan: so right now we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, completing the summer at the future summer program. Are you for many are you on in honor societies? 67 00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.840 huda siraj: No, I'm not 68 00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.930 Jenny Duan: okay. 69 00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:09.310 huda siraj: Are you planning to join any honor society, I think, for for our schools like a club. Right? So I think in the beginning of the year we're supposed like, apply. And then we like need, like a teacher's recommendation. And like like. 70 00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.919 huda siraj: it's kind of like a application to a summer program. Basically. 71 00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.040 Jenny Duan: okay, gotcha. 72 00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:27.970 Jenny Duan: okay. So I think if we have room for 3 more extracurriculars. So I would say that maybe what something you can add is more like leadership within an existing 73 00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.589 Jenny Duan: organization, or something that because I feel like you have a lot of self directed leadership. 74 00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.840 Jenny Duan: I would like to see like some more leadership through organization. 75 00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:47.969 Jenny Duan: So I think like by by our next session. I'm gonna do a little bit of research into like specific programs that you can do for like specific committees. You can join. There's something like this committee, but like 76 00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.479 Jenny Duan: on at a different organization that I think could be a good fit. 77 00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.240 Jenny Duan: So I will just research on that. And then, if there's anything that you can think of on that front, that would be 78 00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:14.159 huda siraj: oh, yeah, on Linkedin. I connected with Nicholas from encode justice and I just like connected with them, and I introduced myself. And then I'm like kind of working my way into asking him if, like he if like. 79 00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:21.029 huda siraj: I could work for like the labor section for for, like the board of 80 00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:33.219 Jenny Duan: directly, I think this is like a very low barrier, high impact thing to to be involved in. And you just say I'm interested in joining the advisory. 81 00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.079 Jenny Duan: counsel, I think and say, like you have experience, you know, running in power in a, I like 82 00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:43.799 Jenny Duan: building your game definitely share that cause. I think that's impactful. So yeah, I think 83 00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:55.929 Jenny Duan: I remember, we did talk about this last time. I do think that that is a good thing to have in your profile as well joining, because in Co. Justice is like a very impactful large organization. And if you connect, can connect with Sneeha actually 84 00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.519 Jenny Duan: ask Nicholas to introduce. you can hold message, Neha, if she doesn't respond to ask 85 00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:26.840 Jenny Duan: Nicholas if you can't connect with Sneha, I can connect you directly with her cause. I know her but I think Stay has, like a good mentor to have as well, because she is super involved in AI ethics obviously as well. She's like spoken, you know, at dog host like world economic Forum, like basically traveled all over the world to like, speak about this issue. So think, having her as a network person. She can also bring you a lot of opportunities. 86 00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.800 Jenny Duan: so yeah, hopefully, if we can get that position, then we still have 2 more spots. 87 00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:37.080 Jenny Duan: that I would love to fill with other things. 88 00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:46.549 Jenny Duan: so yeah, let me do some more research into that and get back to you. I think, having something that has to do with like gaming could be impactful. 89 00:13:46.650 --> 00:14:14.639 huda siraj: Try again and like, really try to reach out for women and games like I could probably like, just like DM, one of the moderators, maybe, and just kind of like talk to them, and then like, ask like, kind of establish, like, I think they mentioned that they really want, like a an ambassador who like talk about like teach like game development. But yeah, like, I think I'll try and express that when I'm talking to them. 90 00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.129 huda siraj: Yeah, I'll try like a little bit harder for that. 91 00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.559 Jenny Duan: Oh, very cool. And how is your own discord? Community going? 92 00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:34.549 huda siraj: Oh, I don't. I don't think that's like a thing anymore, like we have like like 3 members. And then I asked him to invite anyone, and they're just gonna I don't know any other game developers. So 93 00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.310 huda siraj: it's just not really working that. Well. 94 00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.900 okay. 95 00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.669 Jenny Duan: no worries. 96 00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.739 Jenny Duan: Okay. Then, I think 97 00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.989 Jenny Duan: this is still something. Yeah, 2 more things you can fill. I think 98 00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:53.160 Jenny Duan: I think that's something related to gaming would be good. And then. Vivian. 99 00:14:53.470 --> 00:15:03.379 Jenny Duan: if I can think about any other like general interest programs to put you into. I think that would be good, too. But let me think about this some more this week. One. 100 00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 101 00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.320 Jenny Duan: cool. 102 00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:22.430 Jenny Duan: I think, depending on how this summer goes. We'll see it when we hear when we start hearing back in March, right about your programs that the case? Yeah, like late March. 103 00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.100 Jenny Duan: late March. Okay? 104 00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:31.159 Jenny Duan: I think, depending on what you end up choosing to do if you don't 105 00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:39.200 Jenny Duan: end up choosing to do a I research, I think, or any type of like tech research. I think it could be good to start over the summer with some like 106 00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.529 Jenny Duan: research initiatives as well. 107 00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:47.140 Jenny Duan: adding something to like something else like technical stemming could be good. 108 00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.919 Jenny Duan: But I think that'll just depend on what program you ultimately end up choosing. But 109 00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.570 Jenny Duan: I think we can go into that later on. I think. Hat club. 110 00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:01.680 Jenny Duan: Oh, gosh! I wish you could have gone to the Hat Club hackathon. 111 00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:07.009 Jenny Duan: I think you would have. Really, I think you would have really liked it. But there's gonna be more so that's all, said fine. 112 00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:14.770 Jenny Duan: And I think, having hackathons as as something that you participate in more could also be like an extracurricular item. 113 00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:22.809 Jenny Duan: So maybe like we could do a search for more hagathons in your area, too, like that wouldn't require travelling. 114 00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:36.670 huda siraj: That could be a good fit for you, too. Also, I had a question so like I wanted to like kind of publicize. The Nc. Where award a little bit, and like especially 115 00:16:36.670 --> 00:17:02.969 huda siraj: like my dad was talking to me, and we kind of wanted to like have it like, have like, maybe like articles, or like I don't know. Get mentioned on like the parent newsletter cause, I know, like a few students like they want like some robotics thing. And they got kind of like mentioned a parent newsletter and I was just like hoping like, maybe you could do the same thing for Nc, with like, maybe like an email. 116 00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:15.130 Ivylevel: I can chime in right. I think, thanks to that for using a kind word. I mean, I've been a bit pushy on that. The reason is this right Jenni. I don't know if I told you before, like as I was looking about and see where 117 00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:31.909 Ivylevel: you know, some of the private schools. Actually, even like we're making a news release about it. Right? And I'm talking about like, Hey, 5 students from our school actually got an honorable mention this year. Kind of a thing, you know, because it's actually good for a school's profile. 118 00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:41.110 Ivylevel: Also that woman empowerment angle and also actually gives an opportunity for HUD to come in the radar with her principal right 119 00:17:41.110 --> 00:18:09.879 Ivylevel: and her computer science teacher that she's already got the the Ct Award right, which is actually the top kind of computer award in her. I didn't know that I thought that was like just for the Junior year. Apparently it turns out that she actually got that award for the entire kind of classes on the computer. Yeah. So II just feel like, you know. And when I look at all the other I think the showcasing, you know, and again, like, you know, typical like Jenny, like 120 00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:23.990 Ivylevel: too humble right for the American kind of race and then I see some other students like really good at it. So I was hoping. You know, it's a it's a it's a literally like a rural place to be very honest, disconnected. 121 00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:29.490 Ivylevel: And this school is also not one of the top schools. I would say. I think we can definitely 122 00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:47.299 Ivylevel: make some kind of an announcement whether with the community, both here Mhcsd, or at least an apparent news letter that they can actually send. So I would just let you kind of strategize that one of the things that told me that there is an award ceremony. So there is a photo of some sort that might be better. 123 00:18:47.320 --> 00:19:00.709 Ivylevel: But I also want her to come in the radar with her principal that kind of so I think Principal already knows that she won a national award, and I don't even know, like how many kids in her kind of how many girls in our our school are, have actually won one. 124 00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:15.609 Jenny Duan: So I would like to basically share your thoughts on this. probably not very many. I think you can when they publicize it on the website, or, if they have already, can check the names. But, like chance, a good chance is that you're the only person from your school, or even like from your district. So 125 00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:26.089 Jenny Duan: yeah, super impressive, or I don't know about your district cause I think maybe the Bay Area has more. But like definitely, maybe the only person from your school that's very impressive. I would say. 126 00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:31.740 Jenny Duan: do you know who creates the newsletters for your school? Just email them. And see if you can be included in the newsletter 127 00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:52.729 huda siraj: like, so I know that it sends it out with like one person, but like, even for like clubs, like a lot of people try to reach out to that person. To like get an email sent out. But then there's some sort of like phone that they had to fill but like, I'm not really sure like where, like, I can find that 128 00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.939 huda siraj: like I've been trying to do it for empowering AI. But 129 00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:07.950 huda siraj: like there's like a long process like my like my Vice President President for empowering AI. She like tried doing it like November, and they still haven't responded. So there should be a more efficient way. 130 00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.750 huda siraj: I'll probably have to look more into that. 131 00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:17.860 Jenny Duan: can you email the person directly and ask them either for the form link, or just send down, like the publicity information directly. 132 00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.110 huda siraj: Yeah, I think that I think that's better 133 00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:28.200 Jenny Duan: cool. And if that doesn't work like, ask your vice principal secretary like, Principal sorted out. 134 00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:39.570 Ivylevel: Yeah, I think. Also, remember, like one of the programs where I had actually escalated. To Hudas Principal to get the yeah. So. And I had told her told the principal at that time that. 135 00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:51.829 Ivylevel: hey, you know, like don't I mean, I please, you know. Help her otherwise, you know, it's like depriving her of this great opportunity, and you know she just won a national award. So actually, he did acknowledge. Oh, yeah, congratulations are on its way. Kind of a thing. 136 00:20:51.910 --> 00:21:01.690 Ivylevel: I think there is that kind of a background there where she can kind of just pick. And he even asked her like he even asked like for that to show up, you know, like, you know, if she has any issues like, just come and visit me kind of a thing. 137 00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:07.739 Ivylevel: So I feel like, you know, okay, you know, you know, like who that right like. She's also a bit shy and so I feel like 138 00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:12.900 Ivylevel: maybe there's a better way to kind of 139 00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:22.789 Ivylevel: first thing is like, what is the right timing? Right? Do we need to wait for an award? Is there really a ceremony that happens that a photo gets taken, or what does something of that sort happen? 140 00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.279 Jenny Duan: I think there, there is like, there are ceremonies. But I don't think you need to wait for that. 141 00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.780 Ivylevel: Okay, yeah. 142 00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.760 Ivylevel: that's a valid point and 143 00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:47.010 Ivylevel: then then I think that's where you know, probably either. So I think that kind of strategy, because I was talking to is like, I don't know how to do it. And I'm like, you know, this is precisely the kind of help that Jenny can really open up for you where 144 00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:58.660 Ivylevel: she can give you some strategies on how to approach. I think you've already immediately given one like directly go to the newsletter, or you know, you can actually send out an email to the vice principal or their assistant. 145 00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:08.589 Ivylevel: I think any anyone would be actually happy about it. Right? Like so I mean, it brings credibility to the school, too, like, it's good publicity for the school, you know. 146 00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.410 Ivylevel: Yeah, yeah. The other thing I said was actually going through the computer science. Teacher, why not? 147 00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.080 Jenny Duan: That's another kind of 148 00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:33.219 Ivylevel: So anyways, I'll I'll let you. I think I this was something that was bothering me, because I feel like, you know, Huda does all this great work, but I think when it comes to packaging and marketing, and really like showcasing it. I think she's quite quite, quite weak there. 149 00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:43.830 Ivylevel: And it's just her personality right? She's she's quite humble in that perspective. But also, it's important to show right? I would, I would imagine, right, Jenny, like the packaging and showcasing stuff. 150 00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.089 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it's definitely 151 00:22:48.440 --> 00:23:17.999 Jenny Duan: I think it's definitely important, and I also think that what I wanted you can do is you just try to set up like a 30 min meeting with your principal. No asks. Just try to get to know them. I think developing a relationship with your principal is very important, because ultimately, if they're able to write your recommendation letter. That's very powerful thing. So I think, like you should, just, regardless of this fancy wi award thing just like set up in 30 min meeting with your principal just to like talk about your life and like, introduce yourself to them. That should be an agenda item for you, too. 152 00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.650 Ivylevel: Yeah, thank you. Anyways, I'll let you guys talk. 153 00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:37.560 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So I think with everything I'm seeing the opportunity for just like a couple more extracurricular items on your list. So I'll do some brea brainstorming and like, see how we can better incorporate those. 154 00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.590 Jenny Duan: but yeah. 155 00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:46.139 Jenny Duan: I think one thing I'd like to go back to now is just looking at essays 156 00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:58.090 Jenny Duan: back for fact and more summer program applications. So let's kind of touch base on where we stand in terms of some of our program applications. Have you submitted Jcamp yet? And Aix scholars is submitted? Right? 157 00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:03.670 huda siraj: Yeah. Ai. Scores are submitted. But, Jcamp, I haven't started it yet. 158 00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:10.580 Jenny Duan: Haven't started. Okay, so let me just write down our priorities. Priorities. 159 00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:20.589 Jenny Duan: One, I think J. Camp Covid classy can be. Jacob and Covid classy are next, I think, on the on the list of priorities. 160 00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.720 Jenny Duan: Code of classy. I see that you've already drafted that. So why don't we just take a look at that right now? 161 00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.810 huda siraj: And yeah. 162 00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:37.919 Jenny Duan: okay, why do you want to participate in camp this summer? How will you use your new coding superpower and to learn technical skills 163 00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:48.210 Jenny Duan: that I can use to platform civil justice in previous projects I have worked with preexisting surface level coding knowledge to create platforms. 164 00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:54.209 Jenny Duan: maybe you can. You can talk about like 165 00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:00.340 Jenny Duan: how you know how to create websites. But like you wanna apply like new learnings to like. 166 00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:19.439 Jenny Duan: Do you know how to code apps? Have you had that experience? Yeah. So I think it's fine. If you mentioned that you already know how to build websites. Just so they don't put you in the HTML, css, yep, because usually the the progression for code classy is you start in the HTML, css, then you go to app depth, and you go to like data sign. And then AI, 167 00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:36.570 Jenny Duan: just because that's like the order in which the cancer created. But if you already have web development experience, that's not gonna Doc, you like, that's not gonna affect your candidacy for the program. It'll just ensure that you're not placed in like that. Can't you have to learn everything again? And you can learn something different. So I think it's okay for you to mention that you 168 00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.669 Jenny Duan: you know, have already done that. That's not gonna penalize you. 169 00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.679 Jenny Duan: cool 170 00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.540 Jenny Duan: So 171 00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:59.640 Jenny Duan: in the summer to, I want to participate in camp to learn technical skills. I worked with 172 00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.399 Jenny Duan: in time of grace, and she took a stiff folklift. 173 00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:08.880 Jenny Duan: this sentence is a bit clunky. 174 00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.619 Jenny Duan: I created a platform. Let me just say folklift. 175 00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:22.860 Jenny Duan: However, there are many improvements to this initiative. 176 00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:32.519 Jenny Duan: I think you just need to be a little bit more specific about, like, what types of skills you want to learn and 177 00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:47.069 huda siraj: how that's gonna impact. You even talk about how do you think I should specify like like AI or like machine learning, or like, just like maybe like app development. 178 00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:57.799 Jenny Duan: You can say, like, like with a background, with previous experience with web development. I'm excited to learn OP development data science or a ML, 179 00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:05.210 Jenny Duan: and still keep it broad. Yeah, but like, just not web dev, because you've already done that which I think is fine. 180 00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:10.579 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would make this a little bit longer, too, if you can. 181 00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:16.940 Jenny Duan: And just like. I mean this, as this is not super high stakes, like, I'm pretty sure code of classia is 182 00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:29.319 Jenny Duan: is not like highly highly selective, like I think they try to be as inclusive as they can. So I don't think this is like super high stakes as long as you talk about your experiences. 183 00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:36.710 Jenny Duan: So you just roll a little bit more here. That would be fine, and, like you can mentioned some of the other projects that you've worked on. For example, like I mean, she jobs like 184 00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:41.139 Jenny Duan: some other things. You don't have to write a lot of detail just like one sentence, maybe, and then 185 00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.390 Jenny Duan: oh, that should be fine. 186 00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.830 Jenny Duan: and then 187 00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:54.610 Jenny Duan: I'd say, whenever you're ready, you can just submit this like, I don't think you need to spend a super long amount of time on this application. 188 00:27:54.970 --> 00:28:00.369 Jenny Duan: As long as you just check availability, check every single availability, and then you should be fine. 189 00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:19.449 Jenny Duan: and then and then indicate, if you can, if there's an option to indicate, they have a preference for in person camps. I think the virtual camps are really good, too, like I've both done virtual camps and been instructors system for virtual camps. And they're fun, too, and they're really valuable. But I think the in person experiences just a little bit better, because 190 00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:40.579 Jenny Duan: you have to like, connect with everyone in person, and they have really cool venues. That host like I think, like they did they usually do on at Linkedin Headquarters, which is really cool in the Bay Area cause just like Do camp there like for 2 weeks, and I don't know. I think it's just a little bit cooler doing it in person, but online is still great, too. But if you can indicate that you have a preference for in person. 191 00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:48.589 Jenny Duan: and I think, like submitting an application as early as possible is good. So I think, once you've finished, you can just admit I don't think I need to double check this. I think this is like. 192 00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:59.139 Jenny Duan: I think you have a pretty high shot to get into this program. For this one. Talk about like being an intersectional. Yeah, talk about this. 193 00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:11.789 Jenny Duan: This is good and Indian Muslim girl. You can also talk about growing up in like a pretty rural area without like that much technology or like you talk about like the story about like grandpa has like, it's kind of like a farm town stuff like that. 194 00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:23.409 huda siraj: I would not write about Swifty just because of like the personal like Carla Claus Taylor Smith, like it's a sensitive. It's a sensitive topic, I think, even though, okay. 195 00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:30.140 Jenny Duan: there's a lot like pretty much like there's a big overlap between coda classy and swifties like pretty much. Everyone 196 00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.110 Jenny Duan: in code of classy is like a big killer. So again, but I think, like 197 00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:43.630 Jenny Duan: some internal tea is like being on the teaching staff, like, we're not really allowed to like. Talk about that drama like, I don't know, like we don't know what happened, but like, it's a sensitive topic like 198 00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:52.090 Jenny Duan: we don't really know what happened, but like like I remember, I was like community ambassador for total, costly, and we had to do this like 199 00:29:52.220 --> 00:30:03.129 Jenny Duan: Zoom web. Carly would be there, and like we were allowed to like play Tillerson. But that's like, that's like, that's like like internal to the team knowledge. But like. 200 00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:26.130 Jenny Duan: yeah, I don't know exactly like we don't know what happened. But like this definitely, some like actual team, have like, not just speculation like this, and they can probably happen between them, not not necessarily in like the romantic context, necessarily, but just like they are no longer like friends. For some reason, obviously so, maybe don't write about the safety and application, but if you write about everything else it should be good. 201 00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:33.440 huda siraj: Oh, yeah, I want to send the last 10 min brainstorming for the J. Camp application. Could you share your screen so we could look at the as the questions there. 202 00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:36.499 yeah, let me just open up. 203 00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:37.909 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 204 00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:04.000 huda siraj: And then, just like, send me a message when you finish the code of classy application just like after you submitted it. Yeah. 205 00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:27.530 huda siraj: Oh, okay, okay. Good thing we're looking at this right now. Do you have the letter recommendation confirm? That's like the only important thing. 206 00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:32.469 huda siraj: I mean, like, I have like a like a Pdf. From one of my teachers, but like 207 00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.799 huda siraj: I can like I mean I can request it. But like 208 00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.879 huda siraj: I'll try to get them on time. 209 00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.890 huda siraj: But I hope recommendation. 210 00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:47.319 Jenny Duan: Most important thing. Let's see what the requirements are. Is it a direct upload? Or do you have to? 211 00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.020 Jenny Duan: And 212 00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:31.939 Jenny Duan: okay, so first one is, please discuss. These essays are really short. Let's wait. Let's look at what the letter recommendation requirements are. These essays are like 150 words like 250 words, 100 words. That's like, it's okay. It won't be, are not going to be that. 213 00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.910 huda siraj: Yeah, for sure. 214 00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.460 It's fine. 215 00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:55.310 huda siraj: Oh, you can upload them, I can. That's good. Then I have. Oh, perfect. Okay, no, no worries at all. That's good. 216 00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.760 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 217 00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:01.090 Jenny Duan: perfect. 218 00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.999 Jenny Duan: Is your recommendation strong, do you think 219 00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:21.039 huda siraj: I mean like he talks about like how I've been able to like lead. He's also like my media arts teachers. So like, I've helped them like student news, and like kind of documenting that. And like building school culture, he talks about how I help build school culture. 220 00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.430 huda siraj: He's also talked about like 221 00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:33.709 huda siraj: how like I help the new students like like a custom chat student use, does it? Let her feel strong, or does it feel good? 222 00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.149 I feel like it. Kind of feels 223 00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.050 huda siraj: like, what about it? Feels mid? 224 00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:49.519 huda siraj: Okay? So originally like, it's the one where, like he accidentally called me a he but II changed it up a little bit. But yeah. 225 00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:57.430 Jenny Duan: did you give you permission to edit it? I mean, I changed it. But I could probably ask them again. 226 00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.949 huda siraj: No, it's fine, if it's just. I think I was just like a typo. But anyway. 227 00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.820 huda siraj: does it speak to your journalistic? Or does it look addressed? 228 00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.079 huda siraj: Your character and leadership qualities? Let me like, ask you what stood up, I think. 229 00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.680 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, I can I allowed to read? It's not fine with you every day. It's not really. 230 00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.210 huda siraj: And 231 00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:40.969 huda siraj: oh, wait! Hold on! Sorry! 232 00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.700 Jenny Duan: It's love, and 233 00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.100 huda siraj: yeah. 234 00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.450 huda siraj: I don't know it's so slow. 235 00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.929 huda siraj: Wait, let me stop sharing. Let's share again to see if 236 00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:22.990 huda siraj: yeah. 237 00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.720 Jenny Duan: all right, it's like mid. But 238 00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:57.020 Jenny Duan: it's not bad. It's I think it could be more detailed. I don't think it's bad. 239 00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:02.180 huda siraj: I think this is like, I think this is a good no, I think this is like sufficient 240 00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.740 Jenny Duan: of recommendation. I think this is like not going to impact you, I think this is good 241 00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.090 Jenny Duan: and 242 00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:16.669 Jenny Duan: one question, like. 243 00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.120 Jenny Duan: well, I look up something really quickly. 244 00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, other thing. I just wouldn't really want to quickly put on your radar. Are 245 00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:45.249 Jenny Duan: this Camon Impact foundation scholarship? And 246 00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.859 Jenny Duan: there's another scholarship. 247 00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.260 Jenny Duan: I agree. 248 00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.720 Jenny Duan: And then oh, Coolidge squash. 249 00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.199 Jenny Duan: I think, would be good. 250 00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.349 Jenny Duan: 1 s, while I research something. 251 00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:17.220 Jenny Duan: There's some other programs that I think they have some applications opening soon. 252 00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.789 Jenny Duan: That would be good. 253 00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:28.499 I think they have, like one of those questions like, describe yourself in 3 words. 254 00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.779 huda siraj: Oh, for J. Camp 255 00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:49.440 Jenny Duan: camera impact. Scholarship is open. I think that's something that you should apply for. 256 00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.509 Jenny Duan: I think just this is just an aside after this. But 257 00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.580 Jenny Duan: okay. I think. 258 00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:05.769 Jenny Duan: with with application season coming like scholarship application season is gonna be, I think, a really good opportunity for you to demonstrate your impact in like 259 00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:23.940 Jenny Duan: contributions to different areas, and I think you'll have like a really good opportunity for like applying to a lot of different scholarships. I think like something that is pretty good about like. The reason why I bring this up right now is right? Because your dad's doing the start up right now. 260 00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:50.630 Jenny Duan: He's not like working a full time job. So this impacts your family income statement. And I'm saying this because you have like a good shot, if it if this is on your tax records, like, based on this current tax season, that you're desk, not working a full time job, then you have a good shot getting a full ride to the college. Because, like your current income, bracket qualifies for that, because that's not like using startup stuff. So I think like this might change the trajectory of programs that we put you into. 261 00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:55.720 Jenny Duan: if like, like, you are eligible. Now for a lot of like 262 00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.239 Jenny Duan: programs and resources that impact like 263 00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:13.049 Jenny Duan: like lower income communities. Because your dad's like doing the start up thing right now. So this is like, what I'm saying is, this is like a good thing for your like qualification for these programs, because it like. 264 00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.299 Jenny Duan: I think. 265 00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:42.579 Jenny Duan: will increase your chances of getting a lot of awards and things. So anyways, I will look into that a little bit more. But I think there's gonna be a lot of things that you're gonna be eligible to apply for that will give you, like the opportunity to get a full right in college, and like access to a lot of other resources and opportunities that you previously like last year wouldn't have would not have been able to do that. You are able to do now. So that's an aside. But I'll look into that more. I think this is like something that's gonna be a pretty strategic that we can use like strategically for you. 266 00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.219 Jenny Duan: And that's a good way. So I think that'll be good. 267 00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:56.439 Jenny Duan: Okay. What is the 5 word question that you said like 5 words that describe 3 words that describe you 268 00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:05.860 huda siraj: off the top of your head. What 3 words would you use to describe yourself? My songs are kind of negative, but 269 00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.280 huda siraj: shy 270 00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:13.190 huda siraj: that's not probably not a good thing to put on like something about like leadership. But 271 00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.679 huda siraj: II guess. Like observant. 272 00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.419 Jenny Duan: yeah, maybe observant. Yeah. Or like thoughtful, observant. 273 00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.420 huda siraj: 274 00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.439 huda siraj: it's kind of hard. 275 00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:48.129 huda siraj: I'm a kind of sound braggy, but like I feel like empathy is kind of 276 00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:59.980 Jenny Duan: no empathetic, definitely definitely good empathetic. That's not Bragg. This is the whole point of this is to like, talk about yourself. You shouldn't feel braggy at all empathetic. 277 00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.880 Jenny Duan: curious, you can say. Curious. Curious is a pride word. But 278 00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:19.050 Jenny Duan: okay, can we actually do a check in on Wednesday to go over everything? I think, cause we normally have our Tuesday meetings, but I feel like it's not productive to meet tomorrow. I think it's more productive to me on Wednesday, when you have more time to look at this. 279 00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.460 huda siraj: So let's 280 00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:33.679 Jenny Duan: go. And Wednesday the 20 eighth, so we can meet Wednesday, and then we can meet Thursday again. So, if if necessary. So let's meet on Wednesday, the 7 30 works for you, or is there another time that works better for you? 281 00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:38.480 huda siraj: yeah, 7, 30 should be fine. 282 00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:52.820 Jenny Duan: Alright! Let's do another 45 on Wednesday, and then, in the meantime, if you share this document with me, I can look at it prior to our meeting, so that I guess we can be ready to talk about things in detail during that. 283 00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.290 Jenny Duan: I think you're like a really good writer. So I'm honestly. 284 00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:02.620 Jenny Duan: not super concerned about your ability to like crank out an application quickly. I think that'll be something that is. 285 00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:22.849 Jenny Duan: I think, like, you're pretty good at writing, so I'm not really concerned. But I think we'll talk on Wednesday to do another check in and then after that we we can do another meeting on Thursday, if necessary, to to like finalize things before the March first deadline, because February is only 29 days. So you think that you have, like 4 more days, 3 more days. So it's kind of 286 00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:34.479 Jenny Duan: I know it's crazy. Yeah, okay, awesome. And then we'll talk soon. Then I'll I'll tell the support team to get that scheduled. 287 00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.699 Jenny Duan: Okay? Alright, take care.",

Long time is here? 2 00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.439 huda siraj: Oh, yeah, it has been a while. I'm doing really. Well, how about you? 3 00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.650 Jenny Duan: Let's just go through. yeah, let's just go through current updates like life updates in general. 4 00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:21.700 huda siraj: how's everything? So I just recovered from my cold. So it's kind of bad. But yeah, I don't know what's going on. But like, I feel like everyone's been getting sick lately. But yeah, I think I'm feeling a lot better now. But yeah, I did have to like not go to school for some time. But yeah, anyway. I think in general, I think 5 00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:37.449 huda siraj: everything's kind of normal. It's nothing's really happening. We do have like like a we have a sharkting project. Which I was telling you about it's kind of like a really big project in English. And we have like the presentations happening now. And it's kind of grand cause. 6 00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.410 huda siraj: We have like judges like 7 00:01:39.560 --> 00:02:00.590 huda siraj: from outside of school coming. And it's pretty cool. Yeah. what is your project? Again? We like made kind of like, a thing to counteract social media like addiction. So we have, like like games like fun games that are like also educational 8 00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:16.449 huda siraj: and like our teachers, gonna be like the one of the characters in it. So yeah. And then we have like puzzles, and which are like customized like child's interests. To like combat that. And then there's like reach out to people who are like experts in the field and stuff. 9 00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.239 huda siraj: And I was able to connect with like a really really like accomplished author about social media usage. That's pretty cool. 10 00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.820 Jenny Duan: su",
    "per cool, 11 00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.179 Jenny Duan: social media that's super awesome. And when is the project again. Like, when are you presenting? 12 00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:45.850 huda siraj: We're presenting next week. But like, most of the groups are doing this week. But yeah, like, it's like due this Friday. But yeah. 13 00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.799 Jenny Duan: good luck. And and I thank you. Great. 14 00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.240 huda siraj: thank you. 15 00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.490 Jenny Duan: And how is your a push test? 16 00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:04.469 huda siraj: The a push test. It went mediocre. I got a V, so then I I'm going to retake it to try and get a 90 tomorrow. 17 00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.940 huda siraj: So yeah. 18 00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.449 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Good luck. How are you feeling about that? 19 00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:24.970 huda siraj: I'm feeling like, I think I need to do corrections first. Actually. So like, I'm not actually gonna take it tomorrow. But like, I feel like this score was kind of confusing cause. I thought I did. Well, but 20 00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.929 huda siraj: I guess it was kind of hard. 21 00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.210 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think sometimes that happens. And that's okay, too. 22 00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.300 Jenny Duan: How is some empowering AI going? Are you were able to restart the boot camp. 23 00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.530 huda siraj: Yeah. So we had like. 4 to 5. 24 00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:51.989 huda siraj: We had 4 to 5 people like, show up on the day of the first boot camp. Yeah. 25 00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:15.719 huda siraj: yeah. So we got like a few people that join. And II think it went pretty well cause like we had lots of questions that they were like asking. And then we had them like practice, like many projects on their own. And in the end, I think I think the kids really liked it because we did this like really fun. Ca, who like it, was like in the style like our sha",
    "rk is chasing you. And then you have to answer all these questions. 26 00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:28.510 huda siraj: And then, like, I think they really like that. And we did also get like a screen recording. So we're gonna start, like, you know, like publicizing that and and all that. So yeah, I think it went really well for the first week. 27 00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.440 huda siraj: Awesome. And this is the second one happening this weekend 28 00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.669 Jenny Duan: cool? That's totally awesome and super great that before actually coming to that 29 00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.540 Jenny Duan: and 30 00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.710 Jenny Duan: or full flipped. How is that going? Do you have an update? 31 00:04:43.770 --> 00:05:09.299 huda siraj: Yeah. So we did get like someone from brown interested in like writing for us. But but then they like? Asked like, how much do we pay? So they're kind of replying this like a voluntary service. So we're kind of like a nonprofit. And we're just trying to spread the message. So they haven't really like updated us after that. So I think we might have lost them. But I think 32 00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:23.129 huda siraj: I'll probably start like just writing articles on my own, because at this point, because I mean like, although like, it's nice to have like people will do it. I think it's nice to have like a lot of content. So I think I might write some more articles for folklift. 33 00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:42.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah, why don't you try to amplify your work with existing organizations like start and dealing people on Instagram, and ask if they can like share publicized folklore, for example like this is an opportunity for people to send if they work to prepare like anthology, or something like that, and reach out to the like. Like Stanford, sit in, like 34 00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.659 Jenny Duan: all the like college organizations, reach out to their instagrams like pretty much every college campus has, li",
    "ke 35 00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.359 Jenny Duan: a presence in this space, or like a student advocacy group. And I'm sure that, like. 36 00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:01.930 Jenny Duan: they would probably be able to amplify your work if you reached out to them. So maybe email them, or like, damn them on Instagram from your folklift account, and like 37 00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.460 Jenny Duan: be, if they would want to like, just re share one of your posts, or like, submit or share, like a call to action for you. 38 00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.990 huda siraj: Okay, yeah, that's that's a really great idea. I think I'll do that after this call 39 00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:26.520 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Let me know if you need help, like finding organizations. But I think if you just search one organization like starting with Stanford or any other school. Then just look through their followers. You can probably find. 40 00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:53.220 Jenny Duan: I think, like the biggest thing that you should be thinking about with all your projects is just how to publicize them the most. Because I feel like you have really great work and really great initiatives. You just need more people to see it so like amplify your impact. So I think it's such a struggle. But I think that's something that you should be focused on the most right now. Filmmakers club. And how is that going? So I know you've finished editing the trailer. Are you done editing the actual film itself? 41 00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.009 huda siraj: No, not yet. But we are having a meeting. This 42 00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:26.840 huda siraj: Thursday like physically, so that we can like I think I mentioned this last time, but doing like a competition to see like which trailers the best. And then we're gonna put down like soon ease and everything. And yeah, I think for the actual film being edited. I think we're gonna have to first choose a trailer. So that way we can have, like that person. Whoever made the trailer kind o",
    "f like, take a lead for the actual editing. 43 00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.920 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and then 44 00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.920 Jenny Duan: with the game. Are you making progress on publicizing it. Or like, I know that you're in contact with a lot of podcasts, how's that going 45 00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.490 huda siraj: yeah so for one of the podcasts, 46 00:07:42.550 --> 00:08:01.069 huda siraj: we're gonna be filming in April. The other one. I'm actually not sure if if the podcast episode is out yet. But I think they're like mentioning like some Thoria and one of their podcast make sure I find it. 47 00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.959 huda siraj: but yeah. And then I think so. Like publicize it more. 48 00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:14.600 huda siraj: I could probably start like being more active on Linkedin. But yeah. 49 00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:31.320 Jenny Duan: sounds good. I think also. I think now I before we go to your essays. I want to just do like sort of a step back and look at just how your extra curricular and everything is going in general, because I think you still have 50 00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:40.089 Jenny Duan: an opportunity to bulk up your extracurriculars a little bit more, just to ensure that we hit that like 10 extracurricular count before the application cycle starts 51 00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:49.280 Jenny Duan: in. August. So right now, just to recap that, I sure feel like that. I'm like seeing better than most prominent, for you are 52 00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.530 Jenny Duan: empowering a I folklift the Filmmakers club 53 00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.060 Jenny Duan: your game 54 00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:02.200 huda siraj: and how's the the mosque? Wondering. Is that still going? Well. 55 00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.750 huda siraj: can you tell me like 56 00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:17.590 huda siraj: next year? I think I'm gonna try to ask if I can become like the teacher cause once you're like in senior year. I think you're allowed to be a teacher, ",
    "so I can probably step up from there. 57 00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.750 Jenny Duan: That sounds good. 58 00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.750 Jenny Duan: And 59 00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:31.220 Jenny Duan: what else? So apparently 60 00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:43.399 Jenny Duan: And can you remind me, are you? Are you on like a what's it called Regional Leadership Council? Because I remember you mentioning this a few times, but want to confirm. 61 00:09:43.710 --> 00:10:13.450 huda siraj: I'm like a member of the Youth Action Committee. It's just like a local like kind of Youth Action Committee. But I'm just like a member of attended like 2 meetings. But yeah, I remember that you're gonna ask them to to have the zoom link to attend more. How's that? Oh, yeah, I completely forgot about like reaching out to the lady. But I think, yeah, actually send it right now. So that don't forget. 62 00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:23.249 Jenny Duan: How's the like? Is golden games on the table like, how is that situation going? They haven't gotten back to me at all about 63 00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.029 huda siraj: about that. And then they said, they're still reviewing it. So 64 00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.099 Jenny Duan: okay, no worries, I'd say, then that's fine. Just let that be 65 00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.509 Jenny Duan: I think summer program is going to be one thing. 66 00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:48.489 Jenny Duan: so right now we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, completing the summer at the future summer program. Are you for many are you on in honor societies? 67 00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.840 huda siraj: No, I'm not 68 00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.930 Jenny Duan: okay. 69 00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:09.310 huda siraj: Are you planning to join any honor society, I think, for for our schools like a club. Right? So I think in the beginning of the year we're supposed like, apply. And then we like need, like a teacher's recommendation. And like like. 70 00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.919 huda siraj: it's kind of like a appl",
    "ication to a summer program. Basically. 71 00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.040 Jenny Duan: okay, gotcha. 72 00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:27.970 Jenny Duan: okay. So I think if we have room for 3 more extracurriculars. So I would say that maybe what something you can add is more like leadership within an existing 73 00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.589 Jenny Duan: organization, or something that because I feel like you have a lot of self directed leadership. 74 00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.840 Jenny Duan: I would like to see like some more leadership through organization. 75 00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:47.969 Jenny Duan: So I think like by by our next session. I'm gonna do a little bit of research into like specific programs that you can do for like specific committees. You can join. There's something like this committee, but like 76 00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.479 Jenny Duan: on at a different organization that I think could be a good fit. 77 00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.240 Jenny Duan: So I will just research on that. And then, if there's anything that you can think of on that front, that would be 78 00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:14.159 huda siraj: oh, yeah, on Linkedin. I connected with Nicholas from encode justice and I just like connected with them, and I introduced myself. And then I'm like kind of working my way into asking him if, like he if like. 79 00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:21.029 huda siraj: I could work for like the labor section for for, like the board of 80 00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:33.219 Jenny Duan: directly, I think this is like a very low barrier, high impact thing to to be involved in. And you just say I'm interested in joining the advisory. 81 00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.079 Jenny Duan: counsel, I think and say, like you have experience, you know, running in power in a, I like 82 00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:43.799 Jenny Duan: building your game definitely share that cause. I think that's impactful. So yeah, I think 83 00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:55.929 Jenny Duan: I remember, we did talk about this last",
    " time. I do think that that is a good thing to have in your profile as well joining, because in Co. Justice is like a very impactful large organization. And if you connect, can connect with Sneeha actually 84 00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.519 Jenny Duan: ask Nicholas to introduce. you can hold message, Neha, if she doesn't respond to ask 85 00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:26.840 Jenny Duan: Nicholas if you can't connect with Sneha, I can connect you directly with her cause. I know her but I think Stay has, like a good mentor to have as well, because she is super involved in AI ethics obviously as well. She's like spoken, you know, at dog host like world economic Forum, like basically traveled all over the world to like, speak about this issue. So think, having her as a network person. She can also bring you a lot of opportunities. 86 00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.800 Jenny Duan: so yeah, hopefully, if we can get that position, then we still have 2 more spots. 87 00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:37.080 Jenny Duan: that I would love to fill with other things. 88 00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:46.549 Jenny Duan: so yeah, let me do some more research into that and get back to you. I think, having something that has to do with like gaming could be impactful. 89 00:13:46.650 --> 00:14:14.639 huda siraj: Try again and like, really try to reach out for women and games like I could probably like, just like DM, one of the moderators, maybe, and just kind of like talk to them, and then like, ask like, kind of establish, like, I think they mentioned that they really want, like a an ambassador who like talk about like teach like game development. But yeah, like, I think I'll try and express that when I'm talking to them. 90 00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.129 huda siraj: Yeah, I'll try like a little bit harder for that. 91 00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.559 Jenny Duan: Oh, very cool. And how is your own discord? Community going? 92 00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:34.549 huda siraj: Oh, I don't. I don't think that's like a thing anym",
    "ore, like we have like like 3 members. And then I asked him to invite anyone, and they're just gonna I don't know any other game developers. So 93 00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.310 huda siraj: it's just not really working that. Well. 94 00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.900 okay. 95 00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.669 Jenny Duan: no worries. 96 00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.739 Jenny Duan: Okay. Then, I think 97 00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.989 Jenny Duan: this is still something. Yeah, 2 more things you can fill. I think 98 00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:53.160 Jenny Duan: I think that's something related to gaming would be good. And then. Vivian. 99 00:14:53.470 --> 00:15:03.379 Jenny Duan: if I can think about any other like general interest programs to put you into. I think that would be good, too. But let me think about this some more this week. One. 100 00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 101 00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.320 Jenny Duan: cool. 102 00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:22.430 Jenny Duan: I think, depending on how this summer goes. We'll see it when we hear when we start hearing back in March, right about your programs that the case? Yeah, like late March. 103 00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.100 Jenny Duan: late March. Okay? 104 00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:31.159 Jenny Duan: I think, depending on what you end up choosing to do if you don't 105 00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:39.200 Jenny Duan: end up choosing to do a I research, I think, or any type of like tech research. I think it could be good to start over the summer with some like 106 00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.529 Jenny Duan: research initiatives as well. 107 00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:47.140 Jenny Duan: adding something to like something else like technical stemming could be good. 108 00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.919 Jenny Duan: But I think that'll just depend on what program you ultimately end up choosing. But 109 00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.570 Jenny Duan: I think we can go into that later on. I think. Hat club. 110 00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:01.680 Jenny Dua",
    "n: Oh, gosh! I wish you could have gone to the Hat Club hackathon. 111 00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:07.009 Jenny Duan: I think you would have. Really, I think you would have really liked it. But there's gonna be more so that's all, said fine. 112 00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:14.770 Jenny Duan: And I think, having hackathons as as something that you participate in more could also be like an extracurricular item. 113 00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:22.809 Jenny Duan: So maybe like we could do a search for more hagathons in your area, too, like that wouldn't require travelling. 114 00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:36.670 huda siraj: That could be a good fit for you, too. Also, I had a question so like I wanted to like kind of publicize. The Nc. Where award a little bit, and like especially 115 00:16:36.670 --> 00:17:02.969 huda siraj: like my dad was talking to me, and we kind of wanted to like have it like, have like, maybe like articles, or like I don't know. Get mentioned on like the parent newsletter cause, I know, like a few students like they want like some robotics thing. And they got kind of like mentioned a parent newsletter and I was just like hoping like, maybe you could do the same thing for Nc, with like, maybe like an email. 116 00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:15.130 Ivylevel: I can chime in right. I think, thanks to that for using a kind word. I mean, I've been a bit pushy on that. The reason is this right Jenni. I don't know if I told you before, like as I was looking about and see where 117 00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:31.909 Ivylevel: you know, some of the private schools. Actually, even like we're making a news release about it. Right? And I'm talking about like, Hey, 5 students from our school actually got an honorable mention this year. Kind of a thing, you know, because it's actually good for a school's profile. 118 00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:41.110 Ivylevel: Also that woman empowerment angle and also actually gives an opportunity for HUD to come in the radar with her principal right 119 00:17:41",
    ".110 --> 00:18:09.879 Ivylevel: and her computer science teacher that she's already got the the Ct Award right, which is actually the top kind of computer award in her. I didn't know that I thought that was like just for the Junior year. Apparently it turns out that she actually got that award for the entire kind of classes on the computer. Yeah. So II just feel like, you know. And when I look at all the other I think the showcasing, you know, and again, like, you know, typical like Jenny, like 120 00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:23.990 Ivylevel: too humble right for the American kind of race and then I see some other students like really good at it. So I was hoping. You know, it's a it's a it's a literally like a rural place to be very honest, disconnected. 121 00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:29.490 Ivylevel: And this school is also not one of the top schools. I would say. I think we can definitely 122 00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:47.299 Ivylevel: make some kind of an announcement whether with the community, both here Mhcsd, or at least an apparent news letter that they can actually send. So I would just let you kind of strategize that one of the things that told me that there is an award ceremony. So there is a photo of some sort that might be better. 123 00:18:47.320 --> 00:19:00.709 Ivylevel: But I also want her to come in the radar with her principal that kind of so I think Principal already knows that she won a national award, and I don't even know, like how many kids in her kind of how many girls in our our school are, have actually won one. 124 00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:15.609 Jenny Duan: So I would like to basically share your thoughts on this. probably not very many. I think you can when they publicize it on the website, or, if they have already, can check the names. But, like chance, a good chance is that you're the only person from your school, or even like from your district. So 125 00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:26.089 Jenny Duan: yeah, super impressive, or I don't know about your distr",
    "ict cause I think maybe the Bay Area has more. But like definitely, maybe the only person from your school that's very impressive. I would say. 126 00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:31.740 Jenny Duan: do you know who creates the newsletters for your school? Just email them. And see if you can be included in the newsletter 127 00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:52.729 huda siraj: like, so I know that it sends it out with like one person, but like, even for like clubs, like a lot of people try to reach out to that person. To like get an email sent out. But then there's some sort of like phone that they had to fill but like, I'm not really sure like where, like, I can find that 128 00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.939 huda siraj: like I've been trying to do it for empowering AI. But 129 00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:07.950 huda siraj: like there's like a long process like my like my Vice President President for empowering AI. She like tried doing it like November, and they still haven't responded. So there should be a more efficient way. 130 00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.750 huda siraj: I'll probably have to look more into that. 131 00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:17.860 Jenny Duan: can you email the person directly and ask them either for the form link, or just send down, like the publicity information directly. 132 00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.110 huda siraj: Yeah, I think that I think that's better 133 00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:28.200 Jenny Duan: cool. And if that doesn't work like, ask your vice principal secretary like, Principal sorted out. 134 00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:39.570 Ivylevel: Yeah, I think. Also, remember, like one of the programs where I had actually escalated. To Hudas Principal to get the yeah. So. And I had told her told the principal at that time that. 135 00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:51.829 Ivylevel: hey, you know, like don't I mean, I please, you know. Help her otherwise, you know, it's like depriving her of this great opportunity, and you know she just won a national award. So actually, he did acknowledge. O",
    "h, yeah, congratulations are on its way. Kind of a thing. 136 00:20:51.910 --> 00:21:01.690 Ivylevel: I think there is that kind of a background there where she can kind of just pick. And he even asked her like he even asked like for that to show up, you know, like, you know, if she has any issues like, just come and visit me kind of a thing. 137 00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:07.739 Ivylevel: So I feel like, you know, okay, you know, you know, like who that right like. She's also a bit shy and so I feel like 138 00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:12.900 Ivylevel: maybe there's a better way to kind of 139 00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:22.789 Ivylevel: first thing is like, what is the right timing? Right? Do we need to wait for an award? Is there really a ceremony that happens that a photo gets taken, or what does something of that sort happen? 140 00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.279 Jenny Duan: I think there, there is like, there are ceremonies. But I don't think you need to wait for that. 141 00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.780 Ivylevel: Okay, yeah. 142 00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.760 Ivylevel: that's a valid point and 143 00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:47.010 Ivylevel: then then I think that's where you know, probably either. So I think that kind of strategy, because I was talking to is like, I don't know how to do it. And I'm like, you know, this is precisely the kind of help that Jenny can really open up for you where 144 00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:58.660 Ivylevel: she can give you some strategies on how to approach. I think you've already immediately given one like directly go to the newsletter, or you know, you can actually send out an email to the vice principal or their assistant. 145 00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:08.589 Ivylevel: I think any anyone would be actually happy about it. Right? Like so I mean, it brings credibility to the school, too, like, it's good publicity for the school, you know. 146 00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.410 Ivylevel: Yeah, yeah. The other thing I said was actually going through the computer sc",
    "ience. Teacher, why not? 147 00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.080 Jenny Duan: That's another kind of 148 00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:33.219 Ivylevel: So anyways, I'll I'll let you. I think I this was something that was bothering me, because I feel like, you know, Huda does all this great work, but I think when it comes to packaging and marketing, and really like showcasing it. I think she's quite quite, quite weak there. 149 00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:43.830 Ivylevel: And it's just her personality right? She's she's quite humble in that perspective. But also, it's important to show right? I would, I would imagine, right, Jenny, like the packaging and showcasing stuff. 150 00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.089 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it's definitely 151 00:22:48.440 --> 00:23:17.999 Jenny Duan: I think it's definitely important, and I also think that what I wanted you can do is you just try to set up like a 30 min meeting with your principal. No asks. Just try to get to know them. I think developing a relationship with your principal is very important, because ultimately, if they're able to write your recommendation letter. That's very powerful thing. So I think, like you should, just, regardless of this fancy wi award thing just like set up in 30 min meeting with your principal just to like talk about your life and like, introduce yourself to them. That should be an agenda item for you, too. 152 00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.650 Ivylevel: Yeah, thank you. Anyways, I'll let you guys talk. 153 00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:37.560 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So I think with everything I'm seeing the opportunity for just like a couple more extracurricular items on your list. So I'll do some brea brainstorming and like, see how we can better incorporate those. 154 00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.590 Jenny Duan: but yeah. 155 00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:46.139 Jenny Duan: I think one thing I'd like to go back to now is just looking at essays 156 00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:58.090 Jenny Duan: back for fact and more summer pr",
    "ogram applications. So let's kind of touch base on where we stand in terms of some of our program applications. Have you submitted Jcamp yet? And Aix scholars is submitted? Right? 157 00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:03.670 huda siraj: Yeah. Ai. Scores are submitted. But, Jcamp, I haven't started it yet. 158 00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:10.580 Jenny Duan: Haven't started. Okay, so let me just write down our priorities. Priorities. 159 00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:20.589 Jenny Duan: One, I think J. Camp Covid classy can be. Jacob and Covid classy are next, I think, on the on the list of priorities. 160 00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.720 Jenny Duan: Code of classy. I see that you've already drafted that. So why don't we just take a look at that right now? 161 00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.810 huda siraj: And yeah. 162 00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:37.919 Jenny Duan: okay, why do you want to participate in camp this summer? How will you use your new coding superpower and to learn technical skills 163 00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:48.210 Jenny Duan: that I can use to platform civil justice in previous projects I have worked with preexisting surface level coding knowledge to create platforms. 164 00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:54.209 Jenny Duan: maybe you can. You can talk about like 165 00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:00.340 Jenny Duan: how you know how to create websites. But like you wanna apply like new learnings to like. 166 00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:19.439 Jenny Duan: Do you know how to code apps? Have you had that experience? Yeah. So I think it's fine. If you mentioned that you already know how to build websites. Just so they don't put you in the HTML, css, yep, because usually the the progression for code classy is you start in the HTML, css, then you go to app depth, and you go to like data sign. And then AI, 167 00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:36.570 Jenny Duan: just because that's like the order in which the cancer created. But if you already have web development experience, that's not gonna Doc, you like, that's not gonna affect y",
    "our candidacy for the program. It'll just ensure that you're not placed in like that. Can't you have to learn everything again? And you can learn something different. So I think it's okay for you to mention that you 168 00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.669 Jenny Duan: you know, have already done that. That's not gonna penalize you. 169 00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.679 Jenny Duan: cool 170 00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.540 Jenny Duan: So 171 00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:59.640 Jenny Duan: in the summer to, I want to participate in camp to learn technical skills. I worked with 172 00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.399 Jenny Duan: in time of grace, and she took a stiff folklift. 173 00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:08.880 Jenny Duan: this sentence is a bit clunky. 174 00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.619 Jenny Duan: I created a platform. Let me just say folklift. 175 00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:22.860 Jenny Duan: However, there are many improvements to this initiative. 176 00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:32.519 Jenny Duan: I think you just need to be a little bit more specific about, like, what types of skills you want to learn and 177 00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:47.069 huda siraj: how that's gonna impact. You even talk about how do you think I should specify like like AI or like machine learning, or like, just like maybe like app development. 178 00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:57.799 Jenny Duan: You can say, like, like with a background, with previous experience with web development. I'm excited to learn OP development data science or a ML, 179 00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:05.210 Jenny Duan: and still keep it broad. Yeah, but like, just not web dev, because you've already done that which I think is fine. 180 00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:10.579 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would make this a little bit longer, too, if you can. 181 00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:16.940 Jenny Duan: And just like. I mean this, as this is not super high stakes, like, I'm pretty sure code of classia is 182 00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:29.319 Jenny Duan: is not like highly highly selective, like I",
    " think they try to be as inclusive as they can. So I don't think this is like super high stakes as long as you talk about your experiences. 183 00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:36.710 Jenny Duan: So you just roll a little bit more here. That would be fine, and, like you can mentioned some of the other projects that you've worked on. For example, like I mean, she jobs like 184 00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:41.139 Jenny Duan: some other things. You don't have to write a lot of detail just like one sentence, maybe, and then 185 00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.390 Jenny Duan: oh, that should be fine. 186 00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.830 Jenny Duan: and then 187 00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:54.610 Jenny Duan: I'd say, whenever you're ready, you can just submit this like, I don't think you need to spend a super long amount of time on this application. 188 00:27:54.970 --> 00:28:00.369 Jenny Duan: As long as you just check availability, check every single availability, and then you should be fine. 189 00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:19.449 Jenny Duan: and then and then indicate, if you can, if there's an option to indicate, they have a preference for in person camps. I think the virtual camps are really good, too, like I've both done virtual camps and been instructors system for virtual camps. And they're fun, too, and they're really valuable. But I think the in person experiences just a little bit better, because 190 00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:40.579 Jenny Duan: you have to like, connect with everyone in person, and they have really cool venues. That host like I think, like they did they usually do on at Linkedin Headquarters, which is really cool in the Bay Area cause just like Do camp there like for 2 weeks, and I don't know. I think it's just a little bit cooler doing it in person, but online is still great, too. But if you can indicate that you have a preference for in person. 191 00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:48.589 Jenny Duan: and I think, like submitting an application as early as possible is good. So I think, once ",
    "you've finished, you can just admit I don't think I need to double check this. I think this is like. 192 00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:59.139 Jenny Duan: I think you have a pretty high shot to get into this program. For this one. Talk about like being an intersectional. Yeah, talk about this. 193 00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:11.789 Jenny Duan: This is good and Indian Muslim girl. You can also talk about growing up in like a pretty rural area without like that much technology or like you talk about like the story about like grandpa has like, it's kind of like a farm town stuff like that. 194 00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:23.409 huda siraj: I would not write about Swifty just because of like the personal like Carla Claus Taylor Smith, like it's a sensitive. It's a sensitive topic, I think, even though, okay. 195 00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:30.140 Jenny Duan: there's a lot like pretty much like there's a big overlap between coda classy and swifties like pretty much. Everyone 196 00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.110 Jenny Duan: in code of classy is like a big killer. So again, but I think, like 197 00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:43.630 Jenny Duan: some internal tea is like being on the teaching staff, like, we're not really allowed to like. Talk about that drama like, I don't know, like we don't know what happened, but like, it's a sensitive topic like 198 00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:52.090 Jenny Duan: we don't really know what happened, but like like I remember, I was like community ambassador for total, costly, and we had to do this like 199 00:29:52.220 --> 00:30:03.129 Jenny Duan: Zoom web. Carly would be there, and like we were allowed to like play Tillerson. But that's like, that's like, that's like like internal to the team knowledge. But like. 200 00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:26.130 Jenny Duan: yeah, I don't know exactly like we don't know what happened. But like this definitely, some like actual team, have like, not just speculation like this, and they can probably happen between them, not not necessarily in li",
    "ke the romantic context, necessarily, but just like they are no longer like friends. For some reason, obviously so, maybe don't write about the safety and application, but if you write about everything else it should be good. 201 00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:33.440 huda siraj: Oh, yeah, I want to send the last 10 min brainstorming for the J. Camp application. Could you share your screen so we could look at the as the questions there. 202 00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:36.499 yeah, let me just open up. 203 00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:37.909 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 204 00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:04.000 huda siraj: And then, just like, send me a message when you finish the code of classy application just like after you submitted it. Yeah. 205 00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:27.530 huda siraj: Oh, okay, okay. Good thing we're looking at this right now. Do you have the letter recommendation confirm? That's like the only important thing. 206 00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:32.469 huda siraj: I mean, like, I have like a like a Pdf. From one of my teachers, but like 207 00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.799 huda siraj: I can like I mean I can request it. But like 208 00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.879 huda siraj: I'll try to get them on time. 209 00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.890 huda siraj: But I hope recommendation. 210 00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:47.319 Jenny Duan: Most important thing. Let's see what the requirements are. Is it a direct upload? Or do you have to? 211 00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.020 Jenny Duan: And 212 00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:31.939 Jenny Duan: okay, so first one is, please discuss. These essays are really short. Let's wait. Let's look at what the letter recommendation requirements are. These essays are like 150 words like 250 words, 100 words. That's like, it's okay. It won't be, are not going to be that. 213 00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.910 huda siraj: Yeah, for sure. 214 00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.460 It's fine. 215 00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:55.310 huda siraj: Oh, you can upload them, I can. That's good. Then I have. Oh, p",
    "erfect. Okay, no, no worries at all. That's good. 216 00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.760 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 217 00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:01.090 Jenny Duan: perfect. 218 00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.999 Jenny Duan: Is your recommendation strong, do you think 219 00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:21.039 huda siraj: I mean like he talks about like how I've been able to like lead. He's also like my media arts teachers. So like, I've helped them like student news, and like kind of documenting that. And like building school culture, he talks about how I help build school culture. 220 00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.430 huda siraj: He's also talked about like 221 00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:33.709 huda siraj: how like I help the new students like like a custom chat student use, does it? Let her feel strong, or does it feel good? 222 00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.149 I feel like it. Kind of feels 223 00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.050 huda siraj: like, what about it? Feels mid? 224 00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:49.519 huda siraj: Okay? So originally like, it's the one where, like he accidentally called me a he but II changed it up a little bit. But yeah. 225 00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:57.430 Jenny Duan: did you give you permission to edit it? I mean, I changed it. But I could probably ask them again. 226 00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.949 huda siraj: No, it's fine, if it's just. I think I was just like a typo. But anyway. 227 00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.820 huda siraj: does it speak to your journalistic? Or does it look addressed? 228 00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.079 huda siraj: Your character and leadership qualities? Let me like, ask you what stood up, I think. 229 00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.680 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, I can I allowed to read? It's not fine with you every day. It's not really. 230 00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.210 huda siraj: And 231 00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:40.969 huda siraj: oh, wait! Hold on! Sorry! 232 00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.700 Jenny Duan: It's love, and 233 00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.100 huda siraj: yeah. 234 0",
    "0:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.450 huda siraj: I don't know it's so slow. 235 00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.929 huda siraj: Wait, let me stop sharing. Let's share again to see if 236 00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:22.990 huda siraj: yeah. 237 00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.720 Jenny Duan: all right, it's like mid. But 238 00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:57.020 Jenny Duan: it's not bad. It's I think it could be more detailed. I don't think it's bad. 239 00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:02.180 huda siraj: I think this is like, I think this is a good no, I think this is like sufficient 240 00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.740 Jenny Duan: of recommendation. I think this is like not going to impact you, I think this is good 241 00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.090 Jenny Duan: and 242 00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:16.669 Jenny Duan: one question, like. 243 00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.120 Jenny Duan: well, I look up something really quickly. 244 00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, other thing. I just wouldn't really want to quickly put on your radar. Are 245 00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:45.249 Jenny Duan: this Camon Impact foundation scholarship? And 246 00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.859 Jenny Duan: there's another scholarship. 247 00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.260 Jenny Duan: I agree. 248 00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.720 Jenny Duan: And then oh, Coolidge squash. 249 00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.199 Jenny Duan: I think, would be good. 250 00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.349 Jenny Duan: 1 s, while I research something. 251 00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:17.220 Jenny Duan: There's some other programs that I think they have some applications opening soon. 252 00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.789 Jenny Duan: That would be good. 253 00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:28.499 I think they have, like one of those questions like, describe yourself in 3 words. 254 00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.779 huda siraj: Oh, for J. Camp 255 00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:49.440 Jenny Duan: camera impact. Scholarship is open. I think that's something that you should apply for. 256 00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.509 ",
    "Jenny Duan: I think just this is just an aside after this. But 257 00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.580 Jenny Duan: okay. I think. 258 00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:05.769 Jenny Duan: with with application season coming like scholarship application season is gonna be, I think, a really good opportunity for you to demonstrate your impact in like 259 00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:23.940 Jenny Duan: contributions to different areas, and I think you'll have like a really good opportunity for like applying to a lot of different scholarships. I think like something that is pretty good about like. The reason why I bring this up right now is right? Because your dad's doing the start up right now. 260 00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:50.630 Jenny Duan: He's not like working a full time job. So this impacts your family income statement. And I'm saying this because you have like a good shot, if it if this is on your tax records, like, based on this current tax season, that you're desk, not working a full time job, then you have a good shot getting a full ride to the college. Because, like your current income, bracket qualifies for that, because that's not like using startup stuff. So I think like this might change the trajectory of programs that we put you into. 261 00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:55.720 Jenny Duan: if like, like, you are eligible. Now for a lot of like 262 00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.239 Jenny Duan: programs and resources that impact like 263 00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:13.049 Jenny Duan: like lower income communities. Because your dad's like doing the start up thing right now. So this is like, what I'm saying is, this is like a good thing for your like qualification for these programs, because it like. 264 00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.299 Jenny Duan: I think. 265 00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:42.579 Jenny Duan: will increase your chances of getting a lot of awards and things. So anyways, I will look into that a little bit more. But I think there's gonna be a lot of things that you're gonna be eligible to apply for",
    " that will give you, like the opportunity to get a full right in college, and like access to a lot of other resources and opportunities that you previously like last year wouldn't have would not have been able to do that. You are able to do now. So that's an aside. But I'll look into that more. I think this is like something that's gonna be a pretty strategic that we can use like strategically for you. 266 00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.219 Jenny Duan: And that's a good way. So I think that'll be good. 267 00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:56.439 Jenny Duan: Okay. What is the 5 word question that you said like 5 words that describe 3 words that describe you 268 00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:05.860 huda siraj: off the top of your head. What 3 words would you use to describe yourself? My songs are kind of negative, but 269 00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.280 huda siraj: shy 270 00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:13.190 huda siraj: that's not probably not a good thing to put on like something about like leadership. But 271 00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.679 huda siraj: II guess. Like observant. 272 00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.419 Jenny Duan: yeah, maybe observant. Yeah. Or like thoughtful, observant. 273 00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.420 huda siraj: 274 00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.439 huda siraj: it's kind of hard. 275 00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:48.129 huda siraj: I'm a kind of sound braggy, but like I feel like empathy is kind of 276 00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:59.980 Jenny Duan: no empathetic, definitely definitely good empathetic. That's not Bragg. This is the whole point of this is to like, talk about yourself. You shouldn't feel braggy at all empathetic. 277 00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.880 Jenny Duan: curious, you can say. Curious. Curious is a pride word. But 278 00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:19.050 Jenny Duan: okay, can we actually do a check in on Wednesday to go over everything? I think, cause we normally have our Tuesday meetings, but I feel like it's not productive to meet tomorrow. I think it's more productive to me on Wednesda",
    "y, when you have more time to look at this. 279 00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.460 huda siraj: So let's 280 00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:33.679 Jenny Duan: go. And Wednesday the 20 eighth, so we can meet Wednesday, and then we can meet Thursday again. So, if if necessary. So let's meet on Wednesday, the 7 30 works for you, or is there another time that works better for you? 281 00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:38.480 huda siraj: yeah, 7, 30 should be fine. 282 00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:52.820 Jenny Duan: Alright! Let's do another 45 on Wednesday, and then, in the meantime, if you share this document with me, I can look at it prior to our meeting, so that I guess we can be ready to talk about things in detail during that. 283 00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.290 Jenny Duan: I think you're like a really good writer. So I'm honestly. 284 00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:02.620 Jenny Duan: not super concerned about your ability to like crank out an application quickly. I think that'll be something that is. 285 00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:22.849 Jenny Duan: I think, like, you're pretty good at writing, so I'm not really concerned. But I think we'll talk on Wednesday to do another check in and then after that we we can do another meeting on Thursday, if necessary, to to like finalize things before the March first deadline, because February is only 29 days. So you think that you have, like 4 more days, 3 more days. So it's kind of 286 00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:34.479 Jenny Duan: I know it's crazy. Yeah, okay, awesome. And then we'll talk soon. Then I'll I'll tell the support team to get that scheduled. 287 00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.699 Jenny Duan: Okay? Alright, take care."
