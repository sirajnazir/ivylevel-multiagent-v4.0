Come here. 2 00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.130 Ivylevel: Omar Kanya! 3 00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.490 Ivylevel: I think she's finished. 4 00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.769 Jenny Duan: Hey? How's it going? Sorry for being a couple of minutes late I was having issues with my VPN. 5 00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.860 huda s: Hi, it's going. Well, how are you? 6 00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.939 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. Did you get a new headset? I noticed it like last time, but I don't know if I've seen you wear it before. 7 00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.463 huda s: Yeah, it's I got a monitor from my PC, so I've been taking my calls from here. 8 00:07:52.970 --> 00:08:01.805 Jenny Duan: Super cool? Yeah. Okay. So how's your day been going? And what have you been up to since we last spoke? Did you get a chance to email your 9 00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.319 Jenny Duan: email, your teacher or update them about the award for the summer program. 10 00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:17.700 huda s: Yeah. So I think one big update is the sat scores came out today. And I got a 1,500. 11 00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.249 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh, Huna! Congratulations! I'm so happy and proud of you! That's amazing. How are you feeling? Are you happy? 12 00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:43.579 huda s: I'm feeling pretty happy. But I'm kind of surprised by the score breakdown, because I got 7 50 for both reading and math, and I kind of suspected that I don't do really bad in math and really? Well, in reading. So I was a bit surprised to see that. But yeah, I think I'm feeling pretty happy about that. 13 00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:55.489 Jenny Duan: 7, 50, and both is really good. Honestly, I think it's better to have that than be really unbalanced as a student, because then it shows like you're proficient in both categories. So 14 00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.709 Jenny Duan: that's really awesome. I'm so happy for you and so proud of you. Now you can get this big weight off your chest. Yeah. 15 00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:13.820 huda s: Yeah. My dad was suggesting that I take the sec just to get again, just to see like if I could get a higher score. But yeah, like I I'm considering it. 16 00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:17.689 Jenny Duan: You've taken it! How many times in the past! Twice. 17 00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.380 huda s: This is my this is my third time. 18 00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.170 Jenny Duan: Okay, I would say, don't take it again. 19 00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.099 Jenny Duan: because when you submit. 20 00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:31.299 Ivylevel: Don't don't dig it again. Of that. I I was just like, you know, Huda. Actually, Jenny asked me not to share the update to you. 21 00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.559 Ivylevel: So I was just waiting. I just wanted to see this moment. I think she's already done. Thanks a lot for your effort, and also like, Steven. 22 00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:47.290 Ivylevel: Yeah, yeah, awesome. It's all Jenny's. You're under Jenny's guidance. Okay? So it's like, I was just like teasing her. So all good. 23 00:09:47.290 --> 00:10:06.440 Jenny Duan: The reason the reason why I can explain is because colleges, when you submit your sat. Oftentimes they're gonna ask you for your entire school report, which means they can see records of every single sat you've taken in the past. And so when students take, I think 3 is a good number what seems take more than 3 they tend to see it as like they don't. 24 00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.050 Jenny Duan: They don't think that you're like 25 00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:14.080 Jenny Duan: actually like that good at the sat. I think you've just had a lot of prep, or you're like randomly going 26 00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.249 Jenny Duan: to see how many times you can take it. And. 27 00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:16.590 huda s: No. 28 00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.250 Jenny Duan: What they want to see is like. 29 00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:26.800 Jenny Duan: kind of how prepared you are, not naturally, but like the first couple of times, because they don't want you to just like take it more and more and more, and like. 30 00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.290 Jenny Duan: throw around random scores. And I think, like it's fine 31 00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.040 Jenny Duan: since. 32 00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.090 Jenny Duan: since, like if you want, you could take the act, but I think like 1,500 is already good. 33 00:10:38.363 --> 00:10:38.910 huda s: I just. 34 00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:44.189 Ivylevel: I sent you a text, Jenny, I think what I see is something very different. Just look at it! What? And you know what I mean. 35 00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.470 Ivylevel: Look at the snapshot there, right! Look at the trajectory. 36 00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.850 Jenny Duan: Right. That's really powerful, too. 37 00:10:50.850 --> 00:11:01.090 Ivylevel: I think. Yeah, that that's that to me, like, you know, I mean, regardless like, you know, it's from 1,320 to 1,440 to 1,500. I think that in itself shows that 38 00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.029 Ivylevel: there's a transformation there. And I mean again might be. It's not relevant for the college admissions. But 39 00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:13.939 Ivylevel: you know, I think it's really that confidence I want Hood to have in her that anything is possible, like she's again transformed in one more area. 40 00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.729 Ivylevel: So thanks again. 41 00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:24.569 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And thanks to Steven, too. No, this is really awesome. I think it's just like, also, if you were to take it, your only option is 42 00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.800 Jenny Duan: well you get May, but, like 43 00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.739 Jenny Duan: you also have August, but I do feel like there's not a lot of time at the same time. 44 00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.060 Jenny Duan: And like. 45 00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.170 Jenny Duan: if we're trying to go from like a 1,500 46 00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.679 Jenny Duan: to like a 1,600, that's a big difference. But like 47 00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.319 Jenny Duan: a 1,500 to a 1530 is 48 00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.880 Jenny Duan: not big enough of a difference, so 49 00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.960 Jenny Duan: like, how much do you think you would be able to improve if you were to take it again? 50 00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:59.709 huda s: I mean, I would try to get like at least like 30 or 40 points more. It's like a 1530, or 40. 51 00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.450 Jenny Duan: I would say, like that difference is kind of marginal, I would say, unless so the difference sat. Ranges typically are like 52 00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:28.820 Jenny Duan: 1,500 to like 1550 is all kind of the same, and then 1560 to 50, like 1550, ish to like 1590, or 1580 is like all kind of the same, too. And then 1,600 is different. So I'd say, unless you think you can get it for sure up to like 1550 at least, unless you can improve it by 50 or 60 points, I would say. 53 00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.169 Jenny Duan: probably not worth it to retake it. 54 00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:40.100 Ivylevel: Yeah, I mean, I agree with that. In fact, I was looking at some data common data set as well. Right? I think an average of like 1,500 plus is already quite good for all these schools. 55 00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:56.039 Ivylevel: So you know. And I think we again, like, you know, when I'm looking at like Rishi and others. I still believe right? There are 3.8 Gpa people who have gotten in. So I I feel like she's got this amazing story. I mean, she heard back from Tracy newspaper. 56 00:12:56.363 --> 00:13:04.779 Ivylevel: You know, let's focus on those areas. I think she needs to. Really. And I again, this is just my thoughts, and I'll let you chime in and and drive it. 57 00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.489 Ivylevel: But I really want to start to prioritize other things right Jenny, what do you think. 58 00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:27.798 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree with that also, because just the time that it takes to the safety in comparison to the benefit is, isn't my, in my view. Not that worth it, I think. 15 fif, I think 1,500 is the score you should be very proud of, and I think that also, because we can look at the the schools that you specifically want to go to. 59 00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.791 Jenny Duan: and for your top 3 schools, which 60 00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:38.759 Jenny Duan: if I can remember correctly, are, you are you see. Let me just check your schools. 61 00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:46.620 Jenny Duan: I think, for your top 3 schools, Usc. And the other 2. I think that you will not have any difficulties. With the 1,500. 62 00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:03.857 Jenny Duan: I think it'll be different if you were saying like, Okay, I must go to Harvard like that's my number one school, like I think they care more about vanity metrics like the sat score. But I feel like, because you really wanna like the schools that you wanna go to Usc Uci and 63 00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:12.213 Jenny Duan: ucla, you identified as your top 3 schools. I think that those schools 1,500 will be really good or like, you don't need to 64 00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.980 Jenny Duan: aim for like. 65 00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:19.729 Ivylevel: Yeah, even Stanford number one, it's become test option. And I saw the average was 1505 or something. Right? So. 66 00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.749 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So. 67 00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:44.829 Ivylevel: Okay, awesome. Anyways, I'll I'll leave you guys just you know, she actually, I wanted to announce it. And then she said, No way, you know, I wanna I wanna tell. I wanna tell it to Jenny, you know. So she already stopped me. So anyways, I'm so happy that you guys are having such a fabulous journey together, and thanks again for all your effort, and and send out an note to Steven to Huda, and then I'll also talk to him. Thank you. 68 00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:53.080 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, congrats Suda, that's such a big milestone for you, and I think it's such an important step in your journey, because it feels like 69 00:14:53.080 --> 00:15:17.000 Jenny Duan: everything is kind of coming into place now, because I remember, like we first started talking, you were like, Okay, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know about my sat I don't know about like extra quickly, as I don't know about school like, but now, you know, like you've got National Ward. You're going to this incredibly prestigious summer program like this summer program. You you I mean, you saw how competitive it is. Like, you know. I don't need to tell you, but that's gonna be such an exciting opportunity for you. And like. 70 00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.476 Jenny Duan: this is just the big snowball that's like building and building and building, and like more things are gonna start going your way. So I'm so happy. 71 00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.600 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm wondering 72 00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.379 Jenny Duan: back to our our conversation before. Were you able to update your teacher? And how did that go. 73 00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:45.330 huda s: Yeah, he wasn't here today or like the past few days, actually. But I think I might also just send him an email and maybe also tell him like kind of thank him in person as well. I think that would be best. 74 00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:54.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Sounds good. Cool. And then how have you continued reaching out for synthoria? Have you gotten any responses yet? 75 00:15:54.570 --> 00:16:01.038 huda s: Yeah, I actually started like a spreadsheet and also like, I think, I found 76 00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:15.380 huda s: So I did have that call with Rishi, and he was like kind of saying, like tactics of like cold mailing and and stuff. So we kind of did similar thing with like the journalist. And you schedule your email to like 8 am. 77 00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:40.300 huda s: And so I I kind of been attempting to do that with some of the teachers. So I have, like a like a spreadsheet, I can pull it up. I have a spreadsheet. And it has, like all the emails that I've sent so far, and then and then I've scheduled them to like 805 or 8 tomorrow, so that they'll be like more likely to open it because they're they'll actually be on the computer 78 00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:48.869 huda s: computers and everything. And I haven't gotten any responses yet. But I've have like a couple that I've sent out 79 00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.650 huda s: and yeah. 80 00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.760 huda s: but 81 00:16:52.307 --> 00:16:57.609 huda s: oh, yeah. One sad update, though, is, I didn't get into. Gst. 82 00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:08.588 Jenny Duan: Oh, that is really sad. I I honestly think that it's because of your like letter of recommendation situation like I don't think that it was your essays or anything else. 83 00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:20.849 Jenny Duan: So that's really unfortunate. But that's okay. We keep going well. So you wait to hear back from now. So the the conference thing the apple thing. Did you submit it. 84 00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:22.349 huda s: Yeah. 85 00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:30.065 Jenny Duan: Okay. So the conference app with the encoded classy and you're on the wait list for the National High School Game Academy. Right? 86 00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.440 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then are you waiting to hear back from anything else? 87 00:17:34.399 --> 00:17:39.990 huda s: Let me pull up my, I I have like a list of things that we're doing. 88 00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.230 huda s: I believe 89 00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.711 huda s: that might be it. 90 00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.215 huda s: yeah. 91 00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.910 huda s: so 92 00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.520 huda s: on your heart. 93 00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.509 huda s: Totally policy. 94 00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.250 huda s: And yeah, national high school game academy. I think that's 95 00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.630 huda s: that's like the ones we're waiting back for. 96 00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.393 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 97 00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:23.113 Jenny Duan: I think that it's it's okay. Because also, right now, we already have 98 00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:43.790 Jenny Duan: we already have, like a really good summer program locked in, which is, which is good. But I do think that it would be exciting. I hope that you're able to do like something computer science related this summer just because I think it would be like more personally valuable rather than college, valuable because I think college valuable like you're already a little bit set. 99 00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:44.625 Jenny Duan: But 100 00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.369 Jenny Duan: yeah, I just think that would be good. 101 00:18:48.769 --> 00:19:02.289 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I would like to also spend some time talking about breakthrough challenge. I know we started talking about that last time, but I'm wondering, if you have thought of any ideas for the for the for the video. 102 00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.951 huda s: actually haven't, but also, like 103 00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:30.459 huda s: explaining kind of like, how the so I don't know if this is complicated enough. But there's like a part of chemistry that we learn like in chemistry. We learn about like how the earth works like the different like layers. And then maybe like talking about like how mountains are formed, and like 104 00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.560 huda s: stuff like that, maybe, but 105 00:19:33.570 --> 00:20:03.349 huda s: for the other for the other, you know. We there are 2 different science competitions. So I was thinking, maybe since that one also includes mathematics, we could talk a bit more about like data. Science cause that kind of applies to statistics and something I know a little bit more about then. Science topics. So yeah, in terms of science topics, there's not one I'm keen on, but maybe like something about like the earth's like core and everything. 106 00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.430 Jenny Duan: Got it. Okay? 107 00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.960 Jenny Duan: I think that that's really interesting. 108 00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:17.390 Jenny Duan: I wonder? Like, I think they oh, I think your camera is having issues. Where can you see? We can't hear me. 109 00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.799 huda s: Yeah. Can you hear me? 110 00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.288 Jenny Duan: I can hear you, but I I all I see is a black screen. Not sure 111 00:20:25.453 --> 00:20:27.470 huda s: Let me let me try 112 00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.480 huda s: closing and opening my camera. 113 00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.599 Jenny Duan: Sure no worries. 114 00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:38.180 huda s: Let me leave the meeting and come back. Actually, I think. 115 00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.469 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 116 00:20:59.521 --> 00:21:02.409 huda s: I'm not sure why the camera isn't working. 117 00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.120 huda s: Huh? 118 00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:41.059 Jenny Duan: Wait. It's okay. I guess I can. I can hear you. So it's fine if we. If this is a if it's just like this, it's also, okay. 119 00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.085 huda s: Yeah. 120 00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.870 huda s: Why, for some reason. 121 00:21:53.954 --> 00:22:01.680 Jenny Duan: So we're talking about like the core of the earth. And having that be your video project, I think it'd be cool to have that I'm wondering if we can make it 122 00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.326 Jenny Duan: more complicated. So can you tell me a bit more about like, what about the core of the earth. 123 00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.310 Jenny Duan: you're interested in. 124 00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:22.826 huda s: So inside, like the the core of the earth. There's usually like a connection process with, like the tectonic plates. I found that really interesting last year when I was learning chemistry. And 125 00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:48.029 huda s: that's where, like a lot of natural features come in. So, for example, there are mountains that form, when, like tectonic plates collide, and there's ridges and like ravines that form. But when tectonic plates kind of separate so there's like lots of natural features that come from like tectonic plates and I guess like 126 00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.129 huda s: there's also several processes like I think 127 00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.964 huda s: I forgot what it's called, but 128 00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:00.580 huda s: I think where it's like groundwater, like seeps in to the 129 00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:21.059 huda s: like lower parts of the Earth score. I'm not core, but like I guess, like lower parts of the earth surface. And then that's like how many that's like, really useful. It's like farmers and like, you know, just water resources. So I think that's like there's like a lot you could talk about about like the earth surface slash, core. 130 00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:29.497 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for sure. I do think that the topic should be something slightly more complicated that like they can't 131 00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.880 Jenny Duan: that they can't 132 00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:38.749 Jenny Duan: learn. And maybe like school. So is there something specific about that that you're interested in? 133 00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:48.579 Jenny Duan: Because I do feel like like the breakthrough challenge, the point of making. Those videos are like to educate people on things that they wouldn't necessarily learn in school cause it's sponsored by Khan Academy, etc, etc. 134 00:23:48.972 --> 00:23:58.670 Jenny Duan: And that's kind of their motivation. So I'm curious like, is is there something specific about this that you wouldn't learn in school that you want to to talk about? 135 00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:12.780 huda s: So maybe we can shift away from that idea. Cause I think most of it. It's like, really focused at school, like you learn a lot about at school, so I don't know if there's much like specific things that we can talk about 136 00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:19.869 huda s: oh, which are not mentioned at school, but maybe some for some more science topics. 137 00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:31.340 huda s: I don't really know much about it. But if we could like research or if I can research. I could probably write about like 138 00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:45.639 huda s: space and how like gravity works there. Cause there's like, you know, those videos online where it's like people like drinking water. And it's it's just like, really different from Earth. And then, like, maybe explain to kids like, why this happens. 139 00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.384 Jenny Duan: Hmm! That seems good. 140 00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.260 Jenny Duan: what about that? Would you want to talk about specifically? 141 00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:58.170 Jenny Duan: Does you remember, like the level of detail that the example. Winter Amber went into. 142 00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.930 huda s: maybe like explaining like. 143 00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.910 huda s: like, different 144 00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.625 huda s: different. 145 00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.668 huda s: yeah, I'm not really sure like, 146 00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.300 huda s: how to 147 00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.560 huda s: like make it different from what you learn at school 148 00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:38.820 huda s: and like how to make it more specific. Cause I I don't really do science that much like so I don't really have a super specific interest. But like, maybe if I was given a topic, maybe I could like research about that. But yeah, I can't really think of any ideas. I'm super passionate about 149 00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:47.250 Jenny Duan: That's okay. I feel like you do have a lot of time to like, keep on researching and keep on learning. And so I feel like. 150 00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:55.867 Jenny Duan: if you take any of these topics, I think there's enough specificity in the subject itself that you can go in and research it. 151 00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.610 Jenny Duan: yeah. 152 00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.640 Jenny Duan: And I think, like 153 00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.770 Jenny Duan: all these topics are sort of 154 00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:15.409 Jenny Duan: enough where you can go, you can go deeper into each each and every one of these. So I feel like that should be okay. If you you just choose something kind of arbitrarily, but like, go more deep into it. 155 00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:24.818 Jenny Duan: Would you wanna be like, would you want me to tell you ideas, or would you wanna just like go with either the arts core or or 156 00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.659 Jenny Duan: or space, and just pick something specific in it. 157 00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.690 Jenny Duan: Okay, Hi, welcome back. What happened. 158 00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.247 huda s: Yeah, my, my computer, just like, just like, disconnected. 159 00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.580 Jenny Duan: Oh, your camera is also back. Now cool. 160 00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.340 huda s: Yes. 161 00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.450 Jenny Duan: Okay, did you get to hear what I said? Where did I cut off, or where did you disconnect. 162 00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:45.154 huda s: I couldn't if I didn't get to hear like the ideas yet. 163 00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:55.610 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I was. Gonna say, do you prefer me just like giving you more ideas? Or would you like to go deeper into something that you've already mentioned, cause I think, like both could be good. 164 00:27:56.449 --> 00:28:01.250 huda s: I think. Maybe like, if you give like, brand new ideas, cause? 165 00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.879 huda s: yeah, I guess those might be able. We can work with them a bit more. 166 00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.289 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so it has to be something in tech science or 167 00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:18.060 Jenny Duan: math. Within science. I think that things that are interesting to me are like. 168 00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.860 Jenny Duan: maybe like how 169 00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.130 Jenny Duan: how it 170 00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.170 Jenny Duan: actually 171 00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:34.350 Jenny Duan: what is something very specific. It's okay. Let's maybe choose a display. Biology, chemistry, physics, or math pick one. 172 00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.250 huda s: biology. 173 00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.120 Jenny Duan: Okay. 174 00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.118 Jenny Duan: biology. There's lots to talk about in biology. 175 00:28:46.060 --> 00:29:06.450 huda s: Oh, wait! I had an idea which isn't really biology, but like, so I saw a video like, if if we have like black holes. And why don't we just put trash in them to like to like, you know? Solve our trash issue trash pollution issue at Earth, and then maybe I could like debunk that and like, say, like, why, it wouldn't work. 176 00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.006 Jenny Duan: that's interesting. 177 00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.210 Jenny Duan: that's cool. 178 00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:23.720 Jenny Duan: I think something else that could be interesting are like writing about quantum mechanics in physics like a video about quantum mechanics. Maybe a video about like 179 00:29:24.341 --> 00:29:26.599 Jenny Duan: something about the brain like 180 00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:31.199 Jenny Duan: how how emotions are handled in the brain or like how your brain 181 00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.780 Jenny Duan: processes fear or like how memory works, how memory is stored, I think, is really interesting. 182 00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.855 Jenny Duan: maybe 183 00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.859 Jenny Duan: the study of molecular spectroscopy, like 184 00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:53.310 Jenny Duan: how molecules interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation. That's chemistry. But in physics. But that's a little bit interesting. 185 00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.850 Jenny Duan: biology. 186 00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.280 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 187 00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.540 Jenny Duan: maybe like. 188 00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.929 Jenny Duan: I think neuroscience is interesting within. 189 00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.310 huda s: Yeah. 190 00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.280 Jenny Duan: Biology. 191 00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:19.370 Jenny Duan: Like they like. How pound neurons fire like, how do they transmit information to? 192 00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.980 Jenny Duan: I think. 193 00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:24.460 Jenny Duan: like 194 00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.390 Jenny Duan: the heap. 195 00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.029 Jenny Duan: the citric acid cycle, or like the human 196 00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.389 Jenny Duan: metabolism system, is a little bit interesting. 197 00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.980 Jenny Duan: oh, like, maybe something about DNA, and like something related to like 198 00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.380 Jenny Duan: something related to DNA. That's a big topic, but like 199 00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.719 Jenny Duan: something related to DNA, could be cool. 200 00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:54.633 huda s: Yeah, I think DNA is also, I think, maybe my top 2 choices, or something about DNA or 201 00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.450 huda s: something about like the brain. 202 00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.639 huda s: And those 2 options are pretty interesting. 203 00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:06.219 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, so why don't you? Okay, what's out of those 2? What are? What's the one that you're most interested in? 204 00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.112 huda s: I think genetics might be more like interesting to write about 205 00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:24.570 huda s: or I mean, like, make a video about I think, cause there's like a lot we a lot of like different angles we can take or like ex things we can explain. So like, for example, like 206 00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.876 huda s: this isn't perfect, but like, maybe something like 207 00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:39.291 huda s: like how genetics like work, and like, why, why do you have, like a whole set of different genetics, and like your siblings, or something like that. 208 00:31:39.963 --> 00:31:47.079 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, so why don't we pick genetics, plus DNA slash like Rna slash all of that, and then go from there. 209 00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.080 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, maybe it's something. 210 00:31:50.700 --> 00:32:00.369 Jenny Duan: I don't know how many videos are made on this. But like you could be like, do you know that like we share 50 of a DNA, our DNA with a banana. I think that's still true. Yeah, I think that's true. 211 00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.149 huda s: Oh, wow! I didn't know that. 212 00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let me just verify. Let me just verify before I give you fake news. 213 00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.260 huda s: And go. 214 00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.710 Jenny Duan: Let me see. 215 00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.990 Jenny Duan: okay, no, 40%. We're 40%. No. 216 00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.119 huda s: A lot for a banana. 217 00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.969 Jenny Duan: Okay, wait. 218 00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.949 Jenny Duan: Okay. Apparently this is like a little bit contested 219 00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.660 Jenny Duan: own. 220 00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.619 Jenny Duan: wow, there's like people are arguing about this online. 221 00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.140 Jenny Duan: I'll 222 00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:44.420 Jenny Duan: I am. I'm sorry. I think I think in popular science it's said to be 50%. 223 00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:50.647 Jenny Duan: Some researchers debate whether it's 40% or 60%. That's like, that's the consensus. But 224 00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:57.660 Jenny Duan: yeah. So we share a significant amount of our DNA with the bananas. So I think DNA, video for the breakthrough challenge could be really 225 00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.720 Jenny Duan: good. 226 00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.270 Jenny Duan: okay. 227 00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:07.019 Jenny Duan: just just checking. Were you able to submit apple engineering camp? Do some of that yet? 228 00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.240 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. And then for folklift, how's the new social media person 229 00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:15.170 Jenny Duan: and empowering AI like, how's the phasing out? Vp, going. 230 00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:29.604 huda s: Yeah. So so I made like a group chat with, like all the new officers and everything. And we were like planning for future events, and also, like I was updating like what their responsibilities are and everything. So 231 00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:55.840 huda s: so we're kind of like planning like on our social media like, how are we gonna kind of optimize it to have like a larger following? And I think the marketing director, I think she has like she has a lot of knowledge about it. So I suggested, like, Oh, how about we do like 1 one woman in tech every day or every week for like kind of like for highlighting and then she said that it doesn't do well in the SEO 232 00:33:56.133 --> 00:34:02.302 huda s: and so like it might be like wise to like, take post like in a different direction, and maybe like just 233 00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:16.699 huda s: like make more reels and everything and everyone just kind of agreed to be more consistent on like social media and everything. So we haven't started posting yet. But we've like she's been like preparing posts and everything. 234 00:34:17.685 --> 00:34:24.060 huda s: And then so the treasure started like doing the paperwork for the 5 one c. 235 00:34:24.776 --> 00:34:26.050 huda s: and then 236 00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:38.039 huda s: so I I kind of mentioned to the Vice President that like oh, Unfortunately, I feel like there's like a kind of lack of you know. Like 237 00:34:38.453 --> 00:34:53.199 huda s: like movement so far so I think I think we might need to speed it up, or else I might have to like Reorient, the organization. And so she's kind of just agreed, and I think, for now we're keeping her. But if she like. 238 00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:59.673 huda s: just does, this continues to not do anything. Then. I think we? I can remove her, and it'll be fine. 239 00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.879 huda s: But yeah. 240 00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.941 huda s: and we're just trying to like 241 00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:22.220 huda s: we're just trying to like start posting more and also get our AI car competition like up and running. And so they're from like different districts, like all them. So then now I guess we can say that empowering eyes like across 5 districts. So I think that sounds pretty good. 242 00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:38.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. That's super exciting, like that's super exciting across 5 districts is awesome, I think. Like the more you try to get your geographic reach out the better because we could say, like, it's across 10 countries. We could say, it's across like 5 continents like it. These are. 243 00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:53.340 Jenny Duan: I call these like vanity metrics. What like? In reality, it doesn't really matter like whether or not your members are concentrated. I mean, it does matter. But like doesn't matter that much whether your members are concentrated within like a certain geographical area. But it just looks good. So it's like a vanity metric. 244 00:35:53.721 --> 00:35:59.330 Jenny Duan: To to have these things. So yeah, that's that's really awesome. Now, I kind of want to 245 00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:06.430 Jenny Duan: talk about camera impact. Were you able to make any progress on your application since we last talked. I know it's only been like 2 days, though. 246 00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:15.070 huda s: Yeah, I've been trying to work on that. Just that one essay. I feel like I'm struggling a lot with this application specifically because I kind of 247 00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:35.676 huda s: it's just kinda intimidating, and also like I can't think of like kind of how to start it off. So maybe like I can. I need like a little bit of framework, cause I was struggling. But I did for the essay where it talks about location of. I'm pretty much finished, I guess, but I still need to kind of wrap it up and 248 00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:48.889 huda s: connected back to myself. But yeah, and then I removed, like the part where talks about like moving to like a new city. Which we discussed last summer, trying not to send that kind of message out. 249 00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:59.339 Jenny Duan: Got it. Okay? So okay, that's that one, I say, seems like the bottom like, is there anything that I can help with that one? Or 250 00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.920 Jenny Duan: is it just like. 251 00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:02.720 huda s: Yeah. 252 00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.850 Jenny Duan: There anything I can do to help with that? Say. 253 00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:15.866 huda s: With this essay. So like I'm kind of I'm trying to like ended off and like, actually, do you think I'm not talking about like myself, in a sense, essay, or like. 254 00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.180 Jenny Duan: Let's look at it together. Let me go on to the 255 00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:20.969 Jenny Duan: Bucky plan. 256 00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.330 Jenny Duan: Oh, here. 257 00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:43.442 Jenny Duan: this one, right, the this one starting. 258 00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.540 huda s: Yeah. 259 00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.989 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's so symbolic. Starty valley and Silicon Valley, too. 260 00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.290 huda s: Oh, yeah. 261 00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:16.489 Jenny Duan: I think this is too much. This is too much like setting like description of, like what's happening in the game. 262 00:38:16.803 --> 00:38:19.810 Jenny Duan: I feel like there should be like 1, 2 paragraphs. Max. 263 00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.559 Jenny Duan: like this, this part, all of this. 264 00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.640 huda s: Okay. 265 00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.989 Jenny Duan: This can be condensed. I think it should be more about you. 266 00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:30.670 huda s: so 267 00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.950 huda s: I kind of. 268 00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:38.189 huda s: I kind of need this part where it talks about like Jojo, Mart, which is like 269 00:38:39.080 --> 00:39:00.588 huda s: the one like like one side of the, I guess, like choice where they have to choose between like opportunities, but, like, you know, isolated and not like part of a community. And then there's like, the community center, which is like beneficial to all. And it's just like building opportunities in in like the middle of nowhere. 270 00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:05.459 huda s: I guess. That's like kind of like the 2 sides. So I kind of. 271 00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:14.770 huda s: I feel like I have to contextualize it, but I don't know if I'm like doing it too much like. Can you like, say, like what things you think I should most remove. 272 00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.010 Jenny Duan: I think 273 00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:28.400 Jenny Duan: oh, hey! 274 00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:28.990 huda s: Clint. 275 00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.190 Jenny Duan: The the. The small rural town stuff can like 276 00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:36.629 Jenny Duan: could be put here before town like it can kind of just be shoved there. 277 00:39:39.663 --> 00:39:40.510 huda s: This part. 278 00:39:42.909 --> 00:39:47.519 Jenny Duan: No like any description, like any physical description of the town 279 00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.150 Jenny Duan: can be put here. 280 00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:58.979 huda s: Hmm! I think the reason why I put this like the like. The description about the community center was here was because like 281 00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.909 huda s: it was like the part would ask, like, make a decision? Between the 2, 282 00:40:06.361 --> 00:40:12.099 huda s: between the 2, like options of building the community Center or Georgia mark. 283 00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.460 Jenny Duan: Okay. 284 00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.839 Jenny Duan: see what else could be made? 285 00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:39.089 Jenny Duan: this is like too descriptive, like these 2 paragraphs, I think, basically say the same thing. 286 00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.600 Jenny Duan: Like 287 00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.380 Jenny Duan: in different ways. I think you just choose one of these, and like cut it down 288 00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.330 Jenny Duan: in the moon. 289 00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.729 Jenny Duan: and I think you should give the character a name. 290 00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.400 huda s: Alright sounds good. 291 00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.489 Jenny Duan: This would just be like one sentence. I don't think you need all of this descriptive language here. 292 00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:17.369 Jenny Duan: You can even take down this entire paragraph. Because I feel like this says. 293 00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:24.869 Jenny Duan: like these 2, like the 2 paragraphs before. If you undo that, yeah, like these 2 paragraphs basically say the same thing. 294 00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:27.730 huda s: They sue. 295 00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.319 Jenny Duan: Right like it's all about the character like deciding whether or not they want to. 296 00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:41.709 Jenny Duan: take the leap, and, like, you know, change the life or or not. 297 00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:55.799 huda s: and I combine them. I feel like some imagery might be like 298 00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.600 huda s: like necessary for. 299 00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:04.710 Jenny Duan: Maybe keep one of the sentences from the imagery one, and then just confine them, and then delete one of their questions. 300 00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.995 huda s: Yeah, okay, I I think I kept this one. 301 00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.180 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. 302 00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:42.269 Jenny Duan: okay, I think other than that. I I think the beginning is still too long. But I 303 00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.470 Jenny Duan: I think this vine sentence can be deleted. 304 00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.909 huda s: So. No no imagery about the. 305 00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.980 Jenny Duan: I think it's okay. 306 00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.320 huda s: Alright! 307 00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:01.589 Jenny Duan: Maybe add here, like a little clause that's like something about the vines. 308 00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.639 huda s: Okay, let me just. 309 00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.963 Jenny Duan: I feel like this paragraph, and this paragraph could also be shortened because they all seem pretty similar to 310 00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.050 Jenny Duan: like. I don't think the reader cares that much about the game, like, I think. 311 00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:36.009 Jenny Duan: Unfortunately, they just want to hear about your life, too, in the in the game just provides context for your life. So I feel like that part. The detail about Starting Valley, while important, should be as short as possible. 312 00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.200 huda s: Really. 313 00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:45.270 huda s: But I wanna I wanna bring out like that 314 00:43:45.747 --> 00:43:53.780 huda s: like, maybe like, of course, need a short note. But I think, maybe, how do I be able to implement the fact that the the character kind of 315 00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.360 huda s: chose community over, like, you know, self 316 00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.400 huda s: growth. But in in like a way that doesn't really like 317 00:44:00.975 --> 00:44:10.440 huda s: show in a bad light, and also like I can set it up so that then I can start talking about myself, and like how I see myself in this game. 318 00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:12.290 Jenny Duan: Okay. 319 00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.910 Jenny Duan: I think 320 00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.100 Jenny Duan: a 321 00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:38.640 Jenny Duan: but the character man is somewhere out of nowhere. Maybe you could. Instead of saying this, you can say, like 322 00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.759 Jenny Duan: mountain House. California is my 323 00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.020 Jenny Duan: is my nowhere. 324 00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.329 Jenny Duan: but I've like spent my like 325 00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.529 Jenny Duan: you can say. 326 00:44:51.690 --> 00:45:09.410 Jenny Duan: But I said my time like doing Xyz to transform it into like with the hopes of fully transforming it into a somewhere, but like something like that, like Mounthouse, California is like nowhere surrounded by the smell of manure every day. I 327 00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:18.320 Jenny Duan: like blank, blank, blank, blank, like whatever you do. And then you can say like, in time, like it will, it will become a somewhere or something like that. 328 00:45:20.557 --> 00:45:29.430 huda s: maybe like, through my efforts and those around me. We'll, be able to transform mountain house into somewhere. 329 00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's good. 330 00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:53.329 huda s: And then we I and then should we talk about? Should I talk about like a startup manure? Should? Is this where I talk about like my activities, like 331 00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.820 huda s: like things that I do to make progress better or. 332 00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:07.859 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like what your concrete effort and impact is like, I think, camera impact. They they really care about your effort and like what you've actually done. 333 00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.270 Jenny Duan: And so yeah, that's why. 334 00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.430 Jenny Duan: Okay. 335 00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:29.469 Jenny Duan: I think with the rest of this essay, I think once you like finish writing it, we can go back and edit, and it'll give it more shape. 336 00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:30.650 huda s: Yeah. 337 00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:35.779 huda s: also. For the other essays. I was hoping like, maybe 338 00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:43.830 huda s: we'd write like like a framework or some something like that, because I'm I'm kind of like stuck, and I I don't know how to start. 339 00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.160 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't, I think. Let's 340 00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:54.599 Jenny Duan: let's spend some time we meet next in like what? 2 days? One. No, let me see, when our next meeting is 341 00:46:54.730 --> 00:47:02.250 Jenny Duan: yeah, 2 days to to do that, I think. Finish this essay first, and then I think next time we meet we'll 342 00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:09.029 Jenny Duan: look over this essay, and then come up with the frameworks for the other 2, and I think that will be set there. 343 00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.030 huda s: Alright, sounds good. 344 00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.939 Jenny Duan: Do you have any other questions? 345 00:47:14.767 --> 00:47:17.900 huda s: No, I think I think that's good. 346 00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:24.333 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. Then I'll see you in like 2 days. I think it's Saturday, Saturday evening for you. 347 00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:31.660 Jenny Duan: and we'll spend some more time talking about this congratulations again on your sat score, and make sure to tell Steven I'm sure he'll be really happy as well. 348 00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.390 huda s: Yeah, thank you so much. 349 00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.799 Jenny Duan: Of course. Take care, bye, bye.",

Come here. 2 00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.130 Ivylevel: Omar Kanya! 3 00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.490 Ivylevel: I think she's finished. 4 00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.769 Jenny Duan: Hey? How's it going? Sorry for being a couple of minutes late I was having issues with my VPN. 5 00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.860 huda s: Hi, it's going. Well, how are you? 6 00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.939 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. Did you get a new headset? I noticed it like last time, but I don't know if I've seen you wear it before. 7 00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.463 huda s: Yeah, it's I got a monitor from my PC, so I've been taking my calls from here. 8 00:07:52.970 --> 00:08:01.805 Jenny Duan: Super cool? Yeah. Okay. So how's your day been going? And what have you been up to since we last spoke? Did you get a chance to email your 9 00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.319 Jenny Duan: email, your teacher or update them about the award for the summer program. 10 00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:17.700 huda s: Yeah. So I think one big update is the sat scores came out today. And I got a 1,500. 11 00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.249 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh, Huna! Congratulations! I'm so happy and proud of you! That's amazing. How are you feeling? Are you happy? 12 00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:43.579 huda s: I'm feeling pretty happy. But I'm kind of surprised by the score breakdown, because I got 7 50 for both reading and math, and I kind of suspected that I don't do really bad in math and really? Well, in reading. So I was a bit surprised to see that. But yeah, I think I'm feeling pretty happy about that. 13 00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:55.489 Jenny Duan: 7, 50, and both is really good. Honestly, I think it's better to have that than be really unbalanced as a student, because then it shows like you're proficient in both categories. So 14 00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.709 Jenny Duan: that's really",
    " awesome. I'm so happy for you and so proud of you. Now you can get this big weight off your chest. Yeah. 15 00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:13.820 huda s: Yeah. My dad was suggesting that I take the sec just to get again, just to see like if I could get a higher score. But yeah, like I I'm considering it. 16 00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:17.689 Jenny Duan: You've taken it! How many times in the past! Twice. 17 00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.380 huda s: This is my this is my third time. 18 00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.170 Jenny Duan: Okay, I would say, don't take it again. 19 00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.099 Jenny Duan: because when you submit. 20 00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:31.299 Ivylevel: Don't don't dig it again. Of that. I I was just like, you know, Huda. Actually, Jenny asked me not to share the update to you. 21 00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.559 Ivylevel: So I was just waiting. I just wanted to see this moment. I think she's already done. Thanks a lot for your effort, and also like, Steven. 22 00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:47.290 Ivylevel: Yeah, yeah, awesome. It's all Jenny's. You're under Jenny's guidance. Okay? So it's like, I was just like teasing her. So all good. 23 00:09:47.290 --> 00:10:06.440 Jenny Duan: The reason the reason why I can explain is because colleges, when you submit your sat. Oftentimes they're gonna ask you for your entire school report, which means they can see records of every single sat you've taken in the past. And so when students take, I think 3 is a good number what seems take more than 3 they tend to see it as like they don't. 24 00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.050 Jenny Duan: They don't think that you're like 25 00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:14.080 Jenny Duan: actually like that good at the sat. I think you've just had a lot of prep, or you're like randomly going 26 00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.249 Jenny Duan: to see how many times you can take it. And. 27 00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:16.590 huda s: No. 28 00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.250 Jenny Duan: What they want to see is like. 29 00:10:18.",
    "690 --> 00:10:26.800 Jenny Duan: kind of how prepared you are, not naturally, but like the first couple of times, because they don't want you to just like take it more and more and more, and like. 30 00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.290 Jenny Duan: throw around random scores. And I think, like it's fine 31 00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.040 Jenny Duan: since. 32 00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.090 Jenny Duan: since, like if you want, you could take the act, but I think like 1,500 is already good. 33 00:10:38.363 --> 00:10:38.910 huda s: I just. 34 00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:44.189 Ivylevel: I sent you a text, Jenny, I think what I see is something very different. Just look at it! What? And you know what I mean. 35 00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.470 Ivylevel: Look at the snapshot there, right! Look at the trajectory. 36 00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.850 Jenny Duan: Right. That's really powerful, too. 37 00:10:50.850 --> 00:11:01.090 Ivylevel: I think. Yeah, that that's that to me, like, you know, I mean, regardless like, you know, it's from 1,320 to 1,440 to 1,500. I think that in itself shows that 38 00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.029 Ivylevel: there's a transformation there. And I mean again might be. It's not relevant for the college admissions. But 39 00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:13.939 Ivylevel: you know, I think it's really that confidence I want Hood to have in her that anything is possible, like she's again transformed in one more area. 40 00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.729 Ivylevel: So thanks again. 41 00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:24.569 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And thanks to Steven, too. No, this is really awesome. I think it's just like, also, if you were to take it, your only option is 42 00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.800 Jenny Duan: well you get May, but, like 43 00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.739 Jenny Duan: you also have August, but I do feel like there's not a lot of time at the same time. 44 00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.060 Jenny Duan: And like. 45 00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.170 Jenny Duan: if we're trying to go from like",
    " a 1,500 46 00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.679 Jenny Duan: to like a 1,600, that's a big difference. But like 47 00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.319 Jenny Duan: a 1,500 to a 1530 is 48 00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.880 Jenny Duan: not big enough of a difference, so 49 00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.960 Jenny Duan: like, how much do you think you would be able to improve if you were to take it again? 50 00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:59.709 huda s: I mean, I would try to get like at least like 30 or 40 points more. It's like a 1530, or 40. 51 00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.450 Jenny Duan: I would say, like that difference is kind of marginal, I would say, unless so the difference sat. Ranges typically are like 52 00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:28.820 Jenny Duan: 1,500 to like 1550 is all kind of the same, and then 1560 to 50, like 1550, ish to like 1590, or 1580 is like all kind of the same, too. And then 1,600 is different. So I'd say, unless you think you can get it for sure up to like 1550 at least, unless you can improve it by 50 or 60 points, I would say. 53 00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.169 Jenny Duan: probably not worth it to retake it. 54 00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:40.100 Ivylevel: Yeah, I mean, I agree with that. In fact, I was looking at some data common data set as well. Right? I think an average of like 1,500 plus is already quite good for all these schools. 55 00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:56.039 Ivylevel: So you know. And I think we again, like, you know, when I'm looking at like Rishi and others. I still believe right? There are 3.8 Gpa people who have gotten in. So I I feel like she's got this amazing story. I mean, she heard back from Tracy newspaper. 56 00:12:56.363 --> 00:13:04.779 Ivylevel: You know, let's focus on those areas. I think she needs to. Really. And I again, this is just my thoughts, and I'll let you chime in and and drive it. 57 00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.489 Ivylevel: But I really want to start to prioritize other things right Jenny, what do you think. 58 00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:27.798 Jenn",
    "y Duan: Yeah, I agree with that also, because just the time that it takes to the safety in comparison to the benefit is, isn't my, in my view. Not that worth it, I think. 15 fif, I think 1,500 is the score you should be very proud of, and I think that also, because we can look at the the schools that you specifically want to go to. 59 00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.791 Jenny Duan: and for your top 3 schools, which 60 00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:38.759 Jenny Duan: if I can remember correctly, are, you are you see. Let me just check your schools. 61 00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:46.620 Jenny Duan: I think, for your top 3 schools, Usc. And the other 2. I think that you will not have any difficulties. With the 1,500. 62 00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:03.857 Jenny Duan: I think it'll be different if you were saying like, Okay, I must go to Harvard like that's my number one school, like I think they care more about vanity metrics like the sat score. But I feel like, because you really wanna like the schools that you wanna go to Usc Uci and 63 00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:12.213 Jenny Duan: ucla, you identified as your top 3 schools. I think that those schools 1,500 will be really good or like, you don't need to 64 00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.980 Jenny Duan: aim for like. 65 00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:19.729 Ivylevel: Yeah, even Stanford number one, it's become test option. And I saw the average was 1505 or something. Right? So. 66 00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.749 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So. 67 00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:44.829 Ivylevel: Okay, awesome. Anyways, I'll I'll leave you guys just you know, she actually, I wanted to announce it. And then she said, No way, you know, I wanna I wanna tell. I wanna tell it to Jenny, you know. So she already stopped me. So anyways, I'm so happy that you guys are having such a fabulous journey together, and thanks again for all your effort, and and send out an note to Steven to Huda, and then I'll also talk to him. Thank you. 68 00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:53.080 Jenny Duan: Aweso",
    "me. Well, congrats Suda, that's such a big milestone for you, and I think it's such an important step in your journey, because it feels like 69 00:14:53.080 --> 00:15:17.000 Jenny Duan: everything is kind of coming into place now, because I remember, like we first started talking, you were like, Okay, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know about my sat I don't know about like extra quickly, as I don't know about school like, but now, you know, like you've got National Ward. You're going to this incredibly prestigious summer program like this summer program. You you I mean, you saw how competitive it is. Like, you know. I don't need to tell you, but that's gonna be such an exciting opportunity for you. And like. 70 00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.476 Jenny Duan: this is just the big snowball that's like building and building and building, and like more things are gonna start going your way. So I'm so happy. 71 00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.600 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm wondering 72 00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.379 Jenny Duan: back to our our conversation before. Were you able to update your teacher? And how did that go. 73 00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:45.330 huda s: Yeah, he wasn't here today or like the past few days, actually. But I think I might also just send him an email and maybe also tell him like kind of thank him in person as well. I think that would be best. 74 00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:54.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Sounds good. Cool. And then how have you continued reaching out for synthoria? Have you gotten any responses yet? 75 00:15:54.570 --> 00:16:01.038 huda s: Yeah, I actually started like a spreadsheet and also like, I think, I found 76 00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:15.380 huda s: So I did have that call with Rishi, and he was like kind of saying, like tactics of like cold mailing and and stuff. So we kind of did similar thing with like the journalist. And you schedule your email to like 8 am. 77 00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:40.300 huda s: And so I I kind of been attempting to do",
    " that with some of the teachers. So I have, like a like a spreadsheet, I can pull it up. I have a spreadsheet. And it has, like all the emails that I've sent so far, and then and then I've scheduled them to like 805 or 8 tomorrow, so that they'll be like more likely to open it because they're they'll actually be on the computer 78 00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:48.869 huda s: computers and everything. And I haven't gotten any responses yet. But I've have like a couple that I've sent out 79 00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.650 huda s: and yeah. 80 00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.760 huda s: but 81 00:16:52.307 --> 00:16:57.609 huda s: oh, yeah. One sad update, though, is, I didn't get into. Gst. 82 00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:08.588 Jenny Duan: Oh, that is really sad. I I honestly think that it's because of your like letter of recommendation situation like I don't think that it was your essays or anything else. 83 00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:20.849 Jenny Duan: So that's really unfortunate. But that's okay. We keep going well. So you wait to hear back from now. So the the conference thing the apple thing. Did you submit it. 84 00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:22.349 huda s: Yeah. 85 00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:30.065 Jenny Duan: Okay. So the conference app with the encoded classy and you're on the wait list for the National High School Game Academy. Right? 86 00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.440 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then are you waiting to hear back from anything else? 87 00:17:34.399 --> 00:17:39.990 huda s: Let me pull up my, I I have like a list of things that we're doing. 88 00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.230 huda s: I believe 89 00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.711 huda s: that might be it. 90 00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.215 huda s: yeah. 91 00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.910 huda s: so 92 00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.520 huda s: on your heart. 93 00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.509 huda s: Totally policy. 94 00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.250 huda s: And yeah, national high school game academy. I think that's 95 00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.630 hud",
    "a s: that's like the ones we're waiting back for. 96 00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.393 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 97 00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:23.113 Jenny Duan: I think that it's it's okay. Because also, right now, we already have 98 00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:43.790 Jenny Duan: we already have, like a really good summer program locked in, which is, which is good. But I do think that it would be exciting. I hope that you're able to do like something computer science related this summer just because I think it would be like more personally valuable rather than college, valuable because I think college valuable like you're already a little bit set. 99 00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:44.625 Jenny Duan: But 100 00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.369 Jenny Duan: yeah, I just think that would be good. 101 00:18:48.769 --> 00:19:02.289 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I would like to also spend some time talking about breakthrough challenge. I know we started talking about that last time, but I'm wondering, if you have thought of any ideas for the for the for the video. 102 00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.951 huda s: actually haven't, but also, like 103 00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:30.459 huda s: explaining kind of like, how the so I don't know if this is complicated enough. But there's like a part of chemistry that we learn like in chemistry. We learn about like how the earth works like the different like layers. And then maybe like talking about like how mountains are formed, and like 104 00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.560 huda s: stuff like that, maybe, but 105 00:19:33.570 --> 00:20:03.349 huda s: for the other for the other, you know. We there are 2 different science competitions. So I was thinking, maybe since that one also includes mathematics, we could talk a bit more about like data. Science cause that kind of applies to statistics and something I know a little bit more about then. Science topics. So yeah, in terms of science topics, there's not one I'm keen on, but maybe like something about like the earth's like core and",
    " everything. 106 00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.430 Jenny Duan: Got it. Okay? 107 00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.960 Jenny Duan: I think that that's really interesting. 108 00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:17.390 Jenny Duan: I wonder? Like, I think they oh, I think your camera is having issues. Where can you see? We can't hear me. 109 00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.799 huda s: Yeah. Can you hear me? 110 00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.288 Jenny Duan: I can hear you, but I I all I see is a black screen. Not sure 111 00:20:25.453 --> 00:20:27.470 huda s: Let me let me try 112 00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.480 huda s: closing and opening my camera. 113 00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.599 Jenny Duan: Sure no worries. 114 00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:38.180 huda s: Let me leave the meeting and come back. Actually, I think. 115 00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.469 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 116 00:20:59.521 --> 00:21:02.409 huda s: I'm not sure why the camera isn't working. 117 00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.120 huda s: Huh? 118 00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:41.059 Jenny Duan: Wait. It's okay. I guess I can. I can hear you. So it's fine if we. If this is a if it's just like this, it's also, okay. 119 00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.085 huda s: Yeah. 120 00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.870 huda s: Why, for some reason. 121 00:21:53.954 --> 00:22:01.680 Jenny Duan: So we're talking about like the core of the earth. And having that be your video project, I think it'd be cool to have that I'm wondering if we can make it 122 00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.326 Jenny Duan: more complicated. So can you tell me a bit more about like, what about the core of the earth. 123 00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.310 Jenny Duan: you're interested in. 124 00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:22.826 huda s: So inside, like the the core of the earth. There's usually like a connection process with, like the tectonic plates. I found that really interesting last year when I was learning chemistry. And 125 00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:48.029 huda s: that's where, like a lot of natural features come in. So, f",
    "or example, there are mountains that form, when, like tectonic plates collide, and there's ridges and like ravines that form. But when tectonic plates kind of separate so there's like lots of natural features that come from like tectonic plates and I guess like 126 00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.129 huda s: there's also several processes like I think 127 00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.964 huda s: I forgot what it's called, but 128 00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:00.580 huda s: I think where it's like groundwater, like seeps in to the 129 00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:21.059 huda s: like lower parts of the Earth score. I'm not core, but like I guess, like lower parts of the earth surface. And then that's like how many that's like, really useful. It's like farmers and like, you know, just water resources. So I think that's like there's like a lot you could talk about about like the earth surface slash, core. 130 00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:29.497 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for sure. I do think that the topic should be something slightly more complicated that like they can't 131 00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.880 Jenny Duan: that they can't 132 00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:38.749 Jenny Duan: learn. And maybe like school. So is there something specific about that that you're interested in? 133 00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:48.579 Jenny Duan: Because I do feel like like the breakthrough challenge, the point of making. Those videos are like to educate people on things that they wouldn't necessarily learn in school cause it's sponsored by Khan Academy, etc, etc. 134 00:23:48.972 --> 00:23:58.670 Jenny Duan: And that's kind of their motivation. So I'm curious like, is is there something specific about this that you wouldn't learn in school that you want to to talk about? 135 00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:12.780 huda s: So maybe we can shift away from that idea. Cause I think most of it. It's like, really focused at school, like you learn a lot about at school, so I don't know if there's much like specific things that we can talk about 13",
    "6 00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:19.869 huda s: oh, which are not mentioned at school, but maybe some for some more science topics. 137 00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:31.340 huda s: I don't really know much about it. But if we could like research or if I can research. I could probably write about like 138 00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:45.639 huda s: space and how like gravity works there. Cause there's like, you know, those videos online where it's like people like drinking water. And it's it's just like, really different from Earth. And then, like, maybe explain to kids like, why this happens. 139 00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.384 Jenny Duan: Hmm! That seems good. 140 00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.260 Jenny Duan: what about that? Would you want to talk about specifically? 141 00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:58.170 Jenny Duan: Does you remember, like the level of detail that the example. Winter Amber went into. 142 00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.930 huda s: maybe like explaining like. 143 00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.910 huda s: like, different 144 00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.625 huda s: different. 145 00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.668 huda s: yeah, I'm not really sure like, 146 00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.300 huda s: how to 147 00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.560 huda s: like make it different from what you learn at school 148 00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:38.820 huda s: and like how to make it more specific. Cause I I don't really do science that much like so I don't really have a super specific interest. But like, maybe if I was given a topic, maybe I could like research about that. But yeah, I can't really think of any ideas. I'm super passionate about 149 00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:47.250 Jenny Duan: That's okay. I feel like you do have a lot of time to like, keep on researching and keep on learning. And so I feel like. 150 00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:55.867 Jenny Duan: if you take any of these topics, I think there's enough specificity in the subject itself that you can go in and research it. 151 00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.610 Jenny Duan",
    ": yeah. 152 00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.640 Jenny Duan: And I think, like 153 00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.770 Jenny Duan: all these topics are sort of 154 00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:15.409 Jenny Duan: enough where you can go, you can go deeper into each each and every one of these. So I feel like that should be okay. If you you just choose something kind of arbitrarily, but like, go more deep into it. 155 00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:24.818 Jenny Duan: Would you wanna be like, would you want me to tell you ideas, or would you wanna just like go with either the arts core or or 156 00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.659 Jenny Duan: or space, and just pick something specific in it. 157 00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.690 Jenny Duan: Okay, Hi, welcome back. What happened. 158 00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.247 huda s: Yeah, my, my computer, just like, just like, disconnected. 159 00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.580 Jenny Duan: Oh, your camera is also back. Now cool. 160 00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.340 huda s: Yes. 161 00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.450 Jenny Duan: Okay, did you get to hear what I said? Where did I cut off, or where did you disconnect. 162 00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:45.154 huda s: I couldn't if I didn't get to hear like the ideas yet. 163 00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:55.610 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I was. Gonna say, do you prefer me just like giving you more ideas? Or would you like to go deeper into something that you've already mentioned, cause I think, like both could be good. 164 00:27:56.449 --> 00:28:01.250 huda s: I think. Maybe like, if you give like, brand new ideas, cause? 165 00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.879 huda s: yeah, I guess those might be able. We can work with them a bit more. 166 00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.289 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so it has to be something in tech science or 167 00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:18.060 Jenny Duan: math. Within science. I think that things that are interesting to me are like. 168 00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.860 Jenny Duan: maybe like how 169 00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.130 Jenny Duan",
    ": how it 170 00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.170 Jenny Duan: actually 171 00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:34.350 Jenny Duan: what is something very specific. It's okay. Let's maybe choose a display. Biology, chemistry, physics, or math pick one. 172 00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.250 huda s: biology. 173 00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.120 Jenny Duan: Okay. 174 00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.118 Jenny Duan: biology. There's lots to talk about in biology. 175 00:28:46.060 --> 00:29:06.450 huda s: Oh, wait! I had an idea which isn't really biology, but like, so I saw a video like, if if we have like black holes. And why don't we just put trash in them to like to like, you know? Solve our trash issue trash pollution issue at Earth, and then maybe I could like debunk that and like, say, like, why, it wouldn't work. 176 00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.006 Jenny Duan: that's interesting. 177 00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.210 Jenny Duan: that's cool. 178 00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:23.720 Jenny Duan: I think something else that could be interesting are like writing about quantum mechanics in physics like a video about quantum mechanics. Maybe a video about like 179 00:29:24.341 --> 00:29:26.599 Jenny Duan: something about the brain like 180 00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:31.199 Jenny Duan: how how emotions are handled in the brain or like how your brain 181 00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.780 Jenny Duan: processes fear or like how memory works, how memory is stored, I think, is really interesting. 182 00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.855 Jenny Duan: maybe 183 00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.859 Jenny Duan: the study of molecular spectroscopy, like 184 00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:53.310 Jenny Duan: how molecules interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation. That's chemistry. But in physics. But that's a little bit interesting. 185 00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.850 Jenny Duan: biology. 186 00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.280 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 187 00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.540 Jenny Duan: maybe like. 188 00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.929 Jenny Duan: I",
    " think neuroscience is interesting within. 189 00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.310 huda s: Yeah. 190 00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.280 Jenny Duan: Biology. 191 00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:19.370 Jenny Duan: Like they like. How pound neurons fire like, how do they transmit information to? 192 00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.980 Jenny Duan: I think. 193 00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:24.460 Jenny Duan: like 194 00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.390 Jenny Duan: the heap. 195 00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.029 Jenny Duan: the citric acid cycle, or like the human 196 00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.389 Jenny Duan: metabolism system, is a little bit interesting. 197 00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.980 Jenny Duan: oh, like, maybe something about DNA, and like something related to like 198 00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.380 Jenny Duan: something related to DNA. That's a big topic, but like 199 00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.719 Jenny Duan: something related to DNA, could be cool. 200 00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:54.633 huda s: Yeah, I think DNA is also, I think, maybe my top 2 choices, or something about DNA or 201 00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.450 huda s: something about like the brain. 202 00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.639 huda s: And those 2 options are pretty interesting. 203 00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:06.219 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, so why don't you? Okay, what's out of those 2? What are? What's the one that you're most interested in? 204 00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.112 huda s: I think genetics might be more like interesting to write about 205 00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:24.570 huda s: or I mean, like, make a video about I think, cause there's like a lot we a lot of like different angles we can take or like ex things we can explain. So like, for example, like 206 00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.876 huda s: this isn't perfect, but like, maybe something like 207 00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:39.291 huda s: like how genetics like work, and like, why, why do you have, like a whole set of different genetics, and like your siblings, or something like that. 208 00:31:39.963 --",
    "> 00:31:47.079 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, so why don't we pick genetics, plus DNA slash like Rna slash all of that, and then go from there. 209 00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.080 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, maybe it's something. 210 00:31:50.700 --> 00:32:00.369 Jenny Duan: I don't know how many videos are made on this. But like you could be like, do you know that like we share 50 of a DNA, our DNA with a banana. I think that's still true. Yeah, I think that's true. 211 00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.149 huda s: Oh, wow! I didn't know that. 212 00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let me just verify. Let me just verify before I give you fake news. 213 00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.260 huda s: And go. 214 00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.710 Jenny Duan: Let me see. 215 00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.990 Jenny Duan: okay, no, 40%. We're 40%. No. 216 00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.119 huda s: A lot for a banana. 217 00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.969 Jenny Duan: Okay, wait. 218 00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.949 Jenny Duan: Okay. Apparently this is like a little bit contested 219 00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.660 Jenny Duan: own. 220 00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.619 Jenny Duan: wow, there's like people are arguing about this online. 221 00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.140 Jenny Duan: I'll 222 00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:44.420 Jenny Duan: I am. I'm sorry. I think I think in popular science it's said to be 50%. 223 00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:50.647 Jenny Duan: Some researchers debate whether it's 40% or 60%. That's like, that's the consensus. But 224 00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:57.660 Jenny Duan: yeah. So we share a significant amount of our DNA with the bananas. So I think DNA, video for the breakthrough challenge could be really 225 00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.720 Jenny Duan: good. 226 00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.270 Jenny Duan: okay. 227 00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:07.019 Jenny Duan: just just checking. Were you able to submit apple engineering camp? Do some of that yet? 228 00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.240 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. And the",
    "n for folklift, how's the new social media person 229 00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:15.170 Jenny Duan: and empowering AI like, how's the phasing out? Vp, going. 230 00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:29.604 huda s: Yeah. So so I made like a group chat with, like all the new officers and everything. And we were like planning for future events, and also, like I was updating like what their responsibilities are and everything. So 231 00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:55.840 huda s: so we're kind of like planning like on our social media like, how are we gonna kind of optimize it to have like a larger following? And I think the marketing director, I think she has like she has a lot of knowledge about it. So I suggested, like, Oh, how about we do like 1 one woman in tech every day or every week for like kind of like for highlighting and then she said that it doesn't do well in the SEO 232 00:33:56.133 --> 00:34:02.302 huda s: and so like it might be like wise to like, take post like in a different direction, and maybe like just 233 00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:16.699 huda s: like make more reels and everything and everyone just kind of agreed to be more consistent on like social media and everything. So we haven't started posting yet. But we've like she's been like preparing posts and everything. 234 00:34:17.685 --> 00:34:24.060 huda s: And then so the treasure started like doing the paperwork for the 5 one c. 235 00:34:24.776 --> 00:34:26.050 huda s: and then 236 00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:38.039 huda s: so I I kind of mentioned to the Vice President that like oh, Unfortunately, I feel like there's like a kind of lack of you know. Like 237 00:34:38.453 --> 00:34:53.199 huda s: like movement so far so I think I think we might need to speed it up, or else I might have to like Reorient, the organization. And so she's kind of just agreed, and I think, for now we're keeping her. But if she like. 238 00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:59.673 huda s: just does, this continues to not do anything. Then. I think we? I can remove ",
    "her, and it'll be fine. 239 00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.879 huda s: But yeah. 240 00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.941 huda s: and we're just trying to like 241 00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:22.220 huda s: we're just trying to like start posting more and also get our AI car competition like up and running. And so they're from like different districts, like all them. So then now I guess we can say that empowering eyes like across 5 districts. So I think that sounds pretty good. 242 00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:38.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. That's super exciting, like that's super exciting across 5 districts is awesome, I think. Like the more you try to get your geographic reach out the better because we could say, like, it's across 10 countries. We could say, it's across like 5 continents like it. These are. 243 00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:53.340 Jenny Duan: I call these like vanity metrics. What like? In reality, it doesn't really matter like whether or not your members are concentrated. I mean, it does matter. But like doesn't matter that much whether your members are concentrated within like a certain geographical area. But it just looks good. So it's like a vanity metric. 244 00:35:53.721 --> 00:35:59.330 Jenny Duan: To to have these things. So yeah, that's that's really awesome. Now, I kind of want to 245 00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:06.430 Jenny Duan: talk about camera impact. Were you able to make any progress on your application since we last talked. I know it's only been like 2 days, though. 246 00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:15.070 huda s: Yeah, I've been trying to work on that. Just that one essay. I feel like I'm struggling a lot with this application specifically because I kind of 247 00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:35.676 huda s: it's just kinda intimidating, and also like I can't think of like kind of how to start it off. So maybe like I can. I need like a little bit of framework, cause I was struggling. But I did for the essay where it talks about location of. I'm pretty much finished, I guess, b",
    "ut I still need to kind of wrap it up and 248 00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:48.889 huda s: connected back to myself. But yeah, and then I removed, like the part where talks about like moving to like a new city. Which we discussed last summer, trying not to send that kind of message out. 249 00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:59.339 Jenny Duan: Got it. Okay? So okay, that's that one, I say, seems like the bottom like, is there anything that I can help with that one? Or 250 00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.920 Jenny Duan: is it just like. 251 00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:02.720 huda s: Yeah. 252 00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.850 Jenny Duan: There anything I can do to help with that? Say. 253 00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:15.866 huda s: With this essay. So like I'm kind of I'm trying to like ended off and like, actually, do you think I'm not talking about like myself, in a sense, essay, or like. 254 00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.180 Jenny Duan: Let's look at it together. Let me go on to the 255 00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:20.969 Jenny Duan: Bucky plan. 256 00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.330 Jenny Duan: Oh, here. 257 00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:43.442 Jenny Duan: this one, right, the this one starting. 258 00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.540 huda s: Yeah. 259 00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.989 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's so symbolic. Starty valley and Silicon Valley, too. 260 00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.290 huda s: Oh, yeah. 261 00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:16.489 Jenny Duan: I think this is too much. This is too much like setting like description of, like what's happening in the game. 262 00:38:16.803 --> 00:38:19.810 Jenny Duan: I feel like there should be like 1, 2 paragraphs. Max. 263 00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.559 Jenny Duan: like this, this part, all of this. 264 00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.640 huda s: Okay. 265 00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.989 Jenny Duan: This can be condensed. I think it should be more about you. 266 00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:30.670 huda s: so 267 00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.950 huda s: I kind of. 268 00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:38.189 huda s: I",
    " kind of need this part where it talks about like Jojo, Mart, which is like 269 00:38:39.080 --> 00:39:00.588 huda s: the one like like one side of the, I guess, like choice where they have to choose between like opportunities, but, like, you know, isolated and not like part of a community. And then there's like, the community center, which is like beneficial to all. And it's just like building opportunities in in like the middle of nowhere. 270 00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:05.459 huda s: I guess. That's like kind of like the 2 sides. So I kind of. 271 00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:14.770 huda s: I feel like I have to contextualize it, but I don't know if I'm like doing it too much like. Can you like, say, like what things you think I should most remove. 272 00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.010 Jenny Duan: I think 273 00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:28.400 Jenny Duan: oh, hey! 274 00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:28.990 huda s: Clint. 275 00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.190 Jenny Duan: The the. The small rural town stuff can like 276 00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:36.629 Jenny Duan: could be put here before town like it can kind of just be shoved there. 277 00:39:39.663 --> 00:39:40.510 huda s: This part. 278 00:39:42.909 --> 00:39:47.519 Jenny Duan: No like any description, like any physical description of the town 279 00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.150 Jenny Duan: can be put here. 280 00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:58.979 huda s: Hmm! I think the reason why I put this like the like. The description about the community center was here was because like 281 00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.909 huda s: it was like the part would ask, like, make a decision? Between the 2, 282 00:40:06.361 --> 00:40:12.099 huda s: between the 2, like options of building the community Center or Georgia mark. 283 00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.460 Jenny Duan: Okay. 284 00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.839 Jenny Duan: see what else could be made? 285 00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:39.089 Jenny Duan: this is like too descriptive, like these 2 paragraphs, I think, basically say the ",
    "same thing. 286 00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.600 Jenny Duan: Like 287 00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.380 Jenny Duan: in different ways. I think you just choose one of these, and like cut it down 288 00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.330 Jenny Duan: in the moon. 289 00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.729 Jenny Duan: and I think you should give the character a name. 290 00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.400 huda s: Alright sounds good. 291 00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.489 Jenny Duan: This would just be like one sentence. I don't think you need all of this descriptive language here. 292 00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:17.369 Jenny Duan: You can even take down this entire paragraph. Because I feel like this says. 293 00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:24.869 Jenny Duan: like these 2, like the 2 paragraphs before. If you undo that, yeah, like these 2 paragraphs basically say the same thing. 294 00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:27.730 huda s: They sue. 295 00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.319 Jenny Duan: Right like it's all about the character like deciding whether or not they want to. 296 00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:41.709 Jenny Duan: take the leap, and, like, you know, change the life or or not. 297 00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:55.799 huda s: and I combine them. I feel like some imagery might be like 298 00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.600 huda s: like necessary for. 299 00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:04.710 Jenny Duan: Maybe keep one of the sentences from the imagery one, and then just confine them, and then delete one of their questions. 300 00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.995 huda s: Yeah, okay, I I think I kept this one. 301 00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.180 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. 302 00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:42.269 Jenny Duan: okay, I think other than that. I I think the beginning is still too long. But I 303 00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.470 Jenny Duan: I think this vine sentence can be deleted. 304 00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.909 huda s: So. No no imagery about the. 305 00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.980 Jenny Duan: I think it's okay. 306 00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.320 huda s: Alri",
    "ght! 307 00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:01.589 Jenny Duan: Maybe add here, like a little clause that's like something about the vines. 308 00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.639 huda s: Okay, let me just. 309 00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.963 Jenny Duan: I feel like this paragraph, and this paragraph could also be shortened because they all seem pretty similar to 310 00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.050 Jenny Duan: like. I don't think the reader cares that much about the game, like, I think. 311 00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:36.009 Jenny Duan: Unfortunately, they just want to hear about your life, too, in the in the game just provides context for your life. So I feel like that part. The detail about Starting Valley, while important, should be as short as possible. 312 00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.200 huda s: Really. 313 00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:45.270 huda s: But I wanna I wanna bring out like that 314 00:43:45.747 --> 00:43:53.780 huda s: like, maybe like, of course, need a short note. But I think, maybe, how do I be able to implement the fact that the the character kind of 315 00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.360 huda s: chose community over, like, you know, self 316 00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.400 huda s: growth. But in in like a way that doesn't really like 317 00:44:00.975 --> 00:44:10.440 huda s: show in a bad light, and also like I can set it up so that then I can start talking about myself, and like how I see myself in this game. 318 00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:12.290 Jenny Duan: Okay. 319 00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.910 Jenny Duan: I think 320 00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.100 Jenny Duan: a 321 00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:38.640 Jenny Duan: but the character man is somewhere out of nowhere. Maybe you could. Instead of saying this, you can say, like 322 00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.759 Jenny Duan: mountain House. California is my 323 00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.020 Jenny Duan: is my nowhere. 324 00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.329 Jenny Duan: but I've like spent my like 325 00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.529 Jenny Duan: you can say. 326 ",
    "00:44:51.690 --> 00:45:09.410 Jenny Duan: But I said my time like doing Xyz to transform it into like with the hopes of fully transforming it into a somewhere, but like something like that, like Mounthouse, California is like nowhere surrounded by the smell of manure every day. I 327 00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:18.320 Jenny Duan: like blank, blank, blank, blank, like whatever you do. And then you can say like, in time, like it will, it will become a somewhere or something like that. 328 00:45:20.557 --> 00:45:29.430 huda s: maybe like, through my efforts and those around me. We'll, be able to transform mountain house into somewhere. 329 00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's good. 330 00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:53.329 huda s: And then we I and then should we talk about? Should I talk about like a startup manure? Should? Is this where I talk about like my activities, like 331 00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.820 huda s: like things that I do to make progress better or. 332 00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:07.859 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like what your concrete effort and impact is like, I think, camera impact. They they really care about your effort and like what you've actually done. 333 00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.270 Jenny Duan: And so yeah, that's why. 334 00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.430 Jenny Duan: Okay. 335 00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:29.469 Jenny Duan: I think with the rest of this essay, I think once you like finish writing it, we can go back and edit, and it'll give it more shape. 336 00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:30.650 huda s: Yeah. 337 00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:35.779 huda s: also. For the other essays. I was hoping like, maybe 338 00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:43.830 huda s: we'd write like like a framework or some something like that, because I'm I'm kind of like stuck, and I I don't know how to start. 339 00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.160 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't, I think. Let's 340 00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:54.599 Jenny Duan: let's spend some time we meet next in like what? 2 days? One. No, ",
    "let me see, when our next meeting is 341 00:46:54.730 --> 00:47:02.250 Jenny Duan: yeah, 2 days to to do that, I think.
