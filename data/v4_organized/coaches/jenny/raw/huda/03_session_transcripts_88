How's it going. 3 00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.489 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 4 00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:00.350 Jenny Duan: Doing good. Nice to see you. Were you able to submit your Uc. Application? How did everything go there. 5 00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.550 huda: Yeah, I submitted this morning. 6 00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:09.779 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, congratulations! That's amazing. Super happy to hear that. I think 7 00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:20.290 Jenny Duan: today, let's finish up your mit essays. Have you been? Or let's take a look at them. I wouldn't say finish. Have you been able to make progress on those? And how's that going. 8 00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:33.289 huda: Yeah, I got 2 drafts for like, I mean, like for 2 of the essays. It's the one it's like the achieving the unexpected essay, and then also the 9 00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.019 huda: like diverse backgrounds, collaboration essay. 10 00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.309 Jenny Duan: Amazing. Let me take a look at those. 11 00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.139 Jenny Duan: How's your break been? What have you been up to since we last spoke? 12 00:09:03.947 --> 00:09:11.149 huda: It's been pretty well I've taken some time to relax as well, so that's been good. Had friendsgiving and everything. 13 00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.350 Jenny Duan: Amazing. 14 00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:26.200 Jenny Duan: Alright, achieving the unexpected is the 1st one. Let's focus on that. 15 00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:08.109 Jenny Duan: Can you describe why most people view you this way like, why do people view you that way? 16 00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:17.419 huda: Like before. I kind of had like an anecdote about like in a classroom, for example, like sitting in the back. Not exactly like 17 00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.580 huda: unless called on. I don't really talk in class and 18 00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.589 huda: yeah, just like in general, I'm like, a more shy and like quiet person. 19 00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.089 Jenny Duan: By the way, can you describe? Like 20 00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:49.840 Jenny Duan: I think we can emphasize? Why, it's unexpected here, because maybe you can say like, you're a Muslim girl. You're normally most people in class view you as like the quiet Muslim girl, or something like that like, give you. Give your not, give yourself a label, but I think emphasize why this is so unexpected. 21 00:10:51.869 --> 00:10:56.340 huda: maybe instead of like reserved one, then we can just say, reserved muslim girl. 22 00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.950 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's good. 23 00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.529 huda: Should like unexpected. I think it could be like strengthened if I say juxtapositional. 24 00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.429 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that works. 25 00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:44.080 Jenny Duan: And then I think here you don't have to say as a Muslim girl in the gaming world you can just like. Can you describe your identity in a different way? Because you already said that you were a Muslim girl? 26 00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.949 huda: We know that about you already here, like a different label or. 27 00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe. 28 00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.250 huda: I'm not sure 29 00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.809 Jenny Duan: Could you already see it now here, so we can change to something else here. 30 00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.860 huda: Like. I'm not sure, because, like I don't think there's any other way to say, like a Muslim girl. 31 00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.919 Jenny Duan: Like. Instead of saying that you're a Muslim girl, can you say like you're different? Like as 32 00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:33.639 Jenny Duan: I don't know someone different, or as and use a different way to emphasize the difference. Because you already explained like, why you're different. So I don't think we need to say like the same phrasing. If there's another thing, an alternative here. 33 00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.460 huda: Maybe like a pariah. 34 00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.710 Jenny Duan: What are the connotations of pariah? 35 00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah, as a pariah? Sure. 36 00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.760 Jenny Duan: Have you ever experienced discrimination in like voice, chat, or other? 37 00:12:57.088 --> 00:12:59.559 Jenny Duan: Can you write a little bit about that? 38 00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.510 huda: I don't know if I should like like 39 00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:13.040 huda: I mean, for example, there, there have been times where like people like see my name and they'll say stuff like like mocking the religion like 40 00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.020 huda: that's true. Here. 41 00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.499 Jenny Duan: You can see that here, like the sometimes, and like sometimes 42 00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.880 Jenny Duan: blatant discrimination in voice chats, or something like that, to emphasize. 43 00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.870 huda: Okay. 44 00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:39.610 Jenny Duan: Okay. 45 00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.730 Jenny Duan: Is there a more descriptive way to say played out. 46 00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:03.770 huda: maybe like like stereotypes yelled at me in voice. Chats. 47 00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:13.629 Jenny Duan: Is there a way we can use stronger or more specific diction expressed in voice chats? Maybe. 48 00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.830 huda: Yeah, stereotypes. 49 00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.860 huda: would it? Would it make sense to just say, like stereotypes yelled through voice, Chats! 50 00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.510 Jenny Duan: Yelled, yelled us good! 51 00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:54.340 Jenny Duan: I think here this sentence makes it feel like the focus is not on you anymore. 52 00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.680 Jenny Duan: Can you put the focus back on yourself? 53 00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:31.329 huda: Maybe, should I say something like like I leverage my game development to reshape the industry's landscape. 54 00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's great. 55 00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.010 Jenny Duan: Still interesting to see. 56 00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.239 Jenny Duan: Can you add a little bit more detail to this 1st sentence? What does your room look like and 57 00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.960 Jenny Duan: like, can you? I think let's make it a little bit. Not that it's generic, but let's make it a little bit more specific 58 00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.630 Jenny Duan: to you like, what does your room look like? 59 00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.499 Jenny Duan: How does it feel to be in it? Yeah. 60 00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:07.459 huda: Maybe like to add, like a kind of gaming reference I could put like WA. Sd. 61 00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.160 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be good. 62 00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.320 huda: Maybe insert like poster cloud. Should I use this as an opportunity to like 63 00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.700 huda: kind of show my Muslim identity more maybe. 64 00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.079 Jenny Duan: And what does that look like for you? Or how would you do that? 65 00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.409 huda: Like 66 00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.350 huda: Maybe like I can talk about like like a painting of the Kabba that I have. 67 00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.590 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. 68 00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.240 huda: Or do you think like that's not necessary? Because. 69 00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.280 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's necessary, but I think you should be more specific about like 70 00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.970 Jenny Duan: what posters you have or what color your monitor is. 71 00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.520 huda: My warm. 72 00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.229 Jenny Duan: Poster clad bedroom. Is it just my, what color is your headset? 73 00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:31.349 Jenny Duan: I feel like the I think this doesn't add detail. The wasd keys doesn't add detail about you. 74 00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.919 Jenny Duan: because, like, of course, gamers use those keys. But like. 75 00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:44.460 Jenny Duan: what is something specific. For example, if you said hovered over your pink like 76 00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:53.030 Jenny Duan: keyboard cover. That would be specific to you. But Wasd, kids are not exactly specific to you. 77 00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.350 Jenny Duan: great 78 00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:22.400 Jenny Duan: like, are you into keyboards? A lot of people are really into keyboards. Is that something that you're interested in? Or do you click, collect keyboards or play with your keyboard caps? 79 00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.110 Jenny Duan: It's fine. If you don't just. 80 00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.640 huda: Really. 81 00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.950 Jenny Duan: No. Okay. Great. 82 00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.359 Jenny Duan: Hmm, what does pink, white keyboard mean? Is it like pink and white or. 83 00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:33.920 huda: Yeah. 84 00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.279 Jenny Duan: Okay, can you? Maybe it would be more clear to just write pink and white keyboard. 85 00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.329 huda: Maybe, like another way, I can like word it. 86 00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.050 huda: I paste in like another way. I can word it. 87 00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.340 Jenny Duan: Okay. 88 00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:25.630 huda: I don't know if this this makes a lot of sense in the context of gaming. 89 00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.599 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's great. 90 00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:36.490 huda: Okay. 91 00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:44.919 Jenny Duan: And then can we contextualize this more? Like most most people at school, most most like, where what type of people see you this way 92 00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:51.159 Jenny Duan: like maybe you could say like, outside my close friends, or like most people at school, you can say 93 00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.420 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 94 00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.170 huda: Most strangers. 95 00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:04.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, most maybe you can say, like most strangers, instantly categorize me or instantly perceive me as. 96 00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.021 huda: Or I don't know if I wanna 97 00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:38.899 huda: like cause I want to kind of make it so that it looks like like people at school who kind of like roughly know who I am and like my behavior outside of like video games. They think that I'm like timid but cause like I'm afraid that if I add this, that like, it's like the instant like categorization, just kind of means like my appearance just looks like that 98 00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:49.827 huda: but like, if you get to know me, I'm not. But the the thing that I'm trying to say is that even like people who don't know me, or people that do know me. Just think I'm a little 99 00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.280 huda: like quieter. But like, when I'm on video games, it's like completely different. 100 00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:00.260 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, maybe you can just say most people. 101 00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.309 Jenny Duan: no, maybe you can say most people know me as 102 00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.589 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine. If you say most people know me as, or most people perceive me as. 103 00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:26.640 huda: Or if I still want to contextualize it, I can still say most people from school. 104 00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 105 00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:39.340 Jenny Duan: that I think that would be good, because it's like, who are these people like? Does your family think that? No, probably like? Do your friends think that? No, but like who thinks that? Okay. 106 00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.650 Jenny Duan: Why is this part relevant. 107 00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:52.310 huda: I think I was just like adding in like another like kind of example of like quietness. 108 00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.370 Jenny Duan: Go ahead. 109 00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:05.400 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think I'm being super nitpicky. But I feel like this last part. 110 00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.050 huda: Hmm. 111 00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:11.539 Jenny Duan: Be a little bit different, because, this is emphasizing your 112 00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:27.400 Jenny Duan: educational journeys. So I guess, like this part doesn't really add any new information, and with an essay this short, you want every sentence or every phrase to add new information. So I'm curious, like, what's next in your education journey that you can emphasize. 113 00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.109 huda: Maybe like continuing to build like games for social change. 114 00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:46.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and every line of code, every girl I mentor and every boundary I push, maybe like 115 00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.710 Jenny Duan: inspires me to 116 00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.630 Jenny Duan: into your building, because. 117 00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:10.070 huda: I was actually wondering if I should like replace this last bit like the most powerful stories come from unexpected places, because it kind of sounds like, I'm like 118 00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.540 huda: kind of like tooting my own horn and saying that, like, I like a really like most powerful story. 119 00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:25.010 Jenny Duan: Building, because I think this should be like something that points to your future, or what you your hopes for, the how the industry 120 00:27:26.076 --> 00:27:27.410 Jenny Duan: and change 121 00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.279 Jenny Duan: and to continue building. Because 122 00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:01.820 Jenny Duan: and this is emphasizing like, okay, let's look at what parts of the prompt you've already answered, achieving the unexpected. 123 00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.210 Jenny Duan: I've done that here. 124 00:28:05.653 --> 00:28:12.840 Jenny Duan: What was you've done? Something different. So emphasizing the difference that's here. 125 00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.610 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 126 00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:25.020 Jenny Duan: Can you complete the sentence with like, I guess the lesson that you've learned, if anything, from what you've built. 127 00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:28.700 huda: From like my projects. 128 00:28:30.646 --> 00:28:34.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, or from your own journey as a builder or as a computer scientist. 129 00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.830 huda: like, I don't know if if this should be like 130 00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.530 huda: like because this like because it 131 00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:06.509 huda: shut because the timid and the underrepresented, or I mean like not in those terms like verbatim, but like 132 00:29:07.196 --> 00:29:10.270 huda: kind of like. The point, I'm trying to say is like that. 133 00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:29.020 huda: like the people like me, who are not really represented like the shy and like the underrepresented people. And like the video game industry, they have, like a great potential as well is that I don't know if that's like kind of oh, I guess that kind of detracts from like me. I guess I don't think that really focuses too much on me. 134 00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.450 huda: Hmm! 135 00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.400 huda: Maybe if it's I don't know, this might sound a little flowery. 136 00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:47.869 huda: But one could be like, because the power because the power 137 00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:53.840 huda: to transform an industry lies in the hands of those willing to challenge its boundaries. 138 00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.460 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 139 00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.369 huda: That sounds a little flowery. I feel. 140 00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:06.030 Jenny Duan: I think that does sound a little bit vague. If we could be a little more specific inspires me to continue building. Because. 141 00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.260 Jenny Duan: What would you like want? How do you see your journey? Continuing to evolve. 142 00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:24.350 huda: Like, I think I'll continue to develop games. And then specifically, creating more projects, maybe like 143 00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:35.200 huda: even having like with the people that I mentor through like women in games like working with them to create video games, with, like our perspectives. 144 00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:44.889 huda: So like continuing like to build projects, for like games that deliver a social change, meaning maybe. 145 00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.500 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 146 00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.920 Jenny Duan: Oh, see here. 147 00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.020 Jenny Duan: and. 148 00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:09.149 huda: Oh, I think I there's like this idea. 149 00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:20.489 huda: because the future of gaming isn't about fitting in. It's about standing out and creating spaces where everyone can level up. 150 00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.910 Jenny Duan: I like this I like. I think this is good. Which which essay is this?

I think it sounds good. 159 00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.290 Jenny Duan: be they. 160 00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.759 huda: Oh, one word. 161 00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.650 huda: maybe, like artificial consciousness, I can just say, AI. 162 00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.540 Jenny Duan: I like artificial consciousness. 163 00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.670 Jenny Duan: I think here. 164 00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.180 huda: Before could you say? Before speaking. 165 00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:18.460 Jenny Duan: Okay. 166 00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:29.179 Jenny Duan: okay, this sounds. This looks good. Can you read it out loud? One more time. 167 00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:39.990 huda: Click, click! Whoosh! In my poster clad bedroom, bathed in the soft glow of monitors. My fingers dance across a pink white keyboard as I adjust my headset. 168 00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:46.140 huda: Most people from school know me as a reserved Muslim girl, a quiet thinker who processes before speaking. 169 00:34:46.230 --> 00:35:00.560 huda: But in this digital realm I transform into something juxtapositional, a warrior, a strategist, a creator. While my mother prepares Biryani downstairs for eth tomorrow I'm coordinating raid strategies in final fantasy. 170 00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:17.939 huda: 6 or executing perfect speed runs in portal. Gaming isn't just a pastime. It's where I discovered my voice as a pariah in the gaming world. I noticed the raised eyebrows. The stereotypes yelled through voice chats, and the subtle assumptions about what my interests should be. 171 00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:28.330 huda: But those assumptions only fueled my determination. I channeled my passion into creating synthoria, a game that explores the ethical implications of AI through an immersive narrative. 172 00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:35.390 huda: Players navigate complex moral choices while driving the humanity within artificial consciousness 173 00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.669 huda: now as an ambassador for women in gaming. 174 00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.110 huda: I mentor other girls who, like me, didn't fit the typical gamer mold. 175 00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:48.069 huda: I leverage my game development to reshape the industry's landscape. 176 00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:58.729 huda: Every line of code I write, every girl I mentor, and every boundary I push inspires me to continue building because the future of gaming is about creating spaces where everyone can level up. 177 00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.970 Jenny Duan: I think it looks really great. How are you feeling about these. 178 00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:12.079 huda: Yeah, I think. I don't know. Here it says the typical gamer mold. Should I? 179 00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:16.330 huda: Keep it as typical gamer or typical game developer. 180 00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:32.260 Jenny Duan: I think if you say game development here, you don't need to say game developer here. 181 00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.889 Jenny Duan: But what was the other thing that you recommended, or that you thought about. 182 00:36:37.476 --> 00:36:43.700 huda: I just changed here. Women in it went from women in gaming, so I changed it to women in games. 183 00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:47.435 Jenny Duan: Alright. 184 00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:52.929 Jenny Duan: I feel like this looks good. What would what did you want to change? Typical gamer to. 185 00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.710 huda: Oh, oh, the typical game developer. 186 00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:58.020 huda: Okay? 187 00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.560 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think it's fine, because you already say game development in the next sentence. So. 188 00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:03.550 huda: Beautiful. 189 00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.779 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine. 190 00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.310 huda: Okay. Then. 191 00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.310 Jenny Duan: Great 192 00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:19.269 Jenny Duan: In that case I feel like this is good. How do you feel about this essay? I think it's ready to go. 193 00:37:20.344 --> 00:37:23.910 huda: Then I think I think that's I like it as. 194 00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.253 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 195 00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:32.160 Jenny Duan: Now, let's go to the next essay. 196 00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.190 Jenny Duan: Need to cut. Okay. 197 00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.739 Jenny Duan: this is really good. I feel like it hits the nail with the prompt. 198 00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.460 huda: Thanks. 199 00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:15.420 huda: Also, I don't know if this tech bubble privilege, like the wording, is like off. 200 00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.000 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine. 201 00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.869 Jenny Duan: What was it like? Made Back Island Vibe. 202 00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.639 Jenny Duan: I forget. I can't forget. 203 00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.560 huda: Stuck. 204 00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.360 huda: Let me see. 205 00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.929 Jenny Duan: Energy of her head laid back, energy. 206 00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.910 huda: Yes, sleep. 207 00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.810 huda: Yeah. Just carrying the laid back energy from hometown. 208 00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:51.069 huda: Should I just not mention California here? Back in my small town? Yeah. 209 00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.440 huda: maybe, should I get rid of the instead of weaving, instead of pushing my own angle. 210 00:41:50.830 --> 00:42:01.550 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it's a little bit yeah competitive. There, it's 5 words. 211 00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:08.690 huda: Oh, can it? Can I just be like Silicone Dash valley. 212 00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:12.134 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's fine. 213 00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.120 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's it's done. 214 00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.680 huda: Oh, okay. 215 00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:41.439 Jenny Duan: Like I mean with the word count. 216 00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.070 Jenny Duan: Can you read it out loud. 217 00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:58.390 huda: Yeah. 218 00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:20.880 huda: look, these rent prices are criminal, I insisted, tapping my pencil against a crumpled statistic sheet in the J. Camp newsroom. But the political gridlock is the real story here, countered my Palo alto colleague, fresh from his Silicon Valley internship. At the same time our laid-back Maui teammate gestured emphatically about displaced communities and racial tensions. 219 00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:35.469 huda: The Austin summer heat mirrored our debate, each of us, armed with our lived experiences, dug deeper, I thought about the empty storefronts back in my small town, while they drew from their vastly different worlds tech bubble privilege and the island community wisdom. 220 00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.250 huda: Then something clicked. During our interview 221 00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:44.819 huda: I watched my politically minded teammate's expression shift as a homeless veteran shared his story. 222 00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:53.290 huda: Our Hawaiian colleagues, questions about gentrification sparked unexpected revelations about property, taxes, my my 223 00:43:53.460 --> 00:44:13.479 huda: affordable housing angle wove naturally through every conversations. We spent hours in the newsroom, piecing interviews together, listening to my teammates. Recordings. I began connecting seemingly unrelated dots. How a city council policy affected small business owners, how housing prices influence community displacement. 224 00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:32.469 huda: I work to weave our different perspectives into a cohesive narrative. What started as 3 competing stories became a nuanced investigation into Austin's interconnected challenges. Effective collaboration isn't about compromising your viewpoint. It's about using different perspectives to uncover deeper truths that none of us would have found alone. 225 00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.539 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think this is great. What do you think. 226 00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.389 huda: Yeah, I really like this one, too. 227 00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:49.380 Jenny Duan: Awesome. And then, did you get to make changes to? This one essay 6. 228 00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.090 Jenny Duan: Manage a situation so that you didn't expect what. 229 00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:57.680 huda: I have. I haven't made any changes yet. 230 00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.120 Jenny Duan: Okay, no problem. 231 00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:07.280 Jenny Duan: Oh, and then see 1, 2, 3, 232 00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:12.009 Jenny Duan: and then for the field of why this field of study, how do you feel about this essay? 233 00:45:13.061 --> 00:45:14.770 huda: Is it just like like 234 00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:20.609 huda: with this one? Am I supposed to talk more cause? I think I don't have the space to talk about like? 235 00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.220 huda: Why, I would 236 00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:30.949 huda: fit well into this project onto this major but like, so is this one where I talk about like details from the major. 237 00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.470 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and like, maybe what you want to pursue. 238 00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:38.479 huda: So like, would this be like clubs and stuff like that, too? 239 00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.439 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 240 00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:48.759 Jenny Duan: But I think it's more just, I think, focusing on the scope of just the major itself and not clubs, because I just don't think you have that much time. 241 00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:53.530 huda: Yeah, should I mention like specific classes that I might take. 242 00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:54.999 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be good. 243 00:45:57.546 --> 00:45:59.079 Jenny Duan: And then 244 00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:05.819 Jenny Duan: I think it's just like straightforward, like, what classes you want to do. Why is the major itself interesting. So like the research opportunities 245 00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:07.599 Jenny Duan: and other things. 246 00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.219 huda: Okay, got it? 247 00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.713 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing 248 00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:20.409 Jenny Duan: And then I think our next thing was to brainstorm Upenn essays. Do you have a doc for those. 249 00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:22.059 huda: No, I'm gonna make one. 250 00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.290 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 251 00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.030 huda: Oh, Ashley already had one! Never mind. 252 00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.830 Jenny Duan: Okay. 253 00:46:51.631 --> 00:46:52.989 huda: Let me delete this one. 254 00:47:07.093 --> 00:47:09.279 huda: I I just shared a new one with you. 255 00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.160 Jenny Duan: Alright. Thank you. 256 00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:19.039 huda: I think I think like with the Upenn they have. This like Major, which is the Dmd, which is digital media design. 257 00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, my friends, that major. It's pretty cool. 258 00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.769 huda: Yeah, I think that's the closest to like. 259 00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:29.090 huda: I think that was like the one that I chose for my 1st choice, major. So yeah. 260 00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:45.500 Jenny Duan: Is that one like how how art is that major versus like. 261 00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:52.520 Jenny Duan: I don't know what in what context digital media follows. But, like my friend takes a lot of fine arts classes. I don't know if that's. 262 00:47:54.136 --> 00:47:59.969 huda: It's a Bse, so it's still like science, engineering and science 263 00:48:00.467 --> 00:48:08.960 huda: and then it like there are some courses for like fine arts like like 264 00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:27.929 huda: art animation. But like, another aspect to the program is about like computer graphics, virtual reality environments, mathematics, computer programming. So I think it's like there's probably like concentrations, or like paths that you can take, depending on which one. 265 00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:30.260 Jenny Duan: Alright sounds? Good? 266 00:48:33.354 --> 00:48:39.439 Jenny Duan: Well, this is these are such interesting questions. Are these the only questions. 267 00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.899 huda: Let me just double check. 268 00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:49.500 Jenny Duan: This is so so interesting. Okay, not not expect this. 269 00:48:51.308 --> 00:48:53.500 huda: Yeah, I think that's it. 270 00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.819 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's interesting. 271 00:48:57.361 --> 00:49:04.000 Jenny Duan: Okay, well, the the this question, number 3. 0, this question, yeah. The 3rd question is just a typical like. 272 00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:09.301 Jenny Duan: why, Major, Essay, I think you can. I think you can handle this on your own? 273 00:49:10.202 --> 00:49:13.969 Jenny Duan: actually, do you have any specific questions about the 3rd question. 274 00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:16.990 huda: Okay, wait. So there's kind of a 275 00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.759 huda: 2 of the same kind, like for example, this one is 276 00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:31.710 huda: how you plan to pursue engineering interest at Penn. And then this one's like, like, specifically this measure. 277 00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:37.920 huda: So like how do I write like different essays for both of them. 278 00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.179 huda: So I think it's separate. 279 00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.780 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, I didn't even see it. 280 00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.989 Jenny Duan: Okay, is this a part of this question? 281 00:49:47.302 --> 00:49:49.800 huda: I think it's part of this upper question. 282 00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.410 Jenny Duan: Okay. 283 00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.959 huda: Or let me just double check. 284 00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.540 huda: Yeah, it's part of the upper question. 285 00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:03.780 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is more like, this question is more like, how like. 286 00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.309 Jenny Duan: actually, I think this is more the why. 287 00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:18.696 Jenny Duan: okay, if Y major is like a question. This is this, is this question is more like the major. And this question is more like the why, if that makes sense so in this question. You should talk about here. 288 00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.590 Jenny Duan: what classes 289 00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:32.970 Jenny Duan: at Penn, clubs, at Penn, organizations, etc. So this is just like how how you see yourself pursuing engineering at Penn. 290 00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.029 huda: And this one is. 291 00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:36.620 Jenny Duan: Why 292 00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:44.389 Jenny Duan: game development. They have your common app. So make sure not to overlap too much with that, or why digital media 293 00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:52.920 Jenny Duan: in design. So this one is like the process of being a creative and why creativity 294 00:50:53.230 --> 00:51:00.610 Jenny Duan: is important to you and like, maybe, why are interdisciplinary studies 295 00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:05.899 Jenny Duan: important to you? So answer those types of questions. 296 00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.440 huda: Hmm. 297 00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:13.290 huda: okay, that makes sense. And also it says, like, there's a 6 50 word limit. So should I write like 298 00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:19.159 huda: fully 6 50, cause that's like a whole this whole size of like a common app essay. So 299 00:51:19.803 --> 00:51:22.529 huda: or should I read something like a little smaller. 300 00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.769 Jenny Duan: I think you should just write like 301 00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:34.609 Jenny Duan: I think, anything within that range, like, I think, about 550 at least, or 600 essays is good. This is basically asking you for another common app. 302 00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.269 Jenny Duan: which is insane, like 6 50 words, is a common app right. 303 00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:44.450 huda: Wait. Let me see. Cause I think some of the colleges didn't require like the common up essay like 304 00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.140 huda: fun. 305 00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.690 huda: Let's see. 306 00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:51.969 huda: Oh, yeah. Upenn did require. But. 307 00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:54.139 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like you can. 308 00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:57.240 huda: Didn't require the essay. 309 00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.210 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 310 00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.980 Jenny Duan: Oh. 311 00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:09.270 Jenny Duan: hey? 312 00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:15.240 huda: Actually, brown has a really similar one for number one. 313 00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.090 Jenny Duan: Really what is what is brand. 314 00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:21.409 huda: It's actually the same same thing. It's like, Write a Thank you. Note, or 315 00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.669 huda: what was it? Let me see if the. 316 00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:27.220 Jenny Duan: Brown also makes you get a peer letter of recommendation right? 317 00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.521 huda: Really okay. I didn't. I didn't see that. 318 00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:33.229 Jenny Duan: I think. Well, they used to. I don't know if they still do, but 319 00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:38.650 Jenny Duan: actually no, Dartmouth makes you do a peer letter. I think Brown makes you do a video right? 320 00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.770 huda: Yeah, and Uchicago, I think. 321 00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.250 Jenny Duan: Wow, okay, 322 00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.080 Jenny Duan: okay, let me see. 323 00:52:58.570 --> 00:52:59.980 Jenny Duan: What? So what do you? 324 00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:05.619 Jenny Duan: What do you think you want to share about your creativity or your passion. That kind of differs from your common app statement. 325 00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:07.860 huda: Hmm! 326 00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.950 huda: I think 327 00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.610 huda: I think like I can use aspects of like 328 00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:32.649 huda: kind of previous common up essay drafts that I had which were like talking about like, kind of okay. Actually, this might be too like 329 00:53:33.446 --> 00:53:43.143 huda: unrelated. But just just like, put it out there. Like, kind of being like someone who is kind of in between a bunch of identities and like 330 00:53:43.670 --> 00:54:10.200 huda: and having like studying something that's like really is interdisciplinary. It's kind of I'm used to utilizing like not utilizing, like having, like these different sides of me, that kind of make me who I am. And then also like when I'm gaming and like when I'm like coding or like when I'm doing art. But I'm also writing algorithms like like in that way, I'm really used to like 331 00:54:10.755 --> 00:54:22.150 huda: using having like 2 identities, and also like using 2 identities to create something. So maybe like that could be like a good like approach to it, but I'm not sure if that's too like 332 00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.449 huda: not what they're looking for. It might be too philosophical or something. 333 00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:32.999 Jenny Duan: Oh, I don't think that that's too philosophical. Let me look at the 334 00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.360 Jenny Duan: let me look at the major and what it is about 335 00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.930 Jenny Duan: computer graphics and fine arts. 336 00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.090 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is perfect for you. 337 00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.840 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could talk about what you like about games. 338 00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:09.799 Jenny Duan: common app, like, if you can start by an analogy of like your favorite game that you've ever played 339 00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:19.849 Jenny Duan: and why that's and like, why, your favorite game is your favorite game. 340 00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:22.840 huda: Hmm, yeah. 341 00:55:23.557 --> 00:55:29.970 huda: Let me see. Actually wait. So you said you had a friend who has this major. 342 00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:37.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I do have a friend. Who is this, Major? But she's like, always been an artist like she did art competitions and things in high school. 343 00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.570 huda: Oh, 344 00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.719 huda: Is it possible? If I can read her essay. 345 00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:48.679 Jenny Duan: I can. I I can read her. 346 00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:58.189 Jenny Duan: I can ask, but I I haven't read her essay, so I'm not sure if she would be open. Let's see if we can find an essay online.

They're explaining how to approach the essay. So. 350 00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.919 Jenny Duan: You need a portfolio for for digital media design. 351 00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:46.950 Jenny Duan: Cause. That's 1 thing. It's like. 352 00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.099 huda: Let me double check. 353 00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.490 Jenny Duan: If you don't have a portfolio 354 00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:37.870 huda: No, it doesn't look.

That is 371 00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:22.409 Jenny Duan: I think you should still submit a portfolio and show your games. Cause. I think those are really valuable. 372 00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:31.750 huda: wait. It doesn't have any space for that in the common app. Maybe it's on the website after you submit. It. 373 00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:33.919 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe you'll get like a link. 374 00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.100 Jenny Duan: Okay? 375 00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:01.220 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think you should.

And you have those examples. 377 01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:18.850 Jenny Duan: Okay?

    "in class and 18 00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.589 huda: yeah, just like in general, I'm like, a more shy and like quiet person. 19 00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.089 Jenny Duan: By the way, can you describe? Like 20 00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:49.840 Jenny Duan: I think we can emphasize? Why, it's unexpected here, because maybe you can say like, you're a Muslim girl. You're normally most people in class view you as like the quiet Muslim girl, or something like that like, give you. Give your not, give yourself a label, but I think emphasize why this is so unexpected. 21 00:10:51.869 --> 00:10:56.340 huda: maybe instead of like reserved one, then we can just say, reserved muslim girl. 22 00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.950 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's good. 23 00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.529 huda: Should like unexpected. I think it could be like strengthened if I say juxtapositional. 24 00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.429 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that works. 25 00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:44.080 Jenny Duan: And then I think here you don't have to say as a Muslim girl in the gaming world you can just like. Can you describe your identity in a different way? Because you already said that you were a Muslim girl? 26 00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.949 huda: We know that about you already here, like a different label or. 27 00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe. 28 00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.250 huda: I'm not sure 29 00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.809 Jenny Duan: Could you already see it now here, so we can change to something else here. 30 00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.860 huda: Like. I'm not sure, because, like I don't think there's any other way to say, like a Muslim girl. 31 00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.919 Jenny Duan: Like. Instead of saying that you're a Muslim girl, can you say like you're different? Like as 32 00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:33.639 Jenny Duan: I don't know someone different, or as and use a different way to emphasize the difference. Because you already explained like, why you're different. So I don't thi",
    "nk we need to say like the same phrasing. If there's another thing, an alternative here. 33 00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.460 huda: Maybe like a pariah. 34 00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.710 Jenny Duan: What are the connotations of pariah? 35 00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah, as a pariah? Sure. 36 00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.760 Jenny Duan: Have you ever experienced discrimination in like voice, chat, or other? 37 00:12:57.088 --> 00:12:59.559 Jenny Duan: Can you write a little bit about that? 38 00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.510 huda: I don't know if I should like like 39 00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:13.040 huda: I mean, for example, there, there have been times where like people like see my name and they'll say stuff like like mocking the religion like 40 00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.020 huda: that's true. Here. 41 00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.499 Jenny Duan: You can see that here, like the sometimes, and like sometimes 42 00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.880 Jenny Duan: blatant discrimination in voice chats, or something like that, to emphasize. 43 00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.870 huda: Okay. 44 00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:39.610 Jenny Duan: Okay. 45 00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.730 Jenny Duan: Is there a more descriptive way to say played out. 46 00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:03.770 huda: maybe like like stereotypes yelled at me in voice. Chats. 47 00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:13.629 Jenny Duan: Is there a way we can use stronger or more specific diction expressed in voice chats? Maybe. 48 00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.830 huda: Yeah, stereotypes. 49 00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.860 huda: would it? Would it make sense to just say, like stereotypes yelled through voice, Chats! 50 00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.510 Jenny Duan: Yelled, yelled us good! 51 00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:54.340 Jenny Duan: I think here this sentence makes it feel like the focus is not on you anymore. 52 00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.680 Jenny Duan: Can you put the focus back on yourself? 53 00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:31.329 huda: Maybe, should I say somet",

What does your room look like and 57 00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.960 Jenny Duan: like, can you? I think let's make it a little bit. Not that it's generic, but let's make it a little bit more specific 58 00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.630 Jenny Duan: to you like, what does your room look like? 59 00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.499 Jenny Duan: How does it feel to be in it? Yeah. 60 00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:07.459 huda: Maybe like to add, like a kind of gaming reference I could put like WA. Sd. 61 00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.160 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be good. 62 00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.320 huda: Maybe insert like poster cloud. Should I use this as an opportunity to like 63 00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.700 huda: kind of show my Muslim identity more maybe. 64 00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.079 Jenny Duan: And what does that look like for you? Or how would you do that? 65 00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.409 huda: Like 66 00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.350 huda: Maybe like I can talk about like like a painting of the Kabba that I have. 67 00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.590 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. 68 00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.240 huda: Or do you think like that's not necessary? Because. 69 00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.280 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's necessary, but I think you should be more specific about like 70 00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.970 Jenny Duan: what posters you have or what color your monitor is. 71 00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.520 huda: My warm. 72 00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.229 Jenny Duan: Poster clad bedroom. Is it just my, what color is your headset? 73 00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:31.349 Jenny Duan: I feel like the I think this doesn't add detail. The wasd keys doesn't ad",
    "d detail about you. 74 00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.919 Jenny Duan: because, like, of course, gamers use those keys. But like. 75 00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:44.460 Jenny Duan: what is something specific. For example, if you said hovered over your pink like 76 00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:53.030 Jenny Duan: keyboard cover. That would be specific to you. But Wasd, kids are not exactly specific to you. 77 00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.350 Jenny Duan: great 78 00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:22.400 Jenny Duan: like, are you into keyboards? A lot of people are really into keyboards. Is that something that you're interested in?

Maybe it would be more clear to just write pink and white keyboard. 85 00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.329 huda: Maybe, like another way, I can like word it. 86 00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.050 huda: I paste in like another way.

Like most most people at school, most most like, where what type of people see you this way 92 00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:51.159 Jenny Duan: like maybe you could say like, outside my close friends, or like most people at school, you can say 93 00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.420 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 94 00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.170",

They think that I'm like timid but cause like I'm afraid that if I add this, that like, it's like the instant like categorization, just kind of means like my appearance just looks like that 98 00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:49.827 huda: but like, if you get to know me, I'm not. But the the thing that I'm trying to say is that even like people who don't know me, or people that do know me. Just think I'm a little 99 00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.280 huda: like quieter. But like, when I'm on video games, it's like completely different. 100 00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:00.260 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, maybe you can just say most people. 101 00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.309 Jenny Duan: no, maybe you can say most people know me as 102 00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.589 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine. If you say most people know me as, or most people perceive me as. 103 00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:26.640 huda: Or if I still want to contextualize it, I can still say most people from school. 104 00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 105 00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:39.340 Jenny Duan: that I think that would be good, because it's like, who are these people like? Does your family think that? No, probably like? Do your friends think that? No, but like who thinks that? Okay. 106 00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.650 Jenny Duan: Why is this part relevant. 107 00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:52.310 huda: I think I was just like adding in like another like kind of example of like quietness. 108 00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.370 Jenny Duan: Go ahead. 109 00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:05.400 Jenny Duan: ",

Women in it went from women in gaming, so I changed it to women in games. 183 00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:47.435 Jenny Duan: Alright. 184 00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:52.929 Jenny Duan: I feel like this looks good.

How a city council policy affected small business owners, how housing prices influence community displacement. 224 00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:32.469 huda: I work to weave our different perspectives into a cohesive narrative. What started as 3 competing stories became a nuanced investigation into Austin's interconnected challenges. Effective collaboration isn't about compromising your viewpoint. It's about using different perspectives to uncover deeper truths that none of us would have found alone. 225 00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.539 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think this is great.

Why is the major itself interesting. So like the research opportunities 245 00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:07.599 Jenny Duan: and other things. 246 00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.219 huda: Okay, got it? 247 00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.713 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing 248 00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:20.409 Jenny Duan: And then I think our next thing was to brainstorm Upenn essays.

This like Major, which is the Dmd, which is digital media design. 257 00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, my friends, that major. It's pretty cool. 258 00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.769 huda: Yeah, I think that's the closest to like. 259 00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:29.090 huda: I think that was like the one that I chose for my 1st choice, major. So yeah. 260 00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:45.500 Jenny Duan: Is that one like how how art is that major versus like. 261 00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:52.520 Jenny Duan: I don't know what in what context digital media follows. But, like my friend takes a lot of fine arts classes. I don't know if that's. 262 00:47:54.136 --> 00:47:59.969 huda: It's a Bse, so it's still like science, engineering and science 263 00:48:00.467 --> 00:48:08.960 huda: and then it like there are some courses for like fine arts like like 264 00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:27.929 huda: art animation. But like, another aspect to the program is about like computer graphics, virtual reality environments, mathematics, computer programming. So I think it's like there's probably like concentrations, or like paths that you can take, depending on which one. 265 00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:30.260 Jenny Duan: Alright sounds? Good? 266 00:48:33.354 --> 00:48:39.439 Jenny Duan: Well, this is these are such interesting questions.

Okay, not not expect this. 269 00:48:51.308 --> 00:48:53.500 huda: Yeah, I think that's it. 270 00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.819 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's interesting. 271 00:48:57.361 --> 00:49:04.000 Jenny Duan: Okay, well, the the this question, number 3. 0, this question, yeah. The 3rd question is just a typic",

So there's kind of a 275 00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.759 huda: 2 of the same kind, like for example, this one is 276 00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:31.710 huda: how you plan to pursue engineering interest at Penn. And then this one's like, like, specifically this measure. 277 00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:37.920 huda: So like how do I write like different essays for both of them. 278 00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.179 huda: So I think it's separate. 279 00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.780 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, I didn't even see it. 280 00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.989 Jenny Duan: Okay, is this a part of this question? 281 00:49:47.302 --> 00:49:49.800 huda: I think it's part of this upper question. 282 00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.410 Jenny Duan: Okay. 283 00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.959 huda: Or let me just double check. 284 00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.540 huda: Yeah, it's part of the upper question. 285 00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:03.780 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is more like, this question is more like, how like. 286 00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.309 Jenny Duan: actually, I think this is more the why. 287 00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:18.696 Jenny Duan: okay, if Y major is like a question. This is this, is this question is more like the major. And this question is more like the why, if that makes sense so in this question. You should talk about here. 288 00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.590 Jenny Duan: what classes 289 00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:32.970 Jenny Duan: at Penn, clubs, at Penn, organizations, etc. So this is just like how how you see yourself pursuing engineering at Penn. 290 00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.029 huda: And this one is. 291 00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:36.620 Jenny Duan: Why 292 00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:44.389 Jenny Duan: gam",
    "e development. They have your common app. So make sure not to overlap too much with that, or why digital media 293 00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:52.920 Jenny Duan: in design. So this one is like the process of being a creative and why creativity 294 00:50:53.230 --> 00:51:00.610 Jenny Duan: is important to you and like, maybe, why are interdisciplinary studies 295 00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:05.899 Jenny Duan: important to you?

So should I write like 298 00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:19.159 huda: fully 6 50, cause that's like a whole this whole size of like a common app essay. So 299 00:51:19.803 --> 00:51:22.529 huda: or should I read something like a little smaller. 300 00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.769 Jenny Duan: I think you should just write like 301 00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:34.609 Jenny Duan: I think, anything within that range, like, I think, about 550 at least, or 600 essays is good. This is basically asking you for another common app. 302 00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.269 Jenny Duan: which is insane, like 6 50 words, is a common app right. 303 00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:44.450 huda: Wait. Let me see. Cause I think some of the colleges didn't require like the common up essay like 304 00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.140 huda: fun. 305 00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.690 huda: Let's see. 306 00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:51.969 huda: Oh, yeah.

I didn't see that. 318 00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:33.229 Jenny Duan: I think. Well, they used to. I don't know if they still do, but 319 00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:38.650 Jenny Duan: actually no, Dartmouth makes you do a peer letter. I think Brown makes you do a video right? 320 00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.770 huda: Yeah, and Uchicago, I think. 321 00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.250 Jenny Duan: Wow, okay, 322 00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.080 Jenny Duan: okay, let me see. 323 00:52:58.570 --> 00:52:59.980 Jenny Duan: What? So what do you? 324 00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:05.619 Jenny Duan: What do you think you want to share about your creativity or your passion. That kind of differs from your common app statement. 325 00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:07.860 huda: Hmm! 326 00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.950 huda: I think 327 00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.610 huda: I think like I can use aspects of like 328 00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:32.649 huda: kind of previous common up essay drafts that I had which were like talking about like, kind of okay. Actually, this might be too like 329 00:53:33.446 --> 00:53:43.143 huda: unrelated. But just just like, put it out there. Like, kind of being like someone who is kind of in between a bunch of identities and like 330 00:53:43.670 --> 00:54:10.200 huda: and having like studying something that's like really is interdisciplinary. It's kind of I'm used to utilizing like not utilizing, like having, like these different sides of me, that kind of make me who I am. And then also like when I'm gaming and like when I'm like coding or like when I'm doing art. But I'm also writing algorithms like like in that way, I'm really use",

So you just talk about your interest, and then the conversation should naturally feel like you can be like I'm put. I'm interested in game development.

    "19 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree. And like, worst thing is, he could just ghost you. That's fine.

That would also be fine. But I just like the reason why is I just saw like on this reddit thread.
