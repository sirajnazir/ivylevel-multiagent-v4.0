Huda! How are you? 6 00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.160 huda: I'm great. How are you? 7 00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.560 Jenny Duan: That's muted. I did not hear you. 8 00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.409 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Yeah. How's it going? How's school? 9 00:02:15.394 --> 00:02:25.160 huda: It's gone. Well, I think today we just had our club fair for the I think it's supposed to be week long, but they cut it short to 2 days. And so far we have 16 new members. 10 00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:33.349 huda: And I'm hoping to expand that again this year. But yeah, I think it's going pretty well 11 00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.150 huda: as of now. 12 00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.289 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Is there a club fair, or something coming up like, how are you? Going to recruit new members. 13 00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:58.970 huda: Yeah, it's actually happened currently. So during lunch, we have like a table. And then we get to like, advertise a club and say what it's about. And then also just kind of like, have a sign up available so that people can just like sign up there. So like we have like 14 00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:17.709 huda: a Google sheets. And then people are just putting like their id number and names and everything and then, like I was there explaining what it is, and then we also give them like incentives to join by like having like treats that they decide to join, and then, like I have like my camera to show like what it's about. 15 00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.789 Jenny Duan: That's cool. Did you get to talk about your experience with J. Camp at all? 16 00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:43.729 huda: Not really. I think. I focus mainly on, like our short films that we produce as a club. And I talked like how we submit them for like film festivals. And we try to like get, we actually one of like, how one of our short films are like, have one like a film festival. So yeah. 17 00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.820 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, glad to hear that that's going. Well. How are classes and everything else? 18 00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:59.579 huda: Yeah, I think I'm like getting back on track for sure. I think there's like so like some of the teachers need to upgrade or like update my grades. 19 00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:06.420 huda: Because, like ever since I came back, there's a couple of missing assignments that had a great impact on my grades. 20 00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:21.920 huda: So yeah, I don't know. Like my report card might be a little. There's like a couple of these. But I I don't think that's final, for sure, because, like a lot of them is because of like the 1st week that I missed out, they haven't like updated that. 21 00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:30.109 Jenny Duan: Hmm! Do you get access to your report card at all times, or is it like, how does that work like? Is it your report card? Or is it like temporary grades. 22 00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.080 huda: It's just so like. 23 00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.610 huda: I think next week. 24 00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:52.660 huda: on Tuesday, we can see like our progress check kind of like it's not like anything official. So I'm going to go on a transcript or anything. We just. It's just like the parents know how our grades are currently and then, like, we could currently see our grades on canvas and everything. But like. 25 00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:54.729 huda: yeah, that's just like. 26 00:04:55.437 --> 00:04:58.149 huda: yeah, it's just like the parents know. 27 00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.360 Jenny Duan: Got it. Is there anything else that's like worrying, or concerning with school? Or is everything else okay. 28 00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:19.699 huda: Yeah, actually, I've been trying to set up a meeting with my counselor because like to like, I just check my transcript on like the place where we're gonna send transcript and it turns out like 29 00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:39.580 huda: like they still haven't fixed some of my grades on the Transcript. Remember like how like one of my teachers like missed messed up my one of my grades and gave me a B instead of an A so yeah. And like, I set up a meeting with my counselor to or like, I've tried setting a meeting, but she hasn't got back to me. 30 00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:42.310 huda: But yeah, I've done that as well. 31 00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.439 Jenny Duan: Pretty important I would. Did you follow up on that. 32 00:05:45.670 --> 00:06:02.530 huda: Yeah, I actually like, a couple of days ago, I sent in like a form like the form that you're supposed to fill out for a council meeting, and then she hasn't replied to that. So then today I emailed her personally and I asked her if she'd be available for a meeting, and I don't think she responded to that. 33 00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:11.300 Jenny Duan: Got it. Well, I hope that that gets resolved soon, cause that's pretty concerning and you definitely need that fixed before you send in your applications. 34 00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:24.240 Jenny Duan: speaking of applications. Good job. On working on the Riley's Way Foundation project, or the Riley Riley's way, like atsays. Were you able to finish those, or did you want to take another look at those. 35 00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:33.339 huda: Yeah, I ended up just submitting them because I didn't notice it was also like a ruling base thing. So like, I don't want to get into a. 36 00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.272 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. I briefly looked at the changes that you've made, and I think that they look good. So 37 00:06:41.230 --> 00:07:03.820 Jenny Duan: yeah, I mean not. There wasn't anything super huge, in the 1st place, so like small tweaks, and like small word, changes, and you should be good there. Other than that. I know that last time we talked about like this season, being like, full of the college application questions, and like full of essay writing questions. Have you gotten a chance to look at the Disney Dreamers Academy questions. 38 00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.672 huda: Yeah, I'm actually just started brainstorming like an idea. For the 1st question, 39 00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.749 Jenny Duan: Do you have that on a document. 40 00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.999 huda: Yeah. Also, I wanted to talk to you about quest rich. 41 00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Oh, yes, that's definitely. 42 00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:24.610 huda: Actually like, I've been doing some thinking. And and I feel like 43 00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:31.780 huda: I should just apply early instead of doing quest rich because I did a little bit of research. And I think it's 44 00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.710 huda: mainly like focus on like academics. 45 00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:41.259 huda: So like the Gpa and sat matter like a lot more than normal. Outcomes. 46 00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.590 Jenny Duan: Relations. 47 00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:51.389 huda: And then also, like I don't. I wouldn't say like the most low income like individuals, so I don't know if that like that would probably work against me. 48 00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.185 Jenny Duan: And 49 00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.450 huda: So like I don't think I'd be like a perfect candidate for Questbridge, so I don't know if, like. 50 00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:04.723 huda: I probably won't even make it past like final. So I I don't know if I really want to take that like 51 00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.470 huda: risk. I guess. 52 00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 53 00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:21.150 Jenny Duan: Then, I think that we should just apply through the normal process, and chances are you'll probably get a lot of financial aid and scholarships anyways, especially if we're applying for a lot of like external scholarships so hopefully that works out in your favor, too. 54 00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:29.640 Jenny Duan: But that sounds like a good idea. I just wanted to bring it to your attention to see if that was something that you might be interested in. But 55 00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.190 Jenny Duan: if not, then that's okay, too. 56 00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:40.300 Jenny Duan: sounds good. So let's focus on the Disney Dreamers Academy. I'm wondering if you have started a doc for that. And if you could share that with me. If you have. 57 00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.600 huda: Yeah. 58 00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.880 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 59 00:08:44.306 --> 00:08:46.010 huda: I was like. So 60 00:08:46.030 --> 00:09:02.419 huda: I think last time we agreed on or not agreed on. But like we decided that I wanted to apply to Usc. And Stanford early and so like you also mentioned how like applying to Stanford early won't really give too much of an advantage to like 61 00:09:02.844 --> 00:09:13.620 huda: everything. So I was thinking, like I was concerned, like applying early to a different college instead. I'm not sure, though. But I was like 62 00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.250 huda: like a couple of options I was thinking of like. 63 00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.649 huda: I think Carnegie Mellon has like a good advantage of applying early. 64 00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:26.999 huda: I think it's the problem is that it's binding so that might be like. 65 00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:36.079 huda: But like, if I I think I'd really like Cmu, and I'd be obviously like fond of going there so I don't think that's too much of a problem, but. 66 00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. I remember, like, when we 1st talked about this, you said that you wanted to apply for Stanford early, knowing the risk. 67 00:09:42.106 --> 00:09:53.169 Jenny Duan: That it wouldn't really benefit. So I'm curious like, what has changed your mind. Has it been like you started liking Carnegie? 9 more? You've stopped liking something as much or like what sort of prompted that change here. 68 00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:08.369 huda: I was just like I was. I kind of like forgot like why I was applying Stanford early, because I feel like if it doesn't have too much of a benefit like I don't know if I don't know if I would want to waste that on like I mean, like 69 00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:16.659 huda: like an opportunity that might not benefit me too much like I think it's probably just like the same acceptance rate which is really tough is any 70 00:10:17.122 --> 00:10:21.649 huda: and I think I mean, obviously, it's not just based upon like acceptance rate. But like 71 00:10:22.124 --> 00:10:23.620 huda: I was just like. 72 00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:30.380 huda: I don't know for certain if I want to like, Do Cmu. But like that was just like one of the things I was considering. 73 00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:37.540 huda: But yeah, I just. I'm not sure if, like, I want to waste my early decision school on like something that won't really benefit me. 74 00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 75 00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:59.819 Jenny Duan: let's see, what is your prior. Let's think about your priority in college applications like, what is your priority to like maximize, your chances of going to the best school like, are you looking for the most prestigious school like? What type of school are you looking for during this early application round. Because I think, like people apply early for a couple of reasons, first, st to like. 76 00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:16.600 Jenny Duan: because that's their dream school. And that's like where they want to go the most, or because they want to maximize like their chances of getting into the most prestigious institution, or it could be a balance of the 2. But I'm curious, like what stands out as a priority for you during the early round. 77 00:11:17.663 --> 00:11:39.099 huda: Honestly, I think I'm fine with, like any of the colleges that are on my list. Like applying early to all of them, because I think all of them have a really good program. And I think, like Usc, for sure, I know apply early, because I know that has not too much like a good acceptance like advantage, but it does have an advantage in like the merit scholarship. 78 00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.000 Jenny Duan: Definitely. 79 00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.610 huda: And so like, for sure, I wanna apply to Usc early. But in terms of like 80 00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.320 huda: the other school that I want to apply to. Besides, Usc, like I think 81 00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:56.690 huda: I mean, I really do want to go to Singapore, but I think I wanted to choose something that would like 82 00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.459 huda: I guess. Maximize my ability to get in, I guess. 83 00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:11.620 huda: I think like at the end of the always comes down to like my profile, but like, yeah, like, I think something that could benefit me a lot in that way. 84 00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.189 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Let me look at what else is on your list? 85 00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.740 Jenny Duan: One second. 86 00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:29.110 Jenny Duan: I think out of these schools that are, I'm looking at your college list on the notion right now. Are you interested in? How interested are you at Northeastern. 87 00:12:31.145 --> 00:12:36.810 huda: I don't remember. I I don't remember what the program for Northeastern was. 88 00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:46.740 huda: actually, Northwestern has a program for interactive media, which is, I thought, was pretty interesting, I think. 89 00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.940 huda: okay. 90 00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.560 Jenny Duan: So did you mean to put? 91 00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.920 Jenny Duan: Should we replace Northeastern with Northwestern? I'm not sure if that was the intention there, or did you want. 92 00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.610 huda: Both. 93 00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.550 Jenny Duan: Both. Okay, let me add. 94 00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.770 Jenny Duan: let me just add Northwestern. I don't see it right here. 95 00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.240 Jenny Duan: Oh. 96 00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.659 Jenny Duan: for Northeastern you, said Bfa. Game design. 97 00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.690 huda: Oh. 98 00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.880 huda: I 99 00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.919 huda: wait. Let me just double check. 100 00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.569 huda: Okay. Northwestern program was. 101 00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.730 Jenny Duan: Cause. I think if you wanna maximize your chances, I would go for 102 00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:56.680 Jenny Duan: I would go for Northeastern or Northwestern because Cmu's acceptance for early decision was only 12.5% compared to 11% last year. But for northeastern it was 33% compared to 7% overall. And for Northwestern it was 24% compared to 7%. So if we just want to look at like the maximizing perspective, then I think, like either Northeastern in Boston or Northwestern in Chicago, would be like good for that purpose. 103 00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.480 huda: Well. 104 00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.036 Jenny Duan: Northwestern has 105 00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.429 Jenny Duan: Let's see, the Major is. 106 00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.480 huda: Oh, I think that the major that would be radio television and film 107 00:14:31.266 --> 00:14:42.869 huda: for Northwestern. And then, like cause, there's an area study for production, which includes entry to game studio, 2D computer animation, AR, storytelling 108 00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.070 huda: and then writing video games and stuff like that. 109 00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.707 Jenny Duan: I feel like if you should do Northwestern 110 00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.206 Jenny Duan: you might be more interested in doing like I know they have a good 111 00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.119 Jenny Duan: They have a good 112 00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.519 Jenny Duan: Cs program. So I would encourage you to consider something related to that. 113 00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.085 huda: I 114 00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.460 huda: would that be like really impacted. 115 00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.779 Jenny Duan: since it's a private school, I'm inclined to say no. 116 00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.470 huda: So like directly, like computer science. 117 00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because, like. 118 00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:36.289 Jenny Duan: it's not like, you have no background in computer science. I think you have a really good background in computer science. So I don't think that that would be like in 119 00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.870 Jenny Duan: issue, for you 120 00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.249 Jenny Duan: see what else they have here. 121 00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.830 Jenny Duan: They have. 122 00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.110 Jenny Duan: an adjunct major in science and human culture. 123 00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.150 Jenny Duan: It's interesting. 124 00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:31.440 Jenny Duan: I would, I would say, like Cs major at Northwestern is not a bad way to go, and I don't think it would be. I don't think it would be bad if you applied directly into computer science. 125 00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.889 huda: Okay. Then. Oh. 126 00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.559 Jenny Duan: Strong enough to do that. 127 00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.310 Jenny Duan: If you want to. 128 00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.749 huda: I think there's there's also computer science of like concentrations. 129 00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:44.660 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 130 00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.910 huda: and. 131 00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.070 Jenny Duan: Oh! 132 00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:54.510 huda: Oh, okay, there's like, also one exactly for like interactive media. So there's like, interactive information visualization. 133 00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.033 huda: It's like, 134 00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:04.250 huda: that's pretty cool. I think? I think, yeah, I'm definitely considering Northwestern for early decision, for early. 135 00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:10.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah, Northwestern doesn't cap, they don't cap the computer science program. 136 00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.829 Jenny Duan: only the theater major has an enrollment cap of 100 students per class. 137 00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:17.354 huda: Wow! 138 00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:21.449 Jenny Duan: But you're not A, you're not a theater, major. So I think you're okay. 139 00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:37.329 Jenny Duan: And then they also have a both A BA and a Bs in computer science at Northwestern. So you could do it in the arts and Sciences, in the College of Arts and Sciences, or you could do it in the school of engineering. So that would be nice. They also have, like 140 00:17:37.939 --> 00:17:47.099 Jenny Duan: a artificial Intelligence minor, which is really interesting. So if you wanted to do like a different major. You could do a minor in like AI specifically, if you wanted 141 00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:52.369 Jenny Duan: and I think there's different concentrations that might be good for you. 142 00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.649 huda: Oh, cool. Okay, then. I think 143 00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.969 huda: I think I really like the program at Northwestern. Then I think 144 00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.100 huda: I'll definitely like 145 00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.119 huda: I think I'll discuss it like my parents, and see what they're. 146 00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 147 00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.419 huda: But yeah, I'm like leaning towards drug Buster. Now. 148 00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.970 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, wow! This is a like, really big change, not a bad thing. 149 00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.300 huda: Yeah. 150 00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:28.539 Jenny Duan: Like, we're awesome that we're figuring this out. So in that case we can go with Northwestern and then you're still working with Marissa right on, or Erin on your common app statement. How's that going along. 151 00:18:29.414 --> 00:18:32.555 huda: That's going very well. I think we like kind of 152 00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:44.219 huda: not really finalized. But we made like a solid draft for my essay like the common app essay. But then, now I'm kind of considering changing the topic because I feel like it's a bit 153 00:18:44.796 --> 00:18:48.960 huda: mine is like a bit too serious. And I feel like 154 00:18:49.522 --> 00:19:00.809 huda: I don't know. I was reading looking at it. I don't think it conveys myself like too uniquely, I think. Like, I think. Wait, let me share draft. The draft actually. 155 00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.040 Jenny Duan: Okay. Sure. Yeah. 156 00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:09.979 huda: But yeah, I'm not happy with it, and I think I might write. I have 2 different ideas, one inspired like the wordle idea that you gave 157 00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.350 huda: And then I also want to do one about like 158 00:19:15.227 --> 00:19:17.530 huda: it's kind of rid of a peach fuzz 159 00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:22.729 huda: so like that's not like a name that they call like 160 00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:28.599 huda: I like a mustache that young girls have, and I feel like it's like something that's really like 161 00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:38.969 huda: work like I think I could use as an analogy for something, but like, I think, that in general has like having that when I was younger they were like forms like. 162 00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:44.639 huda: I guess, like a thicker skin, cause I totally deal with like lots of comments about it, and like. 163 00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.969 huda: I don't know. I think like I was going with like 164 00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.830 huda: one way. I could have one about. It is like every time like a shave like my peach was like kind of grow. 165 00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.250 Jenny Duan: Just requested address. 166 00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.080 Jenny Duan: but. 167 00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.700 huda: Yeah. 168 00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.400 Jenny Duan: But continue what you're saying. 169 00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:17.670 huda: Yeah, every time, I guess, like I shave a mustache. It like goes back thicker, and it kind of works as an analogy about like every time like I try to Americanize myself and like try to fit in in different settings, like, for example, like 170 00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:35.560 huda: like. For example, when I was at journalism camp, like, I tried to like completely, hide away my technology side and show that I was like a videographer filmmaker. Like the other side, just kind of kept coming back. And so like, I think that I could use that as an analogy. But so like working out like 171 00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.069 huda: idea, and I haven't written a draft yet. But yeah. 172 00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:46.438 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's a great good idea. I feel like so much of the value gained from doing 173 00:20:47.090 --> 00:21:09.299 Jenny Duan: doing these drafts is just like learning more about yourself, which is the really cool part like it definitely can take many, many different stories to get the right comment up. And at the end of the day. It should feel like it represents you. And you know, like you could write a really good essay like the essay could be flawless, but maybe just isn't for fully representative of you. Let me read this. 174 00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.320 Jenny Duan: I love this. 175 00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:34.870 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 176 00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.179 Jenny Duan: This sentence, or like this part, is really good. 177 00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.979 Jenny Duan: I would say right here this feels a little bit like a too much of a jump. 178 00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.190 Jenny Duan: I'm confused right here. 179 00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:02.209 huda: Yeah, I think it was. It made a little more sense before when we're doing it as like 180 00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:10.439 huda: it. Was originally like a neural network tutorial like how to make a neural network. But I think it's kind of confusing without it. 181 00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:25.470 Jenny Duan: I think I love the topic. I feel like it does jump around a little bit right now, so I think it likes like 182 00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.849 Jenny Duan: the writing is very good. I just think the like. 183 00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.109 Jenny Duan: I don't know the pieces could use a little bit more glue in between. 184 00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.850 Jenny Duan: But I think like, if you take this and you frame it in a different way, it looks good. 185 00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:46.300 Jenny Duan: I can't wait to see the next version. So you think you're gonna write a new essay rather than keeping this one. 186 00:22:47.392 --> 00:22:55.010 huda: Yeah, I think I'm gonna I mean, I think I still kind of like this one. But I just feel like it's not really unique. And I think. 187 00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:04.230 huda: like, while the story, I guess, is me, I feel like I don't know. It's like the code. Snippets aren't really unique enough. I don't feel like I have like a good enough book. 188 00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:08.239 huda: So I think there's like, definitely like a better relationship. 189 00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.843 Jenny Duan: Got it? 190 00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.669 Jenny Duan: So you're gonna write the peach fuzz idea, and then the wordle idea 191 00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:20.810 Jenny Duan: cool. 192 00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:43.130 Jenny Duan: I would say, like, just keep on writing different versions of the draft, and and telling your story in different ways, until you find one like method of conveying your story that feels best like one analogy or one way of writing that feels most aligned. And then from there you can like worry about adding details and making it good. But I feel like once you have the framework there. That's probably gonna be like the most 193 00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.990 Jenny Duan: important part. 194 00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:55.069 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Do you want to move on to the Disney dreamers. Draft, or do you want to keep? Spend some more time talking about this, for now. 195 00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:59.799 huda: I think that we could work on the Disney essays right now. 196 00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.260 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 197 00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:06.900 Jenny Duan: So walk me through your thinking for this 1st question. Tell me, tell us why you want to be a Disney dreamer. 198 00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:14.270 huda: Yeah. So actually, I didn't know a little bit about the program before. But now I kind of did a little bit of research about it. 199 00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:26.319 huda: and then a few things that they consider in like their acceptance is like intellectual curiosity, compassion, courage. 200 00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:31.790 huda: positive outlook, and a generous spirit and optimism, optimism about the future. 201 00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.339 huda: And like I was thinking about like writing about 202 00:24:36.682 --> 00:25:04.459 huda: I guess, like being an immigrant and you know, like coming to America, and like I feel like I don't know if it's too cliche, but maybe, like the way I like bring, it could be a little more different. But, coming to America, you you have this thing called the American Dream, and going to the Land of Opportunities, and I was like super excited about like oh, like I have the platform to do all these things right now. But I like 203 00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:13.579 huda: quickly realized that the land of opportunities was only the like land of change. If like people took advantage of these things and created something out of it. 204 00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.130 Jenny Duan: And. 205 00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:20.999 huda: And so like. I think I wanted to talk about how like being a Disney dreamer would be like 206 00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:33.330 huda: one of those opportunities that, you know, platforms people for change, and that it shows that like the future can be changed through these like land of opportunities. 207 00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.399 huda: Yeah, I think that's where I kind of wanted to go with it. 208 00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.730 Jenny Duan: And how exactly can the future be changed with as the land of opportunities. 209 00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.979 huda: I'm sorry. What did you say? 210 00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.909 Jenny Duan: How exactly do you see, like the future being changed through this like land of opportunities? 211 00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:54.299 huda: I think definitely like with the program. 212 00:25:54.926 --> 00:25:56.119 huda: There's like. 213 00:25:57.217 --> 00:26:15.589 huda: there's like a lot of like networking with other young people who are also equally as like passionate about, like, you know, creating change and like seeing, like the future, that how you can constantly be improving of the different things that are out there. And also like 214 00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:25.879 huda: like reading on the website. It says that it will help you like network and give you edge in the workplace, and so like 215 00:26:26.132 --> 00:26:28.800 huda: a big part of, I guess a big part of like 216 00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:41.389 huda: being able to make change in the future is being able to like, know people and like I guess, having connection. So I think, like this event could connect me with other people. 217 00:26:42.136 --> 00:26:43.249 huda: And like. 218 00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.199 huda: maybe give me a diverse perspective on, like how I can 219 00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:52.890 huda: like different ways that can impact the future. Because I think there's like lots of career workshops. 220 00:26:53.766 --> 00:26:59.120 huda: and like, you can meet mentors who also did make change 221 00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.510 huda: and so like, I can learn about like their ways and maybe implement on what I do. 222 00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:20.705 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a really good idea. I feel like this. I don't think you need a specific analogy. I think you can just like start off with like talking about yourself. So the framework can be like you writing about yourself and your perspective, how you came to the Us. How you're an immigrant, and then 223 00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:32.110 Jenny Duan: from there, just like going straight into the question of like, why, the Disney dreamer program is powerful. Maybe you can write about some of the outcomes of Disney. Dreamers like you can say, like 224 00:27:32.595 --> 00:27:40.169 Jenny Duan: like Disney, dreamers have gone on to Xyz, and I want to be part of a community that has the power to like whatever 225 00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.269 Jenny Duan: change the world in in these ways, or to like. 226 00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.350 Jenny Duan: I think Disney is all about like 227 00:27:45.550 --> 00:28:02.349 Jenny Duan: everyday magic in the world so like to to instill like everyday magic, or to you can use, like Disney type language, or to like, create hope or inspire other people, or use, like the the themes from their mission and their like vision statements which you can look up online. 228 00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.200 Jenny Duan: do you feel like 229 00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:10.520 Jenny Duan: you have good enough of a grasp on this question. What's the word, Count? 230 00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.149 huda: Let me double check. 231 00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.220 Jenny Duan: Okay. 232 00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.449 huda: 600 words is the Max. I think. 233 00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:07.119 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that's like more than normal. Do you feel like you have enough to write for 600 words? Do you have any questions about this. 234 00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.240 huda: Yeah, I think so 235 00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.529 huda: can I. So I could do like 2 paragraphs, maybe, and like. 236 00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:29.369 huda: or maybe if I require more than that, but like the 1st one really detailing about like my journey as an immigrant, like what I thought going into America. And like, do I talk about things that I've done currently that like have like. 237 00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.750 huda: I guess, attributed to like 238 00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.618 huda: of the change that I've been able to make or 239 00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.850 Jenny Duan: How do you envision yourself, weaving that in. 240 00:29:39.004 --> 00:29:40.500 huda: Like, for example, like 241 00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:50.889 huda: what I'm talking about, like how coming to America has given me so many opportunities, maybe talk about what those opportunities have been like, how I've been able to like to something. 242 00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:51.210 Jenny Duan: I was. 243 00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.430 huda: Those opportunities. 244 00:29:52.430 --> 00:30:00.470 Jenny Duan: I would definitely do that. And you can just write like a couple of sentences. Try to keep it like pretty humble and light but yes. 245 00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.790 huda: Well. 246 00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:12.440 huda: and also like that, website gives you an option to like. Say it. So I think like. 247 00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.569 huda: would it be better to just like 248 00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.270 huda: read it out loud for the 249 00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.650 huda: question, or 250 00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.119 huda: would it be better to like write it. 251 00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:34.454 Jenny Duan: What feels most authentic to you? In in which medium do you feel like you would be able to 252 00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.460 Jenny Duan: like, be the most authentic to yourself? 253 00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:48.960 huda: I think, like reading out loud. I might be able to like emphasize things that I wouldn't be able to read or like. I wouldn't be able to write. I think. 254 00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.789 Jenny Duan: Then, in that case that sounds good. 255 00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:59.390 huda: Oh, it looks like the next ones are 1,200 characters. Oh, these are characters, I think. 256 00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.980 Jenny Duan: Characters. Okay, that's super short. 257 00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.200 huda: Oh, okay. 258 00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:04.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 259 00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:10.149 huda: In that case, like I think I will. I don't need to go to detail about like the things that I've done. 260 00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:11.950 Jenny Duan: Okay? 261 00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.399 Jenny Duan: Sounds good. Yeah. 262 00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:24.539 Jenny Duan: I think if you want to just write like name, drop them. That's also fine. Just see what you have room for. 263 00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.550 huda: Okay. 264 00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:36.070 Jenny Duan: Okay. The next question is, about which Disney story inspires you most. Why did you choose Rapunzel? 265 00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:51.340 huda: I think Rapunzel like, and kind of similar to the 1st question about like opportunities and everything. And like. So she's been locked in like a tower, for, like her whole life, and so still, she has all these different hobbies of like 266 00:31:51.787 --> 00:32:08.080 huda: painting. And I'm cooking and like cleaning all these different, like different passions, and like things that she does even though she like, has a lack of opportunity. And it's definitely informed, like the way I've done things 267 00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.959 huda: and like it gave me like a unique perspective that, like sometimes. 268 00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:17.049 huda: sometimes like, you don't need like these opportunities to be like given to you like these aren't like 269 00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:18.390 huda: things that 270 00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.340 huda: like 271 00:32:19.723 --> 00:32:25.730 huda: I guess, like there's like, always like a way to make opportunities for yourself. I think that's what I've learned from Rapunzel. 272 00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:32.960 Jenny Duan: And then how are you gonna connect her story to yours in the limited character count like, what examples from your life do you think you're gonna bring up. 273 00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.389 huda: I think I could talk about like being from like a rural town, maybe, and like. 274 00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.410 Jenny Duan: And how it sometimes feels like a tower. 275 00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:47.709 huda: Yeah. And also like talking about like how they don't have like a newspaper to or like they don't really have like 276 00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.160 huda: I guess different resources like a 277 00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:54.025 huda: newspaper. Yeah. 278 00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.879 huda: the girls coding like environment. 279 00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:10.194 huda: and yeah. And then just like having paving my own way by like having like empowering AI, and then having folklift, and like kind of 280 00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:17.510 huda: just like having to like like.

Oh, perfect! 319 00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.060 huda: Yeah, I think I just have to like 320 00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.619 huda: like hack into it. 321 00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.740 Jenny Duan: As are that Cs skills coming in. Huh? 322 00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.909 huda: And yeah, that's it. 323 00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.500 Jenny Duan: Great? 324 00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:37.020 Jenny Duan: So let's start with q. 1. Describe a moment in your life that has shaped who you are, and explained how it has influenced your personal growth. 325 00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:41.790 Jenny Duan: I feel like you have lots of questions. I mean, you have lots of stories that could 326 00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:48.669 Jenny Duan: that this one you could use like. I feel like the $20 bill. One is very good. 327 00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.750 Jenny Duan: You want to use that one, or if there are any other moments. 328 00:37:52.240 --> 00:38:05.049 huda: That sounds really good. Actually, I think that one that one can. Also, I I think they did mention the website that they that they would like to help like people that are in like the best financial situation. So. 329 00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.710 Jenny Duan: Like perfect. Then let's like, let's let's tap into that. 330 00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.790 Jenny Duan: Take up. 331 00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:14.119 Jenny Duan: Q. 2. What is your dream career? And 332 00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:19.000 Jenny Duan: what are you gonna write for this one. I feel like gaming is a good way that really connects with Disney. 333 00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:21.380 huda: Yeah. So I think. 334 00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.679 huda: yeah, I think, like game develop. I could talk about game development 335 00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.790 huda: and like. 336 00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.709 huda: wanting to like make it so that education can be available and like 337 00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:44.840 huda: in like gamify form, and especially like one thing I wanted to mention is how there's a lot of people who like 338 00:38:45.509 --> 00:38:52.539 huda: having mental disabilities and can't have like can't focus on things like, for example, Adhd. 339 00:38:53.012 --> 00:38:56.997 huda: and like gamified learning really helps with that. And 340 00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:11.839 huda: yeah, I just like, I think, like wanting to to transform the space of game game development. For from interesting like a pastime thing. And like, I'm just kind of like being there. Like. 341 00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.850 huda: I guess. Passively. And like everyone's seeing as if it's like 342 00:39:17.457 --> 00:39:27.390 huda: something that isn't that important to like something that can like actually give people educations for like people that can't understand certain things in different ways. 343 00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 344 00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.049 Jenny Duan: And what challenges 345 00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.019 Jenny Duan: are you facing in reaching this dream? 346 00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:36.790 huda: No. 347 00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:37.400 Jenny Duan: Are you working? 348 00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.084 huda: There's like a couple of challenges. So for one like education, 349 00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:48.629 huda: like education and gaming is like a bit hard to like marry those 2 things, because a lot of 350 00:39:49.055 --> 00:39:52.609 huda: people interested in gaming aren't interested in like learning 351 00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.390 huda: things. 352 00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.930 huda: and then another thing is like. 353 00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.200 huda: kind of the field of game development is a bit stigmatized, and like. 354 00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.939 huda: especially, it's like seen as 355 00:40:05.421 --> 00:40:27.210 huda: kind of like a pastime, like a fun thing to do, and it doesn't. And people don't realize that games can have an impact on people. And like the way to overcome that is to build projects that have like actual impact on people like, for example, distributing to like like different classrooms and showed me that like, it's actually 356 00:40:27.677 --> 00:40:30.359 huda: can teach people. And that like 357 00:40:30.824 --> 00:40:35.360 huda: like showing it as an educational tool rather than just like a fun game. 358 00:40:35.759 --> 00:40:40.069 huda: Has been like my way in like helping to solve this problem. 359 00:40:41.940 --> 00:41:00.840 Jenny Duan: Definitely, I would say in terms of what the challenges are. Let's make them also like more personal challenges. I think they want to hear, like what are not. I think it's really important to recognize, like the broader industry challenges. But like what are some of the challenges that you personally are facing during this journey. 360 00:41:02.719 --> 00:41:12.819 huda: Obviously, there's like that one layer of like kind of dissatisfaction with like the field of game development. Like, for example, like 361 00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:25.119 huda: I mean, like some of my like family members. Aren't that supportive of like the career? Because they don't know about like how much money that would make or you know, like that kind of 362 00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:26.290 huda: problem. But 363 00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:31.610 huda: yeah, like, I think that's like a personal thing that's like kind of come in the way. 364 00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.040 huda: And 365 00:41:37.000 --> 00:42:00.959 Jenny Duan: One thing you can also touch on is like a lot of game development. Coursework is like very expensive and inaccessible like, because it's not a widely popularized subject in school like there's no such thing as like a game development class in most high schools like to to learn actually how to do game development. It either takes a lot of self initiative or it's very expensive to buy like a game development course for thousands of dollars, or, like. 366 00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:11.200 Jenny Duan: you know, to access game development learning resources. So maybe that's 1 thing you can say, like, because you care about education like you also care about making game development in and of itself like more accessible to people. 367 00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:18.169 Jenny Duan: and so like that could also be cool. But I think you should touch on like the cost of accessing game development, education. 368 00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.670 huda: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. 369 00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.860 Jenny Duan: And also like 370 00:42:27.458 --> 00:42:46.240 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is the case, but like, is, is it hard to get internships in game development like. Is it a very nepotism driven industry or not like, I don't know. Like, for example, film is very nepotism, driven in like Hollywood and stuff. But I don't like Spec. Cs is not, for example, but I don't know if game development is. 371 00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.591 huda: I think, like the the thing with extra game development industry is, it's 372 00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:56.000 huda: like a lot of like young game developers are kind of like overworked and 373 00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:09.600 huda: like, especially when they they're like entry level. They they get like kind of do all the different responsibilities, and like they don't get as much credit. And then also, like especially, I think there's been like a job like 374 00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.970 huda: I want. I don't know if I should call it a recession. But like 375 00:43:13.421 --> 00:43:20.069 huda: almost like there's like a lack of job options for game developers in recent years. And like 376 00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.959 huda: I think that's like highly highly like. 377 00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:28.999 huda: you know, to like large like studios like epic games, and like 378 00:43:29.438 --> 00:43:33.119 huda: and like reikis, and everything like those kind of like 379 00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:39.799 huda: giving more senior positions rather than like any options to younger people trying to get into the field. 380 00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.240 Jenny Duan: Watch that. 381 00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:44.960 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. 382 00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.700 Jenny Duan: okay. So 383 00:43:50.840 --> 00:44:00.049 Jenny Duan: I think those are all good things to highlight. I feel like we have a lot of of material here. Do you feel confident writing this? Q. 2. Or do you have any other questions about Q. 2. 384 00:44:01.481 --> 00:44:03.340 huda: So it talks about like. 385 00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:07.830 huda: how have you been able to over? Or how are we working to overcome them? 386 00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.150 Jenny Duan: I think like. 387 00:44:09.704 --> 00:44:14.829 huda: If I can like, select, like one specific problem to focus on, maybe 388 00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:24.290 huda: or like not one. But like whichever couple I should like focus on. I can like, maybe adjust like the like, those like how I'm overcoming those problems. I think. 389 00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.829 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Let's say, if you choose, like 390 00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:35.599 Jenny Duan: 2 or 3. So maybe we can say, okay, cost of accessing gay development. Education is one. You can talk about how you had to self learn 391 00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.729 Jenny Duan: a lot like you can talk about. I assume you self learned unity right. 392 00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:41.190 huda: Yeah. 393 00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.820 Jenny Duan: Development skills. I feel like that's really good cause. It also emphasizes, like your perseverance and your drive. 394 00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.919 Jenny Duan: you can say, like. 395 00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.130 Jenny Duan: maybe. 396 00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:00.690 Jenny Duan: What are the challenges? 397 00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.710 Jenny Duan: People don't realize that games have an impact on people. You can talk about synthoria 398 00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.640 Jenny Duan: and distributing it. 399 00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:17.099 Jenny Duan: I think those 2 are good to start with. Are there any other issues that jump out to you that you want to address, or that I mean that you want to write about addressing. 400 00:45:18.831 --> 00:45:25.510 huda: I think those who are definitely like the most important and developed, I think, from the other problems. 401 00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.019 huda: And I think those are the ones that have 402 00:45:28.696 --> 00:45:32.270 huda: worked on like, I guess, like overcoming those. 403 00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:41.820 Jenny Duan: Great. Let's just start with those 2. Do you feel prepared for the rest of this question, or do you have any other like, I guess questions about this question. 404 00:45:43.114 --> 00:45:50.800 huda: So, okay, is this type of the type of question where I just like, answer the question. Or do I kind of write this in a story. 405 00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:54.860 Jenny Duan: I think you can 406 00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:05.129 Jenny Duan: either works. I think if you just answer this, it's fine. If you wanna like. One thing I could say is like you could do an anecdote of what your life looks like in 10 years 407 00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.080 Jenny Duan: like. 408 00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.880 huda: At the beginning. 409 00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.609 Jenny Duan: Like a setting the vision type of thing.

And then hopefully. We can also have a touch base on like your Northwestern status, and whether or not you want to apply early decision there. 511 01:01:07.889 --> 01:01:18.139 Jenny Duan: And then, after we finish looking over your Disney dreamer. Application editing things. We'll move on to the Elks scholarship application.

I don't think. Did you turn it off. 514 01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:33.219 huda: Yeah, for some reason, like my Zoom Meetings, like not responding, not sure why. 515 01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:38.699 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think maybe just like computer out of application memory or something that happens to me all the time. 516 01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:39.370 huda: Yeah. 517 01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:47.552 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool then.

Huda! How are you? 6 00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.160 huda: I'm great. How are you? 7 00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.560 Jenny Duan: That's muted. I did not hear you. 8 00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.409 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Yeah. How's it going? How's school? 9 00:02:15.394 --> 00:02:25.160 huda: It's gone. Well, I think today we just had our club fair for the I think it's supposed to be week long, but they cut it short to 2 days. And so far we have 16 new members. 10 00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:33.349 huda: And I'm hoping to expand that again this year. But yeah, I think it's going pretty well 11 00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.150 huda: as of now. 12 00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.289 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Is there a club fair, or something coming up like, how are you? Going to recruit new members. 13 00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:58.970 huda: Yeah, it's actually happened currently. So during lunch, we have like a table. And then we get to like, advertise a club and say what it's about. And then also just kind of like, have a sign up available so that people can just like sign up there. So like we have like 14 00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:17.709 huda: a Google sheets. And then people are just putting like their id number and names and everything and then, like I was there explaining what it is, and then we also give them like incentives to join by like having like treats that they decide to join, and then, like I have like my camera to show like what it's about. 15 00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.789 Jenny Duan: That's cool. Did you get to talk about your experience with J. Camp at all? 16 00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:43.729 huda: Not really. I think. I focus mainly on, like our short films tha",
    "t we produce as a club. And I talked like how we submit them for like film festivals. And we try to like get, we actually one of like, how one of our short films are like, have one like a film festival. So yeah. 17 00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.820 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, glad to hear that that's going. Well. How are classes and everything else? 18 00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:59.579 huda: Yeah, I think I'm like getting back on track for sure. I think there's like so like some of the teachers need to upgrade or like update my grades. 19 00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:06.420 huda: Because, like ever since I came back, there's a couple of missing assignments that had a great impact on my grades. 20 00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:21.920 huda: So yeah, I don't know. Like my report card might be a little. There's like a couple of these. But I I don't think that's final, for sure, because, like a lot of them is because of like the 1st week that I missed out, they haven't like updated that. 21 00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:30.109 Jenny Duan: Hmm! Do you get access to your report card at all times, or is it like, how does that work like? Is it your report card? Or is it like temporary grades. 22 00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.080 huda: It's just so like. 23 00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.610 huda: I think next week. 24 00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:52.660 huda: on Tuesday, we can see like our progress check kind of like it's not like anything official. So I'm going to go on a transcript or anything. We just. It's just like the parents know how our grades are currently and then, like, we could currently see our grades on canvas and everything. But like. 25 00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:54.729 huda: yeah, that's just like. 26 00:04:55.437 --> 00:04:58.149 huda: yeah, it's just like the parents know. 27 00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.360 Jenny Duan: Got it. Is there anything else that's like worrying, or concerning with school? Or is everything else okay. 28 00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:19.699 huda: Yeah, actually, I've been trying to set u",
    "p a meeting with my counselor because like to like, I just check my transcript on like the place where we're gonna send transcript and it turns out like 29 00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:39.580 huda: like they still haven't fixed some of my grades on the Transcript. Remember like how like one of my teachers like missed messed up my one of my grades and gave me a B instead of an A so yeah. And like, I set up a meeting with my counselor to or like, I've tried setting a meeting, but she hasn't got back to me. 30 00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:42.310 huda: But yeah, I've done that as well. 31 00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.439 Jenny Duan: Pretty important I would. Did you follow up on that. 32 00:05:45.670 --> 00:06:02.530 huda: Yeah, I actually like, a couple of days ago, I sent in like a form like the form that you're supposed to fill out for a council meeting, and then she hasn't replied to that. So then today I emailed her personally and I asked her if she'd be available for a meeting, and I don't think she responded to that. 33 00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:11.300 Jenny Duan: Got it. Well, I hope that that gets resolved soon, cause that's pretty concerning and you definitely need that fixed before you send in your applications. 34 00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:24.240 Jenny Duan: speaking of applications. Good job. On working on the Riley's Way Foundation project, or the Riley Riley's way, like atsays. Were you able to finish those, or did you want to take another look at those. 35 00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:33.339 huda: Yeah, I ended up just submitting them because I didn't notice it was also like a ruling base thing. So like, I don't want to get into a. 36 00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.272 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. I briefly looked at the changes that you've made, and I think that they look good. So 37 00:06:41.230 --> 00:07:03.820 Jenny Duan: yeah, I mean not. There wasn't anything super huge, in the 1st place, so like small tweaks, and like small word, changes, and you should be good there. Other th",
    "an that. I know that last time we talked about like this season, being like, full of the college application questions, and like full of essay writing questions. Have you gotten a chance to look at the Disney Dreamers Academy questions. 38 00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.672 huda: Yeah, I'm actually just started brainstorming like an idea. For the 1st question, 39 00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.749 Jenny Duan: Do you have that on a document. 40 00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.999 huda: Yeah. Also, I wanted to talk to you about quest rich. 41 00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Oh, yes, that's definitely. 42 00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:24.610 huda: Actually like, I've been doing some thinking. And and I feel like 43 00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:31.780 huda: I should just apply early instead of doing quest rich because I did a little bit of research. And I think it's 44 00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.710 huda: mainly like focus on like academics. 45 00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:41.259 huda: So like the Gpa and sat matter like a lot more than normal. Outcomes. 46 00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.590 Jenny Duan: Relations. 47 00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:51.389 huda: And then also, like I don't. I wouldn't say like the most low income like individuals, so I don't know if that like that would probably work against me. 48 00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.185 Jenny Duan: And 49 00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.450 huda: So like I don't think I'd be like a perfect candidate for Questbridge, so I don't know if, like. 50 00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:04.723 huda: I probably won't even make it past like final. So I I don't know if I really want to take that like 51 00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.470 huda: risk. I guess. 52 00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 53 00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:21.150 Jenny Duan: Then, I think that we should just apply through the normal process, and chances are you'll probably get a lot of financial aid and scholarships anyways, especially if we're applying for a lot of like external scholarships so ",
    "hopefully that works out in your favor, too. 54 00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:29.640 Jenny Duan: But that sounds like a good idea. I just wanted to bring it to your attention to see if that was something that you might be interested in. But 55 00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.190 Jenny Duan: if not, then that's okay, too. 56 00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:40.300 Jenny Duan: sounds good. So let's focus on the Disney Dreamers Academy. I'm wondering if you have started a doc for that. And if you could share that with me. If you have. 57 00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.600 huda: Yeah. 58 00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.880 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 59 00:08:44.306 --> 00:08:46.010 huda: I was like. So 60 00:08:46.030 --> 00:09:02.419 huda: I think last time we agreed on or not agreed on. But like we decided that I wanted to apply to Usc. And Stanford early and so like you also mentioned how like applying to Stanford early won't really give too much of an advantage to like 61 00:09:02.844 --> 00:09:13.620 huda: everything. So I was thinking, like I was concerned, like applying early to a different college instead. I'm not sure, though. But I was like 62 00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.250 huda: like a couple of options I was thinking of like. 63 00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.649 huda: I think Carnegie Mellon has like a good advantage of applying early. 64 00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:26.999 huda: I think it's the problem is that it's binding so that might be like. 65 00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:36.079 huda: But like, if I I think I'd really like Cmu, and I'd be obviously like fond of going there so I don't think that's too much of a problem, but. 66 00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. I remember, like, when we 1st talked about this, you said that you wanted to apply for Stanford early, knowing the risk. 67 00:09:42.106 --> 00:09:53.169 Jenny Duan: That it wouldn't really benefit. So I'm curious like, what has changed your mind. Has it been like you started liking Carnegie? 9 more? You've stopped liking something as mu",
    "ch or like what sort of prompted that change here. 68 00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:08.369 huda: I was just like I was. I kind of like forgot like why I was applying Stanford early, because I feel like if it doesn't have too much of a benefit like I don't know if I don't know if I would want to waste that on like I mean, like 69 00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:16.659 huda: like an opportunity that might not benefit me too much like I think it's probably just like the same acceptance rate which is really tough is any 70 00:10:17.122 --> 00:10:21.649 huda: and I think I mean, obviously, it's not just based upon like acceptance rate. But like 71 00:10:22.124 --> 00:10:23.620 huda: I was just like. 72 00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:30.380 huda: I don't know for certain if I want to like, Do Cmu. But like that was just like one of the things I was considering. 73 00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:37.540 huda: But yeah, I just. I'm not sure if, like, I want to waste my early decision school on like something that won't really benefit me. 74 00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 75 00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:59.819 Jenny Duan: let's see, what is your prior. Let's think about your priority in college applications like, what is your priority to like maximize, your chances of going to the best school like, are you looking for the most prestigious school like? What type of school are you looking for during this early application round. Because I think, like people apply early for a couple of reasons, first, st to like. 76 00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:16.600 Jenny Duan: because that's their dream school. And that's like where they want to go the most, or because they want to maximize like their chances of getting into the most prestigious institution, or it could be a balance of the 2. But I'm curious, like what stands out as a priority for you during the early round. 77 00:11:17.663 --> 00:11:39.099 huda: Honestly, I think I'm fine with, like any of the colleges that are on my list. Like applying early to al",
    "l of them, because I think all of them have a really good program. And I think, like Usc, for sure, I know apply early, because I know that has not too much like a good acceptance like advantage, but it does have an advantage in like the merit scholarship. 78 00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.000 Jenny Duan: Definitely. 79 00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.610 huda: And so like, for sure, I wanna apply to Usc early. But in terms of like 80 00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.320 huda: the other school that I want to apply to. Besides, Usc, like I think 81 00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:56.690 huda: I mean, I really do want to go to Singapore, but I think I wanted to choose something that would like 82 00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.459 huda: I guess. Maximize my ability to get in, I guess. 83 00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:11.620 huda: I think like at the end of the always comes down to like my profile, but like, yeah, like, I think something that could benefit me a lot in that way. 84 00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.189 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Let me look at what else is on your list? 85 00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.740 Jenny Duan: One second. 86 00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:29.110 Jenny Duan: I think out of these schools that are, I'm looking at your college list on the notion right now. Are you interested in? How interested are you at Northeastern. 87 00:12:31.145 --> 00:12:36.810 huda: I don't remember. I I don't remember what the program for Northeastern was. 88 00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:46.740 huda: actually, Northwestern has a program for interactive media, which is, I thought, was pretty interesting, I think. 89 00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.940 huda: okay. 90 00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.560 Jenny Duan: So did you mean to put? 91 00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.920 Jenny Duan: Should we replace Northeastern with Northwestern? I'm not sure if that was the intention there, or did you want. 92 00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.610 huda: Both. 93 00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.550 Jenny Duan: Both. Okay, let me add. 94 00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.770 Jenny",
    " Duan: let me just add Northwestern. I don't see it right here. 95 00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.240 Jenny Duan: Oh. 96 00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.659 Jenny Duan: for Northeastern you, said Bfa. Game design. 97 00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.690 huda: Oh. 98 00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.880 huda: I 99 00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.919 huda: wait. Let me just double check. 100 00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.569 huda: Okay. Northwestern program was. 101 00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.730 Jenny Duan: Cause. I think if you wanna maximize your chances, I would go for 102 00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:56.680 Jenny Duan: I would go for Northeastern or Northwestern because Cmu's acceptance for early decision was only 12.5% compared to 11% last year. But for northeastern it was 33% compared to 7% overall. And for Northwestern it was 24% compared to 7%. So if we just want to look at like the maximizing perspective, then I think, like either Northeastern in Boston or Northwestern in Chicago, would be like good for that purpose. 103 00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.480 huda: Well. 104 00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.036 Jenny Duan: Northwestern has 105 00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.429 Jenny Duan: Let's see, the Major is. 106 00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.480 huda: Oh, I think that the major that would be radio television and film 107 00:14:31.266 --> 00:14:42.869 huda: for Northwestern. And then, like cause, there's an area study for production, which includes entry to game studio, 2D computer animation, AR, storytelling 108 00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.070 huda: and then writing video games and stuff like that. 109 00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.707 Jenny Duan: I feel like if you should do Northwestern 110 00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.206 Jenny Duan: you might be more interested in doing like I know they have a good 111 00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.119 Jenny Duan: They have a good 112 00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.519 Jenny Duan: Cs program. So I would encourage you to consider something related to that. 113 00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.085 huda: I 1",
    "14 00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.460 huda: would that be like really impacted. 115 00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.779 Jenny Duan: since it's a private school, I'm inclined to say no. 116 00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.470 huda: So like directly, like computer science. 117 00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because, like. 118 00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:36.289 Jenny Duan: it's not like, you have no background in computer science. I think you have a really good background in computer science. So I don't think that that would be like in 119 00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.870 Jenny Duan: issue, for you 120 00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.249 Jenny Duan: see what else they have here. 121 00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.830 Jenny Duan: They have. 122 00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.110 Jenny Duan: an adjunct major in science and human culture. 123 00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.150 Jenny Duan: It's interesting. 124 00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:31.440 Jenny Duan: I would, I would say, like Cs major at Northwestern is not a bad way to go, and I don't think it would be. I don't think it would be bad if you applied directly into computer science. 125 00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.889 huda: Okay. Then. Oh. 126 00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.559 Jenny Duan: Strong enough to do that. 127 00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.310 Jenny Duan: If you want to. 128 00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.749 huda: I think there's there's also computer science of like concentrations. 129 00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:44.660 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 130 00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.910 huda: and. 131 00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.070 Jenny Duan: Oh! 132 00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:54.510 huda: Oh, okay, there's like, also one exactly for like interactive media. So there's like, interactive information visualization. 133 00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.033 huda: It's like, 134 00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:04.250 huda: that's pretty cool. I think? I think, yeah, I'm definitely considering Northwestern for early decision, for early. 135 00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:10.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah, Northwestern do",
    "esn't cap, they don't cap the computer science program. 136 00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.829 Jenny Duan: only the theater major has an enrollment cap of 100 students per class. 137 00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:17.354 huda: Wow! 138 00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:21.449 Jenny Duan: But you're not A, you're not a theater, major. So I think you're okay. 139 00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:37.329 Jenny Duan: And then they also have a both A BA and a Bs in computer science at Northwestern. So you could do it in the arts and Sciences, in the College of Arts and Sciences, or you could do it in the school of engineering. So that would be nice. They also have, like 140 00:17:37.939 --> 00:17:47.099 Jenny Duan: a artificial Intelligence minor, which is really interesting. So if you wanted to do like a different major. You could do a minor in like AI specifically, if you wanted 141 00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:52.369 Jenny Duan: and I think there's different concentrations that might be good for you. 142 00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.649 huda: Oh, cool. Okay, then. I think 143 00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.969 huda: I think I really like the program at Northwestern. Then I think 144 00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.100 huda: I'll definitely like 145 00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.119 huda: I think I'll discuss it like my parents, and see what they're. 146 00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 147 00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.419 huda: But yeah, I'm like leaning towards drug Buster. Now. 148 00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.970 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, wow! This is a like, really big change, not a bad thing. 149 00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.300 huda: Yeah. 150 00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:28.539 Jenny Duan: Like, we're awesome that we're figuring this out. So in that case we can go with Northwestern and then you're still working with Marissa right on, or Erin on your common app statement. How's that going along. 151 00:18:29.414 --> 00:18:32.555 huda: That's going very well. I think we like kind of 152 00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:44.219 huda: no",
    "t really finalized. But we made like a solid draft for my essay like the common app essay. But then, now I'm kind of considering changing the topic because I feel like it's a bit 153 00:18:44.796 --> 00:18:48.960 huda: mine is like a bit too serious. And I feel like 154 00:18:49.522 --> 00:19:00.809 huda: I don't know. I was reading looking at it. I don't think it conveys myself like too uniquely, I think. Like, I think. Wait, let me share draft. The draft actually. 155 00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.040 Jenny Duan: Okay. Sure. Yeah. 156 00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:09.979 huda: But yeah, I'm not happy with it, and I think I might write. I have 2 different ideas, one inspired like the wordle idea that you gave 157 00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.350 huda: And then I also want to do one about like 158 00:19:15.227 --> 00:19:17.530 huda: it's kind of rid of a peach fuzz 159 00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:22.729 huda: so like that's not like a name that they call like 160 00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:28.599 huda: I like a mustache that young girls have, and I feel like it's like something that's really like 161 00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:38.969 huda: work like I think I could use as an analogy for something, but like, I think, that in general has like having that when I was younger they were like forms like. 162 00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:44.639 huda: I guess, like a thicker skin, cause I totally deal with like lots of comments about it, and like. 163 00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.969 huda: I don't know. I think like I was going with like 164 00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.830 huda: one way. I could have one about. It is like every time like a shave like my peach was like kind of grow. 165 00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.250 Jenny Duan: Just requested address. 166 00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.080 Jenny Duan: but. 167 00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.700 huda: Yeah. 168 00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.400 Jenny Duan: But continue what you're saying. 169 00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:17.670 huda: Yeah, every time, I guess, like I shave a mustache",
    ". It like goes back thicker, and it kind of works as an analogy about like every time like I try to Americanize myself and like try to fit in in different settings, like, for example, like 170 00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:35.560 huda: like. For example, when I was at journalism camp, like, I tried to like completely, hide away my technology side and show that I was like a videographer filmmaker. Like the other side, just kind of kept coming back. And so like, I think that I could use that as an analogy. But so like working out like 171 00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.069 huda: idea, and I haven't written a draft yet. But yeah. 172 00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:46.438 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's a great good idea. I feel like so much of the value gained from doing 173 00:20:47.090 --> 00:21:09.299 Jenny Duan: doing these drafts is just like learning more about yourself, which is the really cool part like it definitely can take many, many different stories to get the right comment up. And at the end of the day. It should feel like it represents you. And you know, like you could write a really good essay like the essay could be flawless, but maybe just isn't for fully representative of you. Let me read this. 174 00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.320 Jenny Duan: I love this. 175 00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:34.870 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 176 00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.179 Jenny Duan: This sentence, or like this part, is really good. 177 00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.979 Jenny Duan: I would say right here this feels a little bit like a too much of a jump. 178 00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.190 Jenny Duan: I'm confused right here. 179 00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:02.209 huda: Yeah, I think it was. It made a little more sense before when we're doing it as like 180 00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:10.439 huda: it. Was originally like a neural network tutorial like how to make a neural network. But I think it's kind of confusing without it. 181 00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:25.470 Jenny Duan: I think I love the topic. I feel like it do",
    "es jump around a little bit right now, so I think it likes like 182 00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.849 Jenny Duan: the writing is very good. I just think the like. 183 00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.109 Jenny Duan: I don't know the pieces could use a little bit more glue in between. 184 00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.850 Jenny Duan: But I think like, if you take this and you frame it in a different way, it looks good. 185 00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:46.300 Jenny Duan: I can't wait to see the next version. So you think you're gonna write a new essay rather than keeping this one. 186 00:22:47.392 --> 00:22:55.010 huda: Yeah, I think I'm gonna I mean, I think I still kind of like this one. But I just feel like it's not really unique. And I think. 187 00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:04.230 huda: like, while the story, I guess, is me, I feel like I don't know. It's like the code. Snippets aren't really unique enough. I don't feel like I have like a good enough book. 188 00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:08.239 huda: So I think there's like, definitely like a better relationship. 189 00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.843 Jenny Duan: Got it? 190 00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.669 Jenny Duan: So you're gonna write the peach fuzz idea, and then the wordle idea 191 00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:20.810 Jenny Duan: cool. 192 00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:43.130 Jenny Duan: I would say, like, just keep on writing different versions of the draft, and and telling your story in different ways, until you find one like method of conveying your story that feels best like one analogy or one way of writing that feels most aligned. And then from there you can like worry about adding details and making it good. But I feel like once you have the framework there. That's probably gonna be like the most 193 00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.990 Jenny Duan: important part. 194 00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:55.069 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Do you want to move on to the Disney dreamers. Draft, or do you want to keep? Spend some more time talking about this, for now. 195 00:23:5",
    "6.039 --> 00:23:59.799 huda: I think that we could work on the Disney essays right now. 196 00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.260 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 197 00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:06.900 Jenny Duan: So walk me through your thinking for this 1st question. Tell me, tell us why you want to be a Disney dreamer. 198 00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:14.270 huda: Yeah. So actually, I didn't know a little bit about the program before. But now I kind of did a little bit of research about it. 199 00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:26.319 huda: and then a few things that they consider in like their acceptance is like intellectual curiosity, compassion, courage. 200 00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:31.790 huda: positive outlook, and a generous spirit and optimism, optimism about the future. 201 00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.339 huda: And like I was thinking about like writing about 202 00:24:36.682 --> 00:25:04.459 huda: I guess, like being an immigrant and you know, like coming to America, and like I feel like I don't know if it's too cliche, but maybe, like the way I like bring, it could be a little more different. But, coming to America, you you have this thing called the American Dream, and going to the Land of Opportunities, and I was like super excited about like oh, like I have the platform to do all these things right now. But I like 203 00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:13.579 huda: quickly realized that the land of opportunities was only the like land of change. If like people took advantage of these things and created something out of it. 204 00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.130 Jenny Duan: And. 205 00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:20.999 huda: And so like. I think I wanted to talk about how like being a Disney dreamer would be like 206 00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:33.330 huda: one of those opportunities that, you know, platforms people for change, and that it shows that like the future can be changed through these like land of opportunities. 207 00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.399 huda: Yeah, I think that's where I kind of wanted to go with it. 20",
    "8 00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.730 Jenny Duan: And how exactly can the future be changed with as the land of opportunities. 209 00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.979 huda: I'm sorry. What did you say? 210 00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.909 Jenny Duan: How exactly do you see, like the future being changed through this like land of opportunities? 211 00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:54.299 huda: I think definitely like with the program. 212 00:25:54.926 --> 00:25:56.119 huda: There's like. 213 00:25:57.217 --> 00:26:15.589 huda: there's like a lot of like networking with other young people who are also equally as like passionate about, like, you know, creating change and like seeing, like the future, that how you can constantly be improving of the different things that are out there. And also like 214 00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:25.879 huda: like reading on the website. It says that it will help you like network and give you edge in the workplace, and so like 215 00:26:26.132 --> 00:26:28.800 huda: a big part of, I guess a big part of like 216 00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:41.389 huda: being able to make change in the future is being able to like, know people and like I guess, having connection. So I think, like this event could connect me with other people. 217 00:26:42.136 --> 00:26:43.249 huda: And like. 218 00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.199 huda: maybe give me a diverse perspective on, like how I can 219 00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:52.890 huda: like different ways that can impact the future. Because I think there's like lots of career workshops. 220 00:26:53.766 --> 00:26:59.120 huda: and like, you can meet mentors who also did make change 221 00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.510 huda: and so like, I can learn about like their ways and maybe implement on what I do. 222 00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:20.705 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a really good idea. I feel like this. I don't think you need a specific analogy. I think you can just like start off with like talking about yourself. So the framework can be like you writing about",
    " yourself and your perspective, how you came to the Us. How you're an immigrant, and then 223 00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:32.110 Jenny Duan: from there, just like going straight into the question of like, why, the Disney dreamer program is powerful. Maybe you can write about some of the outcomes of Disney. Dreamers like you can say, like 224 00:27:32.595 --> 00:27:40.169 Jenny Duan: like Disney, dreamers have gone on to Xyz, and I want to be part of a community that has the power to like whatever 225 00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.269 Jenny Duan: change the world in in these ways, or to like. 226 00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.350 Jenny Duan: I think Disney is all about like 227 00:27:45.550 --> 00:28:02.349 Jenny Duan: everyday magic in the world so like to to instill like everyday magic, or to you can use, like Disney type language, or to like, create hope or inspire other people, or use, like the the themes from their mission and their like vision statements which you can look up online. 228 00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.200 Jenny Duan: do you feel like 229 00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:10.520 Jenny Duan: you have good enough of a grasp on this question. What's the word, Count? 230 00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.149 huda: Let me double check. 231 00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.220 Jenny Duan: Okay. 232 00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.449 huda: 600 words is the Max. I think. 233 00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:07.119 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that's like more than normal. Do you feel like you have enough to write for 600 words? Do you have any questions about this. 234 00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.240 huda: Yeah, I think so 235 00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.529 huda: can I. So I could do like 2 paragraphs, maybe, and like. 236 00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:29.369 huda: or maybe if I require more than that, but like the 1st one really detailing about like my journey as an immigrant, like what I thought going into America. And like, do I talk about things that I've done currently that like have like. 237 00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.750 ",
    "huda: I guess, attributed to like 238 00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.618 huda: of the change that I've been able to make or 239 00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.850 Jenny Duan: How do you envision yourself, weaving that in. 240 00:29:39.004 --> 00:29:40.500 huda: Like, for example, like 241 00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:50.889 huda: what I'm talking about, like how coming to America has given me so many opportunities, maybe talk about what those opportunities have been like, how I've been able to like to something. 242 00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:51.210 Jenny Duan: I was. 243 00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.430 huda: Those opportunities. 244 00:29:52.430 --> 00:30:00.470 Jenny Duan: I would definitely do that. And you can just write like a couple of sentences. Try to keep it like pretty humble and light but yes. 245 00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.790 huda: Well. 246 00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:12.440 huda: and also like that, website gives you an option to like. Say it. So I think like. 247 00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.569 huda: would it be better to just like 248 00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.270 huda: read it out loud for the 249 00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.650 huda: question, or 250 00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.119 huda: would it be better to like write it. 251 00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:34.454 Jenny Duan: What feels most authentic to you? In in which medium do you feel like you would be able to 252 00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.460 Jenny Duan: like, be the most authentic to yourself? 253 00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:48.960 huda: I think, like reading out loud. I might be able to like emphasize things that I wouldn't be able to read or like. I wouldn't be able to write. I think. 254 00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.789 Jenny Duan: Then, in that case that sounds good. 255 00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:59.390 huda: Oh, it looks like the next ones are 1,200 characters. Oh, these are characters, I think. 256 00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.980 Jenny Duan: Characters. Okay, that's super short. 257 00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.200 huda: Oh, okay. 258 00:31",
    ":04.020 --> 00:31:04.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 259 00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:10.149 huda: In that case, like I think I will. I don't need to go to detail about like the things that I've done. 260 00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:11.950 Jenny Duan: Okay? 261 00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.399 Jenny Duan: Sounds good. Yeah. 262 00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:24.539 Jenny Duan: I think if you want to just write like name, drop them. That's also fine. Just see what you have room for. 263 00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.550 huda: Okay. 264 00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:36.070 Jenny Duan: Okay. The next question is, about which Disney story inspires you most. Why did you choose Rapunzel? 265 00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:51.340 huda: I think Rapunzel like, and kind of similar to the 1st question about like opportunities and everything. And like. So she's been locked in like a tower, for, like her whole life, and so still, she has all these different hobbies of like 266 00:31:51.787 --> 00:32:08.080 huda: painting. And I'm cooking and like cleaning all these different, like different passions, and like things that she does even though she like, has a lack of opportunity. And it's definitely informed, like the way I've done things 267 00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.959 huda: and like it gave me like a unique perspective that, like sometimes. 268 00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:17.049 huda: sometimes like, you don't need like these opportunities to be like given to you like these aren't like 269 00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:18.390 huda: things that 270 00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.340 huda: like 271 00:32:19.723 --> 00:32:25.730 huda: I guess, like there's like, always like a way to make opportunities for yourself. I think that's what I've learned from Rapunzel. 272 00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:32.960 Jenny Duan: And then how are you gonna connect her story to yours in the limited character count like, what examples from your life do you think you're gonna bring up. 273 00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.389 huda: I think I could talk about like being from like",
    " a rural town, maybe, and like. 274 00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.410 Jenny Duan: And how it sometimes feels like a tower. 275 00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:47.709 huda: Yeah. And also like talking about like how they don't have like a newspaper to or like they don't really have like 276 00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.160 huda: I guess different resources like a 277 00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:54.025 huda: newspaper. Yeah. 278 00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.879 huda: the girls coding like environment. 279 00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:10.194 huda: and yeah. And then just like having paving my own way by like having like empowering AI, and then having folklift, and like kind of 280 00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:17.510 huda: just like having to like like. How Rapunzel like has all these different hobbies. I have these like organizations to. 281 00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.760 Jenny Duan: I called back a lot. 282 00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.970 huda: Of opportunity. 283 00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:26.860 Jenny Duan: You can do an analogy like Rapunzel's painting your Xyz like, yeah, exactly 284 00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.130 Jenny Duan: perfect. 285 00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.190 Jenny Duan: any other. 286 00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.610 Jenny Duan: What? What other questions are included in this application. 287 00:33:44.692 --> 00:33:48.619 huda: There was like some essay questions which are 1,200 characters. 288 00:33:49.236 --> 00:33:53.200 huda: Once hold on, let me just say paste them into. 289 00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:08.880 Jenny Duan: Are you thinking about reading all of these out loud, or do you think that you'll only read some of these out loud? 290 00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:14.429 huda: I think I'll just read some of these out loud. I don't know if, like 291 00:34:14.707 --> 00:34:21.390 huda: some of them are like more meaningful that I and I can like, or actually, maybe I could just do the shorter ones. I think 292 00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.980 huda: it makes a lot more sense 293 00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:25.340 h",
    "uda: cool 294 00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:32.920 huda: like. 295 00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:39.630 huda: you're being weird. Okay?

And 332 00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:19.000 Jenny Duan: what are you gonna write for this one. I feel like gaming is a good way that really connects with Disney. 333 00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:21.380 huda: Yeah. So I",
    " think. 334 00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.679 huda: yeah, I think, like game develop. I could talk about game development 335 00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.790 huda: and like. 336 00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.709 huda: wanting to like make it so that education can be available and like 337 00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:44.840 huda: in like gamify form, and especially like one thing I wanted to mention is how there's a lot of people who like 338 00:38:45.509 --> 00:38:52.539 huda: having mental disabilities and can't have like can't focus on things like, for example, Adhd. 339 00:38:53.012 --> 00:38:56.997 huda: and like gamified learning really helps with that. And 340 00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:11.839 huda: yeah, I just like, I think, like wanting to to transform the space of game game development. For from interesting like a pastime thing. And like, I'm just kind of like being there. Like. 341 00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.850 huda: I guess. Passively. And like everyone's seeing as if it's like 342 00:39:17.457 --> 00:39:27.390 huda: something that isn't that important to like something that can like actually give people educations for like people that can't understand certain things in different ways. 343 00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 344 00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.049 Jenny Duan: And what challenges 345 00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.019 Jenny Duan: are you facing in reaching this dream? 346 00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:36.790 huda: No. 347 00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:37.400 Jenny Duan: Are you working? 348 00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.084 huda: There's like a couple of challenges. So for one like education, 349 00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:48.629 huda: like education and gaming is like a bit hard to like marry those 2 things, because a lot of 350 00:39:49.055 --> 00:39:52.609 huda: people interested in gaming aren't interested in like learning 351 00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.390 huda: things. 352 00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.930 huda: and then another thing is like. 353 00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.200",
    " huda: kind of the field of game development is a bit stigmatized, and like. 354 00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.939 huda: especially, it's like seen as 355 00:40:05.421 --> 00:40:27.210 huda: kind of like a pastime, like a fun thing to do, and it doesn't. And people don't realize that games can have an impact on people. And like the way to overcome that is to build projects that have like actual impact on people like, for example, distributing to like like different classrooms and showed me that like, it's actually 356 00:40:27.677 --> 00:40:30.359 huda: can teach people. And that like 357 00:40:30.824 --> 00:40:35.360 huda: like showing it as an educational tool rather than just like a fun game. 358 00:40:35.759 --> 00:40:40.069 huda: Has been like my way in like helping to solve this problem. 359 00:40:41.940 --> 00:41:00.840 Jenny Duan: Definitely, I would say in terms of what the challenges are. Let's make them also like more personal challenges. I think they want to hear, like what are not. I think it's really important to recognize, like the broader industry challenges. But like what are some of the challenges that you personally are facing during this journey. 360 00:41:02.719 --> 00:41:12.819 huda: Obviously, there's like that one layer of like kind of dissatisfaction with like the field of game development. Like, for example, like 361 00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:25.119 huda: I mean, like some of my like family members. Aren't that supportive of like the career? Because they don't know about like how much money that would make or you know, like that kind of 362 00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:26.290 huda: problem. But 363 00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:31.610 huda: yeah, like, I think that's like a personal thing that's like kind of come in the way. 364 00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.040 huda: And 365 00:41:37.000 --> 00:42:00.959 Jenny Duan: One thing you can also touch on is like a lot of game development. Coursework is like very expensive and inaccessible like, because it's not a widely",
    " popularized subject in school like there's no such thing as like a game development class in most high schools like to to learn actually how to do game development. It either takes a lot of self initiative or it's very expensive to buy like a game development course for thousands of dollars, or, like. 366 00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:11.200 Jenny Duan: you know, to access game development learning resources. So maybe that's 1 thing you can say, like, because you care about education like you also care about making game development in and of itself like more accessible to people. 367 00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:18.169 Jenny Duan: and so like that could also be cool. But I think you should touch on like the cost of accessing game development, education. 368 00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.670 huda: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. 369 00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.860 Jenny Duan: And also like 370 00:42:27.458 --> 00:42:46.240 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is the case, but like, is, is it hard to get internships in game development like. Is it a very nepotism driven industry or not like, I don't know. Like, for example, film is very nepotism, driven in like Hollywood and stuff. But I don't like Spec. Cs is not, for example, but I don't know if game development is. 371 00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.591 huda: I think, like the the thing with extra game development industry is, it's 372 00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:56.000 huda: like a lot of like young game developers are kind of like overworked and 373 00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:09.600 huda: like, especially when they they're like entry level. They they get like kind of do all the different responsibilities, and like they don't get as much credit. And then also, like especially, I think there's been like a job like 374 00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.970 huda: I want. I don't know if I should call it a recession. But like 375 00:43:13.421 --> 00:43:20.069 huda: almost like there's like a lack of job options for game developers in recent years. And like 3",
    "76 00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.959 huda: I think that's like highly highly like. 377 00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:28.999 huda: you know, to like large like studios like epic games, and like 378 00:43:29.438 --> 00:43:33.119 huda: and like reikis, and everything like those kind of like 379 00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:39.799 huda: giving more senior positions rather than like any options to younger people trying to get into the field. 380 00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.240 Jenny Duan: Watch that. 381 00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:44.960 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. 382 00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.700 Jenny Duan: okay. So 383 00:43:50.840 --> 00:44:00.049 Jenny Duan: I think those are all good things to highlight. I feel like we have a lot of of material here. Do you feel confident writing this? Q. 2. Or do you have any other questions about Q. 2. 384 00:44:01.481 --> 00:44:03.340 huda: So it talks about like. 385 00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:07.830 huda: how have you been able to over? Or how are we working to overcome them? 386 00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.150 Jenny Duan: I think like. 387 00:44:09.704 --> 00:44:14.829 huda: If I can like, select, like one specific problem to focus on, maybe 388 00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:24.290 huda: or like not one. But like whichever couple I should like focus on. I can like, maybe adjust like the like, those like how I'm overcoming those problems. I think. 389 00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.829 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Let's say, if you choose, like 390 00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:35.599 Jenny Duan: 2 or 3. So maybe we can say, okay, cost of accessing gay development. Education is one. You can talk about how you had to self learn 391 00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.729 Jenny Duan: a lot like you can talk about. I assume you self learned unity right. 392 00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:41.190 huda: Yeah. 393 00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.820 Jenny Duan: Development skills. I feel like that's really good cause. It also emphasizes, like your perseverance and your drive. 394 00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.919 Je",
    "nny Duan: you can say, like. 395 00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.130 Jenny Duan: maybe. 396 00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:00.690 Jenny Duan: What are the challenges? 397 00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.710 Jenny Duan: People don't realize that games have an impact on people. You can talk about synthoria 398 00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.640 Jenny Duan: and distributing it. 399 00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:17.099 Jenny Duan: I think those 2 are good to start with. Are there any other issues that jump out to you that you want to address, or that I mean that you want to write about addressing. 400 00:45:18.831 --> 00:45:25.510 huda: I think those who are definitely like the most important and developed, I think, from the other problems. 401 00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.019 huda: And I think those are the ones that have 402 00:45:28.696 --> 00:45:32.270 huda: worked on like, I guess, like overcoming those. 403 00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:41.820 Jenny Duan: Great. Let's just start with those 2. Do you feel prepared for the rest of this question, or do you have any other like, I guess questions about this question. 404 00:45:43.114 --> 00:45:50.800 huda: So, okay, is this type of the type of question where I just like, answer the question. Or do I kind of write this in a story. 405 00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:54.860 Jenny Duan: I think you can 406 00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:05.129 Jenny Duan: either works. I think if you just answer this, it's fine. If you wanna like. One thing I could say is like you could do an anecdote of what your life looks like in 10 years 407 00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.080 Jenny Duan: like. 408 00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.880 huda: At the beginning. 409 00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.609 Jenny Duan: Like a setting the vision type of thing. But 410 00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.529 Jenny Duan: I think that's like up to you. 411 00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:14.120 huda: Okay, that sounds cool. 412 00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:16.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 413 00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:20.880 Jenny Duan: well. 414 00:46:25.170 ",
