How's it going. 2 00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.479 huda: Hello! It's going. Well, how are you? 3 00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.279 Jenny Duan: I'm really good. Can you hear the ocean in the background? 4 00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.340 Jenny Duan: Wait, listen! 5 00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:31.620 huda: I can't really hear it. 6 00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.200 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm in Florida right now, which has been really nice. I'm on Spring Break. So I'm visiting my friend's house. 7 00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:41.560 Jenny Duan: In Florida. And it's just been 8 00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:51.250 Jenny Duan: super super relaxing, we went on. She has a boat on the water today. So we went like, I'm right next to the ocean, like we went onto the water, and it was super super nice. 9 00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.060 huda: That's so cool. 10 00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.890 Jenny Duan: Yeah, when is your break? Or did it already happen. 11 00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.510 huda: It just started, yeah. 12 00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.209 Jenny Duan: Oh, so you're also on break. Awesome. 13 00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.960 huda: Yeah, what do you. 14 00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.660 Jenny Duan: Have you been up to during the break. 15 00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:08.048 huda: So my sister came back from color. So I've been spending a little bit of time with her. And 16 00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.779 huda: yeah, so like, I guess we haven't done much, but I think I'm I'm gonna try and get my permit this break. So. 17 00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:25.619 Jenny Duan: Oh, good luck! That's super exciting! I remember when I got my permit for the first time, too, was super nervous. But I think if you do like. If you read the manual and do the practice test online, then you'll be fine. 18 00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:37.440 Jenny Duan: I'll actually peep your comment up document earlier today. How did that? How did writing those feel? And do you have any reflections? After preparing all of that and getting to practice it. 19 00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:55.520 huda: Yeah, I definitely say, like, some of them are fine. But like I wouldn't say like the Esses were my best work. And they also didn't really like go up to like the word limit. And I think I just kind of like rushed a few of them. But then I did definitely brainstorm some good ideas and like 20 00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:05.680 huda: kind of connections throughout. I think just like thinking about stories where it was pretty meaningful, and like thinking about how to respond to each question. 21 00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.120 Jenny Duan: Did your teacher give you feed any feedback yet, or not? Yet. 22 00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.370 huda: Not yet. 23 00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:20.040 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that that totally makes sense, especially given that you know you were supposed to write 5 common apps in a couple of days, which is absolutely crazy. But yeah. 24 00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.260 Jenny Duan: And then, 25 00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.450 Jenny Duan: so couple of the brief things, were you able to meet with your vice president or yeah, your vice principal. And how's that going. 26 00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:42.909 huda: So, oh, yeah, also, I forgot, I have like an update. So for student use, I decided, I, I'm gonna start a new segment where I'm gonna be interviewing new like the school Admins, and kind of getting to know them and like what they do behind. 27 00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.540 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's so perfect! That is such a get to know them, too, and set a impression. 28 00:05:48.940 --> 00:06:13.000 huda: Yeah. So so like I said, I like brainstormed a few questions with them on a dog, and then I'll message my vice principal. I was like, oh, I'd love to get to meet you and like get to know you. I'm starting a new segment. I'd love to interview you. And yeah. So I I set up a meeting. It should be on Monday. But like I need her like to double confirm. But yeah. 29 00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.830 Jenny Duan: Really good, and that is such a smart, smart strategy. Who did like. 30 00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.336 huda: Thank you. 31 00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:26.540 Jenny Duan: Meet all your admin, given them a positive impression. And yeah, okay, was your empowering AI last session this today, or is it tomorrow? 32 00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:31.070 huda: I think we're gonna be postoning it to tomorrow. 33 00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.230 Jenny Duan: Okay. 34 00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.590 Jenny Duan: to, tomorrow. 35 00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.370 huda: Yeah. 36 00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.340 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 37 00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.890 Jenny Duan: Let me make a note of that. 38 00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.980 Jenny Duan: Institution goes from to tomorrow. 39 00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:48.969 Jenny Duan: Did you set up the call with the nonprofit marketing? Guy? 40 00:06:49.270 --> 00:07:12.770 huda: Yeah, so he was. Talk about like, kind of like, how hard was it for you to start? Set up an initiative and everything. And so he's like a senior he has, like a really successful organization from like many different chapters around the country and stuff. And so like. I was also asking advice like, How do you grow your nonprofit so that it has like more reach and stuff, and 41 00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:23.280 huda: So for folklift he gave like suggestions so like obviously to like collaborate with like pre-existing initiatives. And so he's he like 42 00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:48.259 huda: kind of suggested. I think I don't remember if he said I think he said, Chamber of Commerce so like, since they're like small businesses. They'd like be in contact with many and then he also said, like he asked me like, Oh, what college you really want to go to? And I said, Sanford. So then he was like, I'm sure Stanford has, like some sort of club or program which like works with local small businesses. So maybe you can like 43 00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:59.519 huda: kind of collaborate with them on that and that way, like you'll get a recommendation and like you'll just like be connected to Sanford somehow. So I I think that's like a really valuable advice. But yeah. 44 00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.039 Jenny Duan: I think that's a really good idea. As well. 45 00:08:03.553 --> 00:08:11.336 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think the biggest 2 things that I wanted to talk about today is talking about the Afasa. So that 46 00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:28.098 Jenny Duan: I say, contest that I mentioned and then starting your camera and impact scholarship application. I wanna make sure that that started pretty early, because that is quite an intense application. It's basically a college application, if if not even more intense. And I wanna make sure that we're off to a good start with that 47 00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:37.459 Jenny Duan: So do. Do you have a preference for which one you would want to focus on today? And have you started thinking about the essay Contest at all. 48 00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:45.081 huda: I haven't written anything for the essay contest. But yeah, I think maybe we can talk a bit more about the camera and impact. 49 00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.000 Jenny Duan: Okay. 50 00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:52.183 Jenny Duan: that seems good. And then the other 2 things that I wanna have on your radar are 51 00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.019 Jenny Duan: I want to. 52 00:08:56.166 --> 00:09:08.669 Jenny Duan: This is. This is like a little bit in the future. So it's gonna be like stuff to do in May. But May is honestly coming up. So it's not that much in the future, but something called the Diana Award. Have you heard about it? 53 00:09:09.517 --> 00:09:10.440 huda: No, I haven't. 54 00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, so 55 00:09:12.857 --> 00:09:16.249 Jenny Duan: this is a an award for people who like 56 00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:24.440 Jenny Duan: it's a charity, and there they help, inspire, pro, inspire positive change in the lives of young people. So 57 00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:48.639 Jenny Duan: it's for people who've like started nonprofits or done some very impactful work. And I think that, like you'd be a good candidate for this. I I just want to, in preparation for applying for this award. I want to really work on like expanding some of your nonprofits and your projects a little bit wider, which is why I think the elementary school toolkit and trying to like get your work in the hands of as many people as possible should be a priority. So. 58 00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:57.730 Jenny Duan: moving backwards. I also want to check on the elementary school toolkit and how that's going. And if I can support you in any way with like brainstorming, putting that together, or anything like that. 59 00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:00.480 huda: Yeah, So 60 00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:05.021 huda: so for the toolkit, are we? So should I. 61 00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.445 huda: kind of like make a slideshow, maybe, or is it more of like 62 00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.190 huda: like? 63 00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.739 huda: I'm not exactly sure like how to go about it, for, like setting it up, you know. 64 00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So let me see. 65 00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.730 Jenny Duan: tricky long toolkit. So I think it would be just best to give like 66 00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.349 Jenny Duan: a Google Doc, and maybe like, also a slideshow. So 67 00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.970 Jenny Duan: let me find an example of a toolkit. 68 00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.910 Jenny Duan: learning 69 00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.340 Jenny Duan: plan, geometry. 70 00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, 1 s. 71 00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.579 Jenny Duan: let me open up a sample lesson plan for you. 72 00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.050 Jenny Duan: Oh, it! 73 00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.629 Jenny Duan: Let me share my screen so you can see this. Can you see my screen. 74 00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.930 huda: Yes. 75 00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:14.649 Jenny Duan: So you can put this all in a document and just make sure that it's I mean, you format it things nicely. So I'm not worried about that, but just give it like lesson plan. We can say, like 76 00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:22.699 Jenny Duan: learning AI with Synthoria, with the Synthoria game, something like call whatever you want right objective lesson objectives. 77 00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.199 Jenny Duan: Give some like. 78 00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:32.820 Jenny Duan: you can connect it to California common core if you want, or maybe your district common core. And then also, maybe if you could find national common core, you can 79 00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.600 Jenny Duan: maybe start with California. And then we can expand across this nation. But then. 80 00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.237 Jenny Duan: like, think about what skills you wanna address 81 00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.639 Jenny Duan: you don't even need to include all this if you don't think it's relevant. But then 82 00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.800 Jenny Duan: just have like 83 00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.690 Jenny Duan: an introduction like. 84 00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.659 Jenny Duan: have the background for the things you want them to teach, and then have a procedure 85 00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.770 Jenny Duan: for how you want them to teach it. 86 00:12:00.144 --> 00:12:03.935 Jenny Duan: This is not a really good lesson plan. Let me see. 87 00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.640 Jenny Duan: plan with 88 00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.900 Jenny Duan: scratch. 89 00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.900 Jenny Duan: Okay? 90 00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.170 Jenny Duan: Call me 91 00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.100 Jenny Duan: okay. 92 00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.210 Jenny Duan: I want to just open this. 93 00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.780 Jenny Duan: Okay. 94 00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:37.250 Jenny Duan: like this. Okay, do you see the objective introduction, and then, like what? How? You're gonna have them run through your game, some challenges. 95 00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.550 Jenny Duan: etc, and then like notes. 96 00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.139 Jenny Duan: And this is like a lesson plan that can make. 97 00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:56.279 huda: Okay, wonderful. And so for like, in terms of trying to reach out and sending it to schools, how do you see? Like the best way to go about that cause. Like I, I could probably find like local ones. But, you know, it's like brought in my reach. 98 00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.185 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think, 99 00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.330 Jenny Duan: let me just write this in the notes first. 100 00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:23.069 Jenny Duan: So I think that the best thing to do is maybe start with your district, because that you have the biggest impact in the schools local to you, and it might be the easiest to kick that off the ground. But then I would start blasting it out to like teachers. Like, if you can just find like, okay, start by sending it to all the Cs. Or like curriculum math. Maybe math teachers, too. 101 00:13:23.495 --> 00:13:29.664 Jenny Duan: In your district, in the elementary schools, and then go to like the nearby districts. And 102 00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:36.859 Jenny Duan: After that you can just look at other districts across the Bay area and then, like across California, and just go like scale it up and up from there. 103 00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:43.100 huda: So just like, kind of like cold email, like a bunch of like teachers, teachers, okay. 104 00:13:43.100 --> 00:14:09.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and say, like, Hi, my name is Khadija. Like I, you can link it to your personal website if you want. And say, like, I am a like game developer, really passionate about like AI and education. I created this game to teach, to help young people learn education in a very to learn AI in a very like fun and user friendly way. And I wanted to share the sample like curriculum that I made in case, you want to integrate it with your existing like lesson plans or something 105 00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.168 Jenny Duan: they can enjoy like that. Yeah. 106 00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.000 huda: Okay. Sounds good. 107 00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.490 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you have any other questions about that? 108 00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:31.170 huda: I think so. I I think that should be fine. And then I could probably like include like empowering AI maybe that the slideshows that we had in case they want to include that as well. 109 00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:57.479 Jenny Duan: Exactly. I think it's a great idea. And I think, for this type of project time is imperative. So I think this should be your priority one, this weekend or this break to try to get this sent out, because for some of the awards and things that I want you to be applying for this summer. It you need to have more numbers. You need to be like, oh, I created something that reached X amount of people, and like the more the better. So because of that, it's important to like, get something like this kicked off the ground. Okay. 110 00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.499 Jenny Duan: And then there's 111 00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.840 Jenny Duan: Me see 112 00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.930 Jenny Duan: another thing that applications. I'm not sure when they're open. 113 00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:14.179 Jenny Duan: but I think it would be cool for you to apply for this, which is called Disney dreamers. Academy. 114 00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.388 Jenny Duan: It's it's another leadership program. And 115 00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.020 Jenny Duan: there's also 116 00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.200 Jenny Duan: 1 s. 117 00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:34.349 Jenny Duan: There's also another organization that does a big award for like general leadership, which is 118 00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.660 Jenny Duan: kind of what I want you to apply for 119 00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.530 Jenny Duan: global team leaders. 120 00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:06.339 Jenny Duan: so there's an organization called, We are family foundation. And I am trying to figure out how you can 121 00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:13.549 Jenny Duan: get involved with this organization. They have. They used to have this program called global team leaders. But I think 122 00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.867 Jenny Duan: they may have 123 00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.989 Jenny Duan: They may have ended the program because I see that they're 124 00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.080 Jenny Duan: their their last class was 2022, which is not. 125 00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.400 huda: Andrew. 126 00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.343 Jenny Duan: Sync, 127 00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.200 Jenny Duan: okay? 128 00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:36.670 Jenny Duan: Oh. 129 00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.300 Jenny Duan: okay, it looks like there are 130 00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:51.210 Jenny Duan: some applications. Can you email them this week and ask them if they are taking when they're taking applications next for 131 00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.100 Jenny Duan: for their youth to the front fund. 132 00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.210 Jenny Duan: No worries. 133 00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:55.843 huda: Weird 134 00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:59.849 Jenny Duan: What? Yeah, for the, we are family foundation. 135 00:17:01.376 --> 00:17:01.773 huda: Okay. 136 00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.339 Jenny Duan: They have a lot of different programs. But 137 00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:14.760 Jenny Duan: I don't know when they're like, I think, just try to get involved with them in any in any way. Here, let me give you their email address. So one of the one thing you should do after this call is just email them 138 00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:15.976 Jenny Duan: and say 139 00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.699 Jenny Duan: and ask them when they're taking like their next cohort. 140 00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.790 huda: Okay. 141 00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.690 Jenny Duan: okay? 142 00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:36.039 Jenny Duan: So before. So basically, the the shift in the past couple of months is working on your summer program applications. But now that 143 00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:53.979 Jenny Duan: the majority of those are in I wanna shift it to the general like leadership scholarship programs that we're going to be going for over the next couple of months. Because, those are, those are gonna be like more acknowledging general leadership and like general change making. And these like really big, impactful words are pretty much like. 144 00:17:54.050 --> 00:18:21.850 Jenny Duan: First of all, they, a lot of them, come with like fully funded scholarships, which is really good, and second of all, they are like, really, really impressive, like global awards. And so it'd be, it would be good if you were eligible or like, had some practice applying to them because their application process is going to be similar to a lot of college applications. And so with that. Now, I think we can go back to the Cameron Impact Scholarship, which is an example of one of these, like really big international awards. 145 00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:23.799 Jenny Duan: So 146 00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.290 Jenny Duan: can you make an account for the Cameron Impact scholarship slash! Have you already done that? 147 00:18:29.047 --> 00:18:30.419 huda: Yeah, I'm gonna 148 00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.920 huda: okay. Good. 149 00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:55.879 Jenny Duan: Then again, the the early application is May twenty-second. But I do want to get this done 150 00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.870 Jenny Duan: a little bit earlier, because it's gonna take a long, long time to do, and you also need recommendations and all of that. 151 00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.090 Jenny Duan: So I think let's ask for recommendations. The week after you get back from break. 152 00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.100 huda: Yeah. 153 00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.630 huda: Also, I don't. I don't really think I should 154 00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.559 huda: trust my computer science teacher anymore. Because. 155 00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 156 00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.229 huda: Still hasn't put in the recommendation, and like 157 00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.239 huda: I've been spamming her this break and last week, so. 158 00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.430 Jenny Duan: She still hasn't put in the recommendation. 159 00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.100 huda: So. 160 00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.715 Jenny Duan: Remind me, which is this? Where G. Stem? Or I ask. 161 00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.740 huda: Them. 162 00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:35.650 huda: I think. 163 00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.610 Jenny Duan: So way. 164 00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:37.990 huda: Yeah. 165 00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.320 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's terrible. 166 00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:52.859 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think for Gstem. It's semi. Okay, because you applied by the early app like you applied by the early application, and there's still a regular deadline. 167 00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.410 huda: Yes. 168 00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.860 Jenny Duan: So that's okay. But 169 00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.610 Jenny Duan: that is really so. I'm really sorry to hear that. 170 00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.863 huda: Yeah, I'm I'm just kind of like 171 00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.479 huda: I I've trusted her with like other ones before. 172 00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.579 Jenny Duan: And she's been okay with those. 173 00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.300 huda: Yeah. 174 00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.979 Jenny Duan: You know, if there's some like, is this a one time thing like, do you know, if there's something 175 00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.579 Jenny Duan: like happening in her personal life that might make it challenging. 176 00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:25.079 huda: Might be because she's also doing remote on. So maybe like she's busy because of that. But. 177 00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.980 Jenny Duan: Love. 178 00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.249 Jenny Duan: Hmm! That's still really tough, though. 179 00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.490 huda: Yeah. 180 00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.020 Jenny Duan: Sorry to hear that. Well. 181 00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.590 Jenny Duan: well, I hope that she gets it in really quickly. 182 00:20:39.297 --> 00:20:43.120 Jenny Duan: Cause that's kind of concerning that. It's already been so long 183 00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.820 Jenny Duan: good to know, though. 184 00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.969 Jenny Duan: Another thing, I think is, it's better to. It's gonna be a good idea to build some like 185 00:20:53.080 --> 00:21:00.150 Jenny Duan: relationship with other adults. So what you're doing with the journalism program, like the new segment is going to be really good. 186 00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.558 Jenny Duan: Are there any other spaces that you feel like you can access where there's a lot of other adults, for example, the 187 00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.999 Jenny Duan: the youth, is it the Youth Council or the Youth leadership group that you're involved in with the. 188 00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:15.449 huda: Yeah. Youth action committee. 189 00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:28.250 huda: yeah, I guess like we do work with. We have like, I guess, like there's like one leader, and her name is Miss Takele. And yeah. So I think I could probably get. 190 00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:49.520 huda: I mean, I feel she's kind of busy because she has like a lot of elections and things going on. But oh, yeah, and I think I don't know if this like really has merit. But there's like like I'm in contact with, like a lot of adults. Through like the game development, like Linkedin, communities. So like, I'm not sure if that really 191 00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.689 huda: don't want them. 192 00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:58.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it's a good idea to try to get more. People who can vouch for you in different situations, who again, like 193 00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.249 Jenny Duan: not only write recommendations, but also like 194 00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.290 Jenny Duan: help. You 195 00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:08.519 Jenny Duan: like help, nominate you for opportunities and and things like that. So I think, like 196 00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:15.649 Jenny Duan: it would be a good idea to try to develop your relationship with the person who runs the Youth Action Committee. And just like. 197 00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.317 Jenny Duan: because for me, I've asked, like adults that have 198 00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:36.690 Jenny Duan: help me institute like that. I've been involved in in leadership councils and things like that to write me letters of recommendation, references for jobs and other opportunities. So I think it'd be good if you like. Try to develop some better relationship with those people as well, not not only your teachers as school, as an alternative. 199 00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:37.570 huda: Yeah. 200 00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.139 Jenny Duan: Okay. 201 00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.060 Jenny Duan: Cool 202 00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.870 Jenny Duan: column. 203 00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.720 Jenny Duan: Well, yes. 204 00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.089 huda: Independent major. I put interactive media game design. 205 00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.760 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good. 206 00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.690 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 207 00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.729 Jenny Duan: Check what? It's emailed to you. And then 208 00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.369 Jenny Duan: you can go from there. 209 00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.063 huda: Okay, yeah. 210 00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.500 huda: okay, I guess it doesn't save. So 211 00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.840 huda: is it just like a web page application. 212 00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.859 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's just one page. Can you copy the questions onto a Google Doc and share that with me? 213 00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.250 huda: Yeah. 214 00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.209 Jenny Duan: Thank you. There's a lot of questions. 215 00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:10.640 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think it's comparable to like, maybe Bank of America. But I think there are more, and they're longer, if I can remember correctly. 216 00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.380 Jenny Duan: Nope, both great. 217 00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.480 Jenny Duan: Alright, thank you so much. 218 00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.730 Jenny Duan: Can you put the link in the chat as well. 219 00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:10.500 huda: Yeah. 220 00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, thank you. 221 00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.170 Jenny Duan: Nice. 222 00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.250 Jenny Duan: Why, I'm on the document. 223 00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:59.410 Jenny Duan: And have you heard back from Bank of America or any of the other programs yet? 224 00:25:59.754 --> 00:26:02.850 huda: Not yet. I think they're coming out like probably 225 00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:11.186 huda: either later this week, or cause it said like late March, so late March or early April. 226 00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.620 huda: Oh, I think we have to choose 2 of the 5 questions so. 227 00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.650 Jenny Duan: Ok, maybe we can. 228 00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:11.620 huda: Olman. 229 00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:16.139 Jenny Duan: Yeah, just put all them for now and and today, we can talk through which ones you want to prioritize. 230 00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, so you need 2 recommendations. 231 00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.850 Jenny Duan: So 232 00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.560 Jenny Duan: let's think about who you wanna submit for your recommendations. 233 00:28:39.931 --> 00:29:05.510 huda: So I honestly think, like my yeah. My cs, teacher, sorry. My chemistry teacher that wrote that. I say about me or not essays sorry recommendation. I feel like that. Recommendation. Oh, is really good cause. I feel like he kind of said stuff like this is the best thing I've had in all my years. And I know a lot of people just say that. But like. 234 00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.050 Jenny Duan: That's really good. 235 00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:07.820 huda: Yeah. 236 00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.469 huda: yeah. I guess I feel like that recommendation was really good. 237 00:29:14.128 --> 00:29:20.359 huda: I can probably like ask him to change it from like, I'll new horns to something else. But yeah. 238 00:29:22.855 --> 00:29:24.640 huda: and maybe like 239 00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.190 huda: for another one 240 00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.940 huda: I could 241 00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.110 huda: so like 242 00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.599 huda: my Spanish teacher who I had last year. 243 00:29:43.371 --> 00:29:45.379 huda: I can try asking her. 244 00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.450 huda: But 245 00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:56.409 huda: like I feel like for an application. It's kind of important like this. Maybe I would want to ask someone that I haven't talked to in a while. 246 00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.030 huda: Bone. 247 00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.720 Jenny Duan: Who's someone who could just write you the strongest. 248 00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.460 Jenny Duan: the strongest one. 249 00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.939 huda: I mean, like. Originally, I would have sent my Cs teacher. But like 250 00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.390 huda: up, if 251 00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.959 huda: I'm okay. I was just writing more. 252 00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay. What was the last time you saw her? Did you talk to her about this in person? 253 00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:26.599 huda: Yeah, she said, just like, like, every single time she kind of says, like, Remind me tomorrow by email, like, I'll do it like. 254 00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.900 huda: yeah. 255 00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.070 Jenny Duan: Hmm! But she hasn't. 256 00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.495 huda: Yeah. 257 00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.310 huda: home. 258 00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.240 huda: Yeah. 259 00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.169 huda: I think I'll like. 260 00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.130 huda: I'll just like, tell her like. 261 00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:49.119 huda: because I told her that she can just copy and paste like the ones that she's written for me before, but like I, I don't understand why she can't. But yeah. 262 00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.760 Jenny Duan: I see. 263 00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.960 Jenny Duan: Okay, 264 00:30:53.990 --> 00:31:02.700 Jenny Duan: okay. So chemistry teacher is one. Who who else were you thinking about? I don't think your Spanish teacher would be maybe in a Co. Any other core subject. Teachers. 265 00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.410 huda: I could so like I could try asking like my English teacher from last year. But 266 00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.720 huda: she's kind of like busy. So 267 00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.880 huda: maybe not. I do have my history teacher. 268 00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:32.480 huda: I think we're. I think she'd be able to write a good one. She doesn't agree to send Pdf stuff. So that's kind of a problem. 269 00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.979 Jenny Duan: Okay, who else would be willing to support you via Pdf. 270 00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.160 huda: Huh! 271 00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.250 huda: Or oh, wait! It could be sent directly to this address. 272 00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.790 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that's also fine. 273 00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:58.143 huda: Maybe I can ask her I'll have to ask her after like a a few in a few weeks, because she's at a trip, and she won't be back in a while. But yeah. 274 00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.810 Jenny Duan: That seems good, though. 275 00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.390 Jenny Duan: yeah. 276 00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.290 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 277 00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.799 huda: Wait for this one? Does it have to be 278 00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.363 huda: teachers or 279 00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.000 huda: cause? 280 00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:19.860 huda: If it's not teachers? And I could probably find, like people from Linkedin that would be able to like write strong, maybe. 281 00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.039 huda: but I don't think this has to be a. 282 00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.100 Jenny Duan: Teacher, but 283 00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:30.160 Jenny Duan: that you doesn't have to be a teacher. It could be something else. But how comfortable would you feel with someone from Linkedin. Do you know them well enough. 284 00:32:31.464 --> 00:32:37.479 huda: Well, so the guy that like, I'm gonna be on like his podcast like, he's very like. 285 00:32:37.640 --> 00:33:06.889 huda: he speaks pretty highly of me like whenever we're on call or like on Linkedin as well. So I feel like he has like a great perception of me, and then also like he has, like access to Linkedin. So he knows, like all the different projects I'm working on and he's been like consistently liking and everything. So I think he knows about like my projects and everything pretty well, and he's also like a pretty good writer. And I think he probably have time to write 286 00:33:07.776 --> 00:33:08.929 huda: they shouldn't. 287 00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.969 Jenny Duan: And so what is his background? Again? 288 00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:32.199 huda: So it's kind of like a t, so he has 2 jobs. So he like is like a teacher. For like English in Japan. But then, he's also like a game developer, like podcast owner who talks about like tech and like startups and stuff like that. 289 00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.889 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good. So he's a teacher, too. 290 00:33:35.383 --> 00:33:39.870 Jenny Duan: So okay, that seems that seems good. Then let's ask him. 291 00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.649 Jenny Duan: the only complicated thing is like he's not directly worked with you, or if he's not like 292 00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.389 Jenny Duan: he's not 293 00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.260 Jenny Duan: He's not directly worked with the or had experience supervising your work. Kelly knows 294 00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.620 Jenny Duan: about you, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but 295 00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.490 Jenny Duan: I do feel like. 296 00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.420 Jenny Duan: I yeah, I just do feel like that is 297 00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.150 Jenny Duan: something concerning 298 00:34:08.103 --> 00:34:11.979 Jenny Duan: would you? Would your history teacher be? Do you think a good 299 00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.319 Jenny Duan: fit for you? Do you think that she would write a but a good one, or do you think she would not. 300 00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:25.820 huda: I think she probably wrote a good one. I mean she's written like 2 for me before 301 00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:45.083 huda: but I'm not sure if, like it was good or not, because she hasn't really like. She has a good perception of me and she's like like we've been together kind of for like 2 years like she's Tommy for ap hug, and now a push. So she's seen me like persevering through her class. But 302 00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.889 huda: Like I don't know. I kind of find a fishy that she won't. I mean, not fishy, but like 303 00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:57.860 huda: like interesting, that she won't like send the Pdf. So like. 304 00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:03.059 huda: yeah. So maybe she's just being like brutally honest. Or she's just like, not comfortable with it. But yeah. 305 00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.296 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's okay. Then let's ask the then let's ask the 306 00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.990 Jenny Duan: the the Linkedin person. 307 00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:14.599 Jenny Duan: Can you make a note to send them a message and then tell them that they don't have to send it to you directly to 308 00:35:15.025 --> 00:35:17.650 Jenny Duan: also email it if they want to. 309 00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.150 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, let's ask them. 310 00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:27.970 Jenny Duan: Okay, then let's look at these questions and 311 00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.080 Jenny Duan: pick one of them. So it's out of these. 312 00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.930 Jenny Duan: How many do you get to choose from? Is it 12 through 17, or which 5. 313 00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.720 huda: It's from 314 00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.384 huda: the unlimited funding part. 315 00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:49.690 huda: wait. 316 00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.240 huda: I think this you have to choose to from. 317 00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.340 huda: 11 318 00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:07.880 huda: for 15. 319 00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.070 Jenny Duan: Okay? 11 to 15. Okay. 320 00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.630 Jenny Duan: okay. 321 00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.109 Jenny Duan: If you were given unlimited support and funding. 322 00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:25.459 Jenny Duan: how would you share an experience you have had? 323 00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.760 Jenny Duan: Have you written a question in response to this before, or something similar. 324 00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:43.560 huda: I think it's kind of similar to the one from Bank of America about like like making education like tutors and stuff more accessible. But yeah, I don't. 325 00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.440 huda: Yeah. 326 00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.210 Jenny Duan: Okay. 327 00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.350 Jenny Duan: this one is a good one to write about. I think this one, you can write something about games. 328 00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.300 Jenny Duan: Think that would be a really good 329 00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.530 Jenny Duan: I say. 330 00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:12.089 huda: I normally feel like this would be like some an essay that I'd want to write about. 331 00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.720 Jenny Duan: You don't feel like it would be. 332 00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.600 huda: Yeah. 333 00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.899 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. That's not an issue. 334 00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:21.260 Jenny Duan: Any other ones that you feel like you would want to write about anything that stands out to you. 335 00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.076 huda: always are really good. 336 00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.913 Jenny Duan: I feel like this one at 12 and 13 are too similar. So I wouldn't write about 12 if you're gonna write about 13, 337 00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.169 Jenny Duan: So 14 or 11 are also kind of so 14 or 11. Which one do you think. 338 00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.069 Jenny Duan: Sounds like pretty good. You can write about folklore. Yeah. 339 00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:53.660 huda: Yeah. 340 00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:00.100 huda: yeah, I think also, a lot of people probably choose number 14. This is like the 341 00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.440 huda: like overcoming adversity type of question. 342 00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.260 Jenny Duan: Right? 343 00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.500 Jenny Duan: Okay. Now, let's so, I think these are like some pretty good 344 00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:20.039 Jenny Duan: essay example. These are some pretty good essay examples of like what you might be expected to write during a college application as well, like the type of thinking and the type of writing that you will need to demonstrate. 345 00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.609 Jenny Duan: okay, 1, 2, and 3 are pretty straightforward. 346 00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.690 Jenny Duan: 5. You can just answer pretty straightforward. Lee. 347 00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.289 Jenny Duan: 7. You can also 348 00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.260 Jenny Duan: 7. What do you for? 6. What do you plan to write? 349 00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.020 Jenny Duan: Oops? Yeah. 6. 350 00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:46.639 Jenny Duan: I think this one let's focus on like highlighting your impact in some way. So like, what? How do you see yourself making an impact in the world through your career. 351 00:38:48.822 --> 00:38:50.450 huda: So I think 352 00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.126 huda: I could probably talk about 353 00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.071 huda: like game development. And 354 00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.809 huda: you know. 355 00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:19.940 huda: maybe like I wanted to like, leave a story in into it. I'd probably talk about like how many of like people that I know like my acquaintances like family members. They're like really fidgety, and they they can like learn in some some ways. But then I've taken like 356 00:39:20.345 --> 00:39:36.144 huda: I've taken like games and other. I feel like I'm kind of reusing my comment at the story. But, I've taken games, and, like other forms of like storytelling, to transform like learning into a fun thing. And 357 00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:42.469 huda: I think maybe like I envision myself growing this in the future. 358 00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:49.839 huda: I feel like it's kind of like, really basic. So I wanna come up with like a better framing that. 359 00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:51.480 Jenny Duan: But way. 360 00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.680 Jenny Duan: yeah. 361 00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.500 Jenny Duan: also, one 362 00:39:55.090 --> 00:40:00.407 Jenny Duan: huge thing. I do really want to highlight really quickly. Before I interrupt too much. 363 00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:11.661 Jenny Duan: okay, this is something. I I think I've mentioned this a couple of times in the past, but the deadline is approaching, and I really want you to submit synthia to this. 364 00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.330 Jenny Duan: okay, read it. 365 00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.140 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's gonna load. 366 00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:16.160 huda: Yeah. 367 00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.350 Jenny Duan: Okay. 368 00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:36.169 Jenny Duan: Until April fifteenth, students are invited to submit their original games.

So if you have parent, it's fine. 372 00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.239 Jenny Duan: game must be playable on a web browser and accessible via a yeah. URL, 373 00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:56.569 Jenny Duan: it's already done. Okay, scroll down. 374 00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:01.230 Jenny Duan: See the rest of the eligibility. Okay. 375 00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.230 Jenny Duan: okay, you have. You don't need a teacher. You can have parent consent. That's fine. 376 00:41:06.733 --> 00:41:07.619 Jenny Duan: And then 377 00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:10.540 Jenny Duan: make a documentation about your 378 00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.210 Jenny Duan: a video walkthrough of your game. 379 00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:14.180 Jenny Duan: Okay? 380 00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:15.429 Jenny Duan: And then. 381 00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.070 Jenny Duan: is your game made in unity or not? 382 00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:19.990 huda: Yep. 383 00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.860 Jenny Duan: Okay, you can. So you can submit to the different. 384 00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.719 Jenny Duan: the different categories. Let me look at the categories they have this year. 385 00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.239 huda: Oh, I think I I think I remember I'm setting like 386 00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.500 huda: starting the submission so like. 387 00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:41.200 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is, I think, that I think you can win this like, I think you have a very high shot of learning this. 388 00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:47.679 Jenny Duan: or like winning, or at least like winning some type of recognition like honor mentioned like a placement or recognition. Something. 389 00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:58.819 Jenny Duan: I think camera impact might be more tough, but I think it's a good exercise for you to go through like writing all those essays. But I do think camera impact is going to be tough for anyone. 390 00:41:59.272 --> 00:42:03.919 Jenny Duan: There's also, in my opinion, like a little bit of nepotism within camera impact 391 00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:13.733 Jenny Duan: that's on a separate note. But I do think that that's that's gonna be harder to win. I think this is very. This should be like a big priority for you, because I think it's like very 392 00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:20.699 Jenny Duan: I don't know feasible. So the categories that I think you could win are made with unity 393 00:42:21.233 --> 00:42:25.470 Jenny Duan: in and game of the year and character design challenge. 394 00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.770 Jenny Duan: I don't think you'd talk about climate change, ocean or 395 00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.449 Jenny Duan: recycling the runway. 396 00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.320 Jenny Duan: but 397 00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.082 Jenny Duan: I do think you have like really good 398 00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:51.358 Jenny Duan: you have a good chance of winning the best game and also the character design challenge, and also the 399 00:42:52.140 --> 00:43:04.399 Jenny Duan: the made with unity. If you want, you can also submit the to the writing competition. The writing is 500 to 7,750 words, and it's a writing a game review 400 00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:10.750 Jenny Duan: of games from their arcade. Let me show you their game. Arcade. Really quickly. 401 00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:17.060 Jenny Duan: this is all detailed on their on their price list. But 402 00:43:17.853 --> 00:43:23.920 Jenny Duan: basically play a game and review it. I think that should be pretty fun. 750 words is not that much? 403 00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.709 Jenny Duan: It's less than a thousand words. 404 00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.919 Jenny Duan: and just like pick one of their games, play it and review it. Yeah. 405 00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:37.809 huda: Amazing. Oh, so with the with the like. The writing composition does that have, like some sort of like recognition or. 406 00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, it's called the impact Game Writing challenge. And you would also win an award. 407 00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.030 huda: Okay. Cool. 408 00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:54.330 Jenny Duan: Okay. But I wanna give this like a big priority because it's low. It's low lift for you like, you don't have to do that much just film the tutorial like which you might already have. Do you already have a walkthrough. 409 00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.040 huda: Yeah. 410 00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:01.590 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Maybe like, you can look through it. See if there's anything you want to add to it and then just submit it. Like that's it. Okay? 411 00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:07.019 Jenny Duan: So I think games for change is a really good career choice. So let me write that. 412 00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:30.783 huda: Yeah, also. I think I'm gonna apply again to the women and games Ambassador. So I did. I I did like reach out to the lady who's in charge of the admission and everything. So she said. There's like a new window now. I must have like applied with during a time where the window wasn't open. So like, I guess I'm gonna like, apply again. See if 413 00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.529 huda: like. I get any responses this time. 414 00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems like a really good idea. 415 00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:40.509 Jenny Duan: So games for change is the answer. Number 6, what makes you you? 416 00:44:41.072 --> 00:44:45.650 Jenny Duan: I think this you can be like. It can be like 3 sentences 417 00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:46.740 Jenny Duan: like. 418 00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.880 Jenny Duan: for example, my unwavering commitment to 419 00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:53.919 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 420 00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:06.659 Jenny Duan: like shaping environmental change my passion for late night. Karaoke. 421 00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:07.890 Jenny Duan: my 422 00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:13.769 Jenny Duan: like, you need 3 chain. 3 sentences. Have 2 of them be serious, and one of them be a personality sentence. 423 00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:14.420 huda: Okay. 424 00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.169 Jenny Duan: I think that's gonna be good. 425 00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:17.960 huda: Okay. 426 00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.330 Jenny Duan: too serious 427 00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.990 Jenny Duan: one pistol. 428 00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:25.960 Jenny Duan: Okay. 429 00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:34.729 Jenny Duan: I think that this is a probably a good place to pause for today. I think that. Okay? So to recap the biggest priorities right now 430 00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.869 Jenny Duan: submit the foreign service essay competition thing. 431 00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:53.040 Jenny Duan: let's do April first. So you have like this break to work on it. Games for change. Get the game submission in as soon as possible. That should be pretty low lift, since you already have most materials. 432 00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.380 Jenny Duan: Third thing. Get your elementary school toolkit out. 433 00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:15.389 Jenny Duan: After the break. We can talk about this camera impacting we have until May. So we can, we're just gonna continuously work on this. But after the next time we meet I want to like, maybe check in on your foreign service exchange like that. Say competition. And then I also want to check in on the status of 434 00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:22.900 Jenny Duan: we can brainstorm what you're gonna write after you choose a game and play it for the games for change, like writing, competition. 435 00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:34.749 huda: I could. I could probably start writing like a review as well like, maybe if since I don't really have anything to work on right now. I could start writing the review, maybe, and send it over if you have time, like. 436 00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:47.580 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, that sounds perfect. Yeah. And just I mean, it's fun like, play game. Write a review, you know, and the review short, only 7 50 words. So not too much. But biggest thing is, get the foreign service thing in and then work on the toolkit. 437 00:46:47.600 --> 00:47:02.709 Jenny Duan: I think the focus is like, we are really getting to expand your impact a lot as we like level up the award that we're applying for over the next year. So we just need to get some concrete numbers in terms of like, how many people you're impacting and like, at what scale. So that's to be really important. 438 00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:03.900 huda: Okay. 439 00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.859 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool any other questions. 440 00:47:06.933 --> 00:47:08.600 huda: No, that's all for now. 441 00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:19.399 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like I push a lot of on you today like a lot of things. So if you get feel confused about anything. Just send me a text, and I can like help you, or if you have any essays, just send them to me, and I can look at them. 442 00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.230 huda: Alright, yeah. Sounds good.

Awesome. 13 00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.960 huda: Yeah, what do you. 14 00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.660 Jenny Duan: Have you been up to during the break. 15 00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:08.048 huda: So my sister came back from color. So I've been spending a little bit of time with her. And 16 00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.779 huda: yeah, so like, I guess we haven't done much, but I think I'm I'm gonna try and get my permit this break. So. 17 00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:25.619 Jenny Duan: Oh, good luck! That's super exciting! I remember when I got my permit for the first time, too, was super nervous. But I think if you do like. If you read the manual and do the practice test online, then you'll be fine. 18 00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:37.440 Jenny Duan: I'll actually peep your comment up document earlier today. How did",
    " that? How did writing those feel? And do you have any reflections? After preparing all of that and getting to practice it. 19 00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:55.520 huda: Yeah, I definitely say, like, some of them are fine. But like I wouldn't say like the Esses were my best work. And they also didn't really like go up to like the word limit. And I think I just kind of like rushed a few of them. But then I did definitely brainstorm some good ideas and like 20 00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:05.680 huda: kind of connections throughout. I think just like thinking about stories where it was pretty meaningful, and like thinking about how to respond to each question. 21 00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.120 Jenny Duan: Did your teacher give you feed any feedback yet, or not? Yet. 22 00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.370 huda: Not yet. 23 00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:20.040 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that that totally makes sense, especially given that you know you were supposed to write 5 common apps in a couple of days, which is absolutely crazy. But yeah. 24 00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.260 Jenny Duan: And then, 25 00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.450 Jenny Duan: so couple of the brief things, were you able to meet with your vice president or yeah, your vice principal. And how's that going. 26 00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:42.909 huda: So, oh, yeah, also, I forgot, I have like an update. So for student use, I decided, I, I'm gonna start a new segment where I'm gonna be interviewing new like the school Admins, and kind of getting to know them and like what they do behind. 27 00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.540 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's so perfect! That is such a get to know them, too, and set a impression. 28 00:05:48.940 --> 00:06:13.000 huda: Yeah. So so like I said, I like brainstormed a few questions with them on a dog, and then I'll message my vice principal. I was like, oh, I'd love to get to meet you and like get to know you. I'm starting a new segment. I'd love to interview you. And yeah. So I I set up a meeting. It should be on Monda",
    "y. But like I need her like to double confirm. But yeah. 29 00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.830 Jenny Duan: Really good, and that is such a smart, smart strategy. Who did like. 30 00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.336 huda: Thank you. 31 00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:26.540 Jenny Duan: Meet all your admin, given them a positive impression. And yeah, okay, was your empowering AI last session this today, or is it tomorrow? 32 00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:31.070 huda: I think we're gonna be postoning it to tomorrow. 33 00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.230 Jenny Duan: Okay. 34 00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.590 Jenny Duan: to, tomorrow. 35 00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.370 huda: Yeah. 36 00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.340 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 37 00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.890 Jenny Duan: Let me make a note of that. 38 00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.980 Jenny Duan: Institution goes from to tomorrow. 39 00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:48.969 Jenny Duan: Did you set up the call with the nonprofit marketing? Guy? 40 00:06:49.270 --> 00:07:12.770 huda: Yeah, so he was. Talk about like, kind of like, how hard was it for you to start? Set up an initiative and everything. And so he's like a senior he has, like a really successful organization from like many different chapters around the country and stuff. And so like. I was also asking advice like, How do you grow your nonprofit so that it has like more reach and stuff, and 41 00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:23.280 huda: So for folklift he gave like suggestions so like obviously to like collaborate with like pre-existing initiatives. And so he's he like 42 00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:48.259 huda: kind of suggested. I think I don't remember if he said I think he said, Chamber of Commerce so like, since they're like small businesses. They'd like be in contact with many and then he also said, like he asked me like, Oh, what college you really want to go to? And I said, Sanford. So then he was like, I'm sure Stanford has, like some sort of club or program which like works with local small businesses. So ",
    "maybe you can like 43 00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:59.519 huda: kind of collaborate with them on that and that way, like you'll get a recommendation and like you'll just like be connected to Sanford somehow. So I I think that's like a really valuable advice. But yeah. 44 00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.039 Jenny Duan: I think that's a really good idea. As well. 45 00:08:03.553 --> 00:08:11.336 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think the biggest 2 things that I wanted to talk about today is talking about the Afasa. So that 46 00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:28.098 Jenny Duan: I say, contest that I mentioned and then starting your camera and impact scholarship application. I wanna make sure that that started pretty early, because that is quite an intense application. It's basically a college application, if if not even more intense. And I wanna make sure that we're off to a good start with that 47 00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:37.459 Jenny Duan: So do. Do you have a preference for which one you would want to focus on today? And have you started thinking about the essay Contest at all. 48 00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:45.081 huda: I haven't written anything for the essay contest. But yeah, I think maybe we can talk a bit more about the camera and impact. 49 00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.000 Jenny Duan: Okay. 50 00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:52.183 Jenny Duan: that seems good. And then the other 2 things that I wanna have on your radar are 51 00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.019 Jenny Duan: I want to. 52 00:08:56.166 --> 00:09:08.669 Jenny Duan: This is. This is like a little bit in the future. So it's gonna be like stuff to do in May. But May is honestly coming up. So it's not that much in the future, but something called the Diana Award. Have you heard about it? 53 00:09:09.517 --> 00:09:10.440 huda: No, I haven't. 54 00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, so 55 00:09:12.857 --> 00:09:16.249 Jenny Duan: this is a an award for people who like 56 00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:24.440 Jenny Duan: it's a charity, and there they help,",
    " inspire, pro, inspire positive change in the lives of young people. So 57 00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:48.639 Jenny Duan: it's for people who've like started nonprofits or done some very impactful work. And I think that, like you'd be a good candidate for this. I I just want to, in preparation for applying for this award. I want to really work on like expanding some of your nonprofits and your projects a little bit wider, which is why I think the elementary school toolkit and trying to like get your work in the hands of as many people as possible should be a priority. So. 58 00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:57.730 Jenny Duan: moving backwards. I also want to check on the elementary school toolkit and how that's going. And if I can support you in any way with like brainstorming, putting that together, or anything like that. 59 00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:00.480 huda: Yeah, So 60 00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:05.021 huda: so for the toolkit, are we? So should I. 61 00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.445 huda: kind of like make a slideshow, maybe, or is it more of like 62 00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.190 huda: like? 63 00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.739 huda: I'm not exactly sure like how to go about it, for, like setting it up, you know. 64 00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So let me see. 65 00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.730 Jenny Duan: tricky long toolkit. So I think it would be just best to give like 66 00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.349 Jenny Duan: a Google Doc, and maybe like, also a slideshow. So 67 00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.970 Jenny Duan: let me find an example of a toolkit. 68 00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.910 Jenny Duan: learning 69 00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.340 Jenny Duan: plan, geometry. 70 00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, 1 s. 71 00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.579 Jenny Duan: let me open up a sample lesson plan for you. 72 00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.050 Jenny Duan: Oh, it! 73 00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.629 Jenny Duan: Let me share my screen so you can see this. Can you see my screen. 74 00:",
    "11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.930 huda: Yes. 75 00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:14.649 Jenny Duan: So you can put this all in a document and just make sure that it's I mean, you format it things nicely. So I'm not worried about that, but just give it like lesson plan. We can say, like 76 00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:22.699 Jenny Duan: learning AI with Synthoria, with the Synthoria game, something like call whatever you want right objective lesson objectives. 77 00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.199 Jenny Duan: Give some like. 78 00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:32.820 Jenny Duan: you can connect it to California common core if you want, or maybe your district common core. And then also, maybe if you could find national common core, you can 79 00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.600 Jenny Duan: maybe start with California. And then we can expand across this nation. But then. 80 00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.237 Jenny Duan: like, think about what skills you wanna address 81 00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.639 Jenny Duan: you don't even need to include all this if you don't think it's relevant. But then 82 00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.800 Jenny Duan: just have like 83 00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.690 Jenny Duan: an introduction like. 84 00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.659 Jenny Duan: have the background for the things you want them to teach, and then have a procedure 85 00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.770 Jenny Duan: for how you want them to teach it. 86 00:12:00.144 --> 00:12:03.935 Jenny Duan: This is not a really good lesson plan. Let me see. 87 00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.640 Jenny Duan: plan with 88 00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.900 Jenny Duan: scratch. 89 00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.900 Jenny Duan: Okay? 90 00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.170 Jenny Duan: Call me 91 00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.100 Jenny Duan: okay. 92 00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.210 Jenny Duan: I want to just open this. 93 00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.780 Jenny Duan: Okay. 94 00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:37.250 Jenny Duan: like this. Okay, do you see the objective introduction, and then, like what? H",
    "ow? You're gonna have them run through your game, some challenges. 95 00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.550 Jenny Duan: etc, and then like notes. 96 00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.139 Jenny Duan: And this is like a lesson plan that can make. 97 00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:56.279 huda: Okay, wonderful. And so for like, in terms of trying to reach out and sending it to schools, how do you see? Like the best way to go about that cause. Like I, I could probably find like local ones. But, you know, it's like brought in my reach. 98 00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.185 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think, 99 00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.330 Jenny Duan: let me just write this in the notes first. 100 00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:23.069 Jenny Duan: So I think that the best thing to do is maybe start with your district, because that you have the biggest impact in the schools local to you, and it might be the easiest to kick that off the ground. But then I would start blasting it out to like teachers. Like, if you can just find like, okay, start by sending it to all the Cs. Or like curriculum math. Maybe math teachers, too. 101 00:13:23.495 --> 00:13:29.664 Jenny Duan: In your district, in the elementary schools, and then go to like the nearby districts. And 102 00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:36.859 Jenny Duan: After that you can just look at other districts across the Bay area and then, like across California, and just go like scale it up and up from there. 103 00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:43.100 huda: So just like, kind of like cold email, like a bunch of like teachers, teachers, okay. 104 00:13:43.100 --> 00:14:09.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and say, like, Hi, my name is Khadija. Like I, you can link it to your personal website if you want. And say, like, I am a like game developer, really passionate about like AI and education. I created this game to teach, to help young people learn education in a very to learn AI in a very like fun and user friendly way. And I wanted to share the sample like curriculum that I made in case, you wan",
    "t to integrate it with your existing like lesson plans or something 105 00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.168 Jenny Duan: they can enjoy like that. Yeah. 106 00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.000 huda: Okay. Sounds good. 107 00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.490 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you have any other questions about that? 108 00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:31.170 huda: I think so. I I think that should be fine. And then I could probably like include like empowering AI maybe that the slideshows that we had in case they want to include that as well. 109 00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:57.479 Jenny Duan: Exactly. I think it's a great idea. And I think, for this type of project time is imperative. So I think this should be your priority one, this weekend or this break to try to get this sent out, because for some of the awards and things that I want you to be applying for this summer. It you need to have more numbers. You need to be like, oh, I created something that reached X amount of people, and like the more the better. So because of that, it's important to like, get something like this kicked off the ground. Okay. 110 00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.499 Jenny Duan: And then there's 111 00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.840 Jenny Duan: Me see 112 00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.930 Jenny Duan: another thing that applications. I'm not sure when they're open. 113 00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:14.179 Jenny Duan: but I think it would be cool for you to apply for this, which is called Disney dreamers. Academy. 114 00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.388 Jenny Duan: It's it's another leadership program. And 115 00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.020 Jenny Duan: there's also 116 00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.200 Jenny Duan: 1 s. 117 00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:34.349 Jenny Duan: There's also another organization that does a big award for like general leadership, which is 118 00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.660 Jenny Duan: kind of what I want you to apply for 119 00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.530 Jenny Duan: global team leaders. 120 00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:06.339 Jenny Duan: so",
    " there's an organization called, We are family foundation. And I am trying to figure out how you can 121 00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:13.549 Jenny Duan: get involved with this organization. They have. They used to have this program called global team leaders. But I think 122 00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.867 Jenny Duan: they may have 123 00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.989 Jenny Duan: They may have ended the program because I see that they're 124 00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.080 Jenny Duan: their their last class was 2022, which is not. 125 00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.400 huda: Andrew. 126 00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.343 Jenny Duan: Sync, 127 00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.200 Jenny Duan: okay? 128 00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:36.670 Jenny Duan: Oh. 129 00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.300 Jenny Duan: okay, it looks like there are 130 00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:51.210 Jenny Duan: some applications. Can you email them this week and ask them if they are taking when they're taking applications next for 131 00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.100 Jenny Duan: for their youth to the front fund. 132 00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.210 Jenny Duan: No worries. 133 00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:55.843 huda: Weird 134 00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:59.849 Jenny Duan: What? Yeah, for the, we are family foundation. 135 00:17:01.376 --> 00:17:01.773 huda: Okay. 136 00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.339 Jenny Duan: They have a lot of different programs. But 137 00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:14.760 Jenny Duan: I don't know when they're like, I think, just try to get involved with them in any in any way. Here, let me give you their email address. So one of the one thing you should do after this call is just email them 138 00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:15.976 Jenny Duan: and say 139 00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.699 Jenny Duan: and ask them when they're taking like their next cohort. 140 00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.790 huda: Okay. 141 00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.690 Jenny Duan: okay? 142 00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:36.039 Jenny Duan: So before. So basically, the the shift in the past couple o",
    "f months is working on your summer program applications. But now that 143 00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:53.979 Jenny Duan: the majority of those are in I wanna shift it to the general like leadership scholarship programs that we're going to be going for over the next couple of months. Because, those are, those are gonna be like more acknowledging general leadership and like general change making. And these like really big, impactful words are pretty much like. 144 00:17:54.050 --> 00:18:21.850 Jenny Duan: First of all, they, a lot of them, come with like fully funded scholarships, which is really good, and second of all, they are like, really, really impressive, like global awards. And so it'd be, it would be good if you were eligible or like, had some practice applying to them because their application process is going to be similar to a lot of college applications. And so with that. Now, I think we can go back to the Cameron Impact Scholarship, which is an example of one of these, like really big international awards. 145 00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:23.799 Jenny Duan: So 146 00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.290 Jenny Duan: can you make an account for the Cameron Impact scholarship slash! Have you already done that? 147 00:18:29.047 --> 00:18:30.419 huda: Yeah, I'm gonna 148 00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.920 huda: okay. Good. 149 00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:55.879 Jenny Duan: Then again, the the early application is May twenty-second. But I do want to get this done 150 00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.870 Jenny Duan: a little bit earlier, because it's gonna take a long, long time to do, and you also need recommendations and all of that. 151 00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.090 Jenny Duan: So I think let's ask for recommendations. The week after you get back from break. 152 00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.100 huda: Yeah. 153 00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.630 huda: Also, I don't. I don't really think I should 154 00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.559 huda: trust my computer science teacher anymore. Because. 155 00:19:17.870 -",
    "-> 00:19:18.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 156 00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.229 huda: Still hasn't put in the recommendation, and like 157 00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.239 huda: I've been spamming her this break and last week, so. 158 00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.430 Jenny Duan: She still hasn't put in the recommendation. 159 00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.100 huda: So. 160 00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.715 Jenny Duan: Remind me, which is this? Where G. Stem? Or I ask. 161 00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.740 huda: Them. 162 00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:35.650 huda: I think. 163 00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.610 Jenny Duan: So way. 164 00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:37.990 huda: Yeah. 165 00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.320 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's terrible. 166 00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:52.859 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think for Gstem. It's semi. Okay, because you applied by the early app like you applied by the early application, and there's still a regular deadline. 167 00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.410 huda: Yes. 168 00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.860 Jenny Duan: So that's okay. But 169 00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.610 Jenny Duan: that is really so. I'm really sorry to hear that. 170 00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.863 huda: Yeah, I'm I'm just kind of like 171 00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.479 huda: I I've trusted her with like other ones before. 172 00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.579 Jenny Duan: And she's been okay with those. 173 00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.300 huda: Yeah. 174 00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.979 Jenny Duan: You know, if there's some like, is this a one time thing like, do you know, if there's something 175 00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.579 Jenny Duan: like happening in her personal life that might make it challenging. 176 00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:25.079 huda: Might be because she's also doing remote on. So maybe like she's busy because of that. But. 177 00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.980 Jenny Duan: Love. 178 00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.249 Jenny Duan: Hmm! That's still really tough, though. 179 00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.490 huda: Yeah. 180 00:20:33.060 --> ",
    "00:20:35.020 Jenny Duan: Sorry to hear that. Well. 181 00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.590 Jenny Duan: well, I hope that she gets it in really quickly. 182 00:20:39.297 --> 00:20:43.120 Jenny Duan: Cause that's kind of concerning that. It's already been so long 183 00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.820 Jenny Duan: good to know, though. 184 00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.969 Jenny Duan: Another thing, I think is, it's better to. It's gonna be a good idea to build some like 185 00:20:53.080 --> 00:21:00.150 Jenny Duan: relationship with other adults. So what you're doing with the journalism program, like the new segment is going to be really good. 186 00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.558 Jenny Duan: Are there any other spaces that you feel like you can access where there's a lot of other adults, for example, the 187 00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.999 Jenny Duan: the youth, is it the Youth Council or the Youth leadership group that you're involved in with the. 188 00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:15.449 huda: Yeah. Youth action committee. 189 00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:28.250 huda: yeah, I guess like we do work with. We have like, I guess, like there's like one leader, and her name is Miss Takele. And yeah. So I think I could probably get. 190 00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:49.520 huda: I mean, I feel she's kind of busy because she has like a lot of elections and things going on. But oh, yeah, and I think I don't know if this like really has merit. But there's like like I'm in contact with, like a lot of adults. Through like the game development, like Linkedin, communities. So like, I'm not sure if that really 191 00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.689 huda: don't want them. 192 00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:58.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it's a good idea to try to get more. People who can vouch for you in different situations, who again, like 193 00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.249 Jenny Duan: not only write recommendations, but also like 194 00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.290 Jenny Duan: help. You 195 00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:08.519 Jenny Duan: ",
    "like help, nominate you for opportunities and and things like that. So I think, like 196 00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:15.649 Jenny Duan: it would be a good idea to try to develop your relationship with the person who runs the Youth Action Committee. And just like. 197 00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.317 Jenny Duan: because for me, I've asked, like adults that have 198 00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:36.690 Jenny Duan: help me institute like that. I've been involved in in leadership councils and things like that to write me letters of recommendation, references for jobs and other opportunities. So I think it'd be good if you like. Try to develop some better relationship with those people as well, not not only your teachers as school, as an alternative. 199 00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:37.570 huda: Yeah. 200 00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.139 Jenny Duan: Okay. 201 00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.060 Jenny Duan: Cool 202 00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.870 Jenny Duan: column. 203 00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.720 Jenny Duan: Well, yes. 204 00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.089 huda: Independent major. I put interactive media game design. 205 00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.760 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good. 206 00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.690 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 207 00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.729 Jenny Duan: Check what? It's emailed to you. And then 208 00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.369 Jenny Duan: you can go from there. 209 00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.063 huda: Okay, yeah. 210 00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.500 huda: okay, I guess it doesn't save. So 211 00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.840 huda: is it just like a web page application. 212 00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.859 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's just one page. Can you copy the questions onto a Google Doc and share that with me? 213 00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.250 huda: Yeah. 214 00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.209 Jenny Duan: Thank you. There's a lot of questions. 215 00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:10.640 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think it's comparable to like, maybe Bank of America. But I think there are more, and",

My cs, teacher, sorry. My chemistry teacher that wrote that. I say about me or not essays sorry recommendation. I feel like that. Recommendation. Oh, is really good cause. I feel like he kind of said stuff like this is the best thing I've had in all my years. And I know a lot of people just say that. But like. 234 00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.050 Jenny Duan: That's really good. 235 00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:07.820 huda: Yeah. 236 00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.469 huda: yeah. I guess I ",

But yeah. 238 00:29:22.855 --> 00:29:24.640 huda: and maybe like 239 00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.190 huda: for another one 240 00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.940 huda: I could 241 00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.110 huda: so like 242 00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.599 huda: my Spanish teacher who I had last year. 243 00:29:43.371 --> 00:29:45.379 huda: I can try asking her. 244 00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.450 huda: But 245 00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:56.409 huda: like I feel like for an application. It's kind of important like this. Maybe I would want to ask someone that I haven't talked to in a while. 246 00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.030 huda: Bone. 247 00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.720 Jenny Duan: Who's someone who could just write you the strongest. 248 00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.460 Jenny Duan: the strongest one. 249 00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.939 huda: I mean, like. Originally, I would have sent my Cs teacher. But like 250 00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.390 huda: up, if 251 00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.959 huda: I'm okay. I was just writing more. 252 00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay. What was the last time you saw her? Did you talk to her about this in person? 253 00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:26.599 huda: Yeah, she said, just like, like, every single time she kind of says, like, Remind me tomorrow by email, like, I'll do it like. 254 00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.900 huda: yeah. 255 00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.070 Jenny Duan: Hmm!

    "written for me before, but like I, I don't understand why she can't. But yeah. 262 00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.760 Jenny Duan: I see. 263 00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.960 Jenny Duan: Okay, 264 00:30:53.990 --> 00:31:02.700 Jenny Duan: okay. So chemistry teacher is one. Who who else were you thinking about? I don't think your Spanish teacher would be maybe in a Co. Any other core subject. Teachers. 265 00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.410 huda: I could so like I could try asking like my English teacher from last year. But 266 00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.720 huda: she's kind of like busy. So 267 00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.880 huda: maybe not. I do have my history teacher. 268 00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:32.480 huda: I think we're. I think she'd be able to write a good one. She doesn't agree to send Pdf stuff. So that's kind of a problem. 269 00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.979 Jenny Duan: Okay, who else would be willing to support you via Pdf. 270 00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.160 huda: Huh! 271 00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.250 huda: Or oh, wait! It could be sent directly to this address. 272 00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.790 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that's also fine. 273 00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:58.143 huda: Maybe I can ask her I'll have to ask her after like a a few in a few weeks, because she's at a trip, and she won't be back in a while. But yeah. 274 00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.810 Jenny Duan: That seems good, though. 275 00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.390 Jenny Duan: yeah. 276 00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.290 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 277 00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.799 huda: Wait for this one? Does it have to be 278 00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.363 huda: teachers or 279 00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.000 huda: cause? 280 00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:19.860 huda: If it's not teachers? And I could probably find, like people from Linkedin that would be able to like write strong, maybe. 281 00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.039 huda: but I don't think this has to be a. 282 00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.100 Jenny Duan: Teacher, but 283 00:32:23.6",
    "70 --> 00:32:30.160 Jenny Duan: that you doesn't have to be a teacher. It could be something else. But how comfortable would you feel with someone from Linkedin. Do you know them well enough. 284 00:32:31.464 --> 00:32:37.479 huda: Well, so the guy that like, I'm gonna be on like his podcast like, he's very like. 285 00:32:37.640 --> 00:33:06.889 huda: he speaks pretty highly of me like whenever we're on call or like on Linkedin as well. So I feel like he has like a great perception of me, and then also like he has, like access to Linkedin. So he knows, like all the different projects I'm working on and he's been like consistently liking and everything. So I think he knows about like my projects and everything pretty well, and he's also like a pretty good writer. And I think he probably have time to write 286 00:33:07.776 --> 00:33:08.929 huda: they shouldn't. 287 00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.969 Jenny Duan: And so what is his background? Again? 288 00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:32.199 huda: So it's kind of like a t, so he has 2 jobs. So he like is like a teacher. For like English in Japan. But then, he's also like a game developer, like podcast owner who talks about like tech and like startups and stuff like that. 289 00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.889 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good. So he's a teacher, too. 290 00:33:35.383 --> 00:33:39.870 Jenny Duan: So okay, that seems that seems good. Then let's ask him. 291 00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.649 Jenny Duan: the only complicated thing is like he's not directly worked with you, or if he's not like 292 00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.389 Jenny Duan: he's not 293 00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.260 Jenny Duan: He's not directly worked with the or had experience supervising your work. Kelly knows 294 00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.620 Jenny Duan: about you, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but 295 00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.490 Jenny Duan: I do feel like. 296 00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.420 Jenny Duan: I yeah, I just do feel like that is 297 00:34:05",
    ".680 --> 00:34:07.150 Jenny Duan: something concerning 298 00:34:08.103 --> 00:34:11.979 Jenny Duan: would you? Would your history teacher be? Do you think a good 299 00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.319 Jenny Duan: fit for you? Do you think that she would write a but a good one, or do you think she would not. 300 00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:25.820 huda: I think she probably wrote a good one. I mean she's written like 2 for me before 301 00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:45.083 huda: but I'm not sure if, like it was good or not, because she hasn't really like. She has a good perception of me and she's like like we've been together kind of for like 2 years like she's Tommy for ap hug, and now a push. So she's seen me like persevering through her class. But 302 00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.889 huda: Like I don't know. I kind of find a fishy that she won't. I mean, not fishy, but like 303 00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:57.860 huda: like interesting, that she won't like send the Pdf. So like. 304 00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:03.059 huda: yeah. So maybe she's just being like brutally honest. Or she's just like, not comfortable with it. But yeah. 305 00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.296 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's okay. Then let's ask the then let's ask the 306 00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.990 Jenny Duan: the the Linkedin person. 307 00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:14.599 Jenny Duan: Can you make a note to send them a message and then tell them that they don't have to send it to you directly to 308 00:35:15.025 --> 00:35:17.650 Jenny Duan: also email it if they want to. 309 00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.150 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, let's ask them. 310 00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:27.970 Jenny Duan: Okay, then let's look at these questions and 311 00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.080 Jenny Duan: pick one of them. So it's out of these. 312 00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.930 Jenny Duan: How many do you get to choose from? Is it 12 through 17, or which 5. 313 00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.720 huda: It's from 314 00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.384 huda: the unlimited fu",
    "nding part. 315 00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:49.690 huda: wait. 316 00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.240 huda: I think this you have to choose to from. 317 00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.340 huda: 11 318 00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:07.880 huda: for 15. 319 00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.070 Jenny Duan: Okay? 11 to 15. Okay. 320 00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.630 Jenny Duan: okay. 321 00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.109 Jenny Duan: If you were given unlimited support and funding. 322 00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:25.459 Jenny Duan: how would you share an experience you have had? 323 00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.760 Jenny Duan: Have you written a question in response to this before, or something similar. 324 00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:43.560 huda: I think it's kind of similar to the one from Bank of America about like like making education like tutors and stuff more accessible. But yeah, I don't. 325 00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.440 huda: Yeah. 326 00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.210 Jenny Duan: Okay. 327 00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.350 Jenny Duan: this one is a good one to write about. I think this one, you can write something about games. 328 00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.300 Jenny Duan: Think that would be a really good 329 00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.530 Jenny Duan: I say. 330 00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:12.089 huda: I normally feel like this would be like some an essay that I'd want to write about. 331 00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.720 Jenny Duan: You don't feel like it would be. 332 00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.600 huda: Yeah. 333 00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.899 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. That's not an issue. 334 00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:21.260 Jenny Duan: Any other ones that you feel like you would want to write about anything that stands out to you. 335 00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.076 huda: always are really good. 336 00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.913 Jenny Duan: I feel like this one at 12 and 13 are too similar. So I wouldn't write about 12 if you're gonna write about 13, 337 00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.169 Jenny Duan: So 14 or 11 are also kind of so 14 ",
    "or 11. Which one do you think. 338 00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.069 Jenny Duan: Sounds like pretty good. You can write about folklore. Yeah. 339 00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:53.660 huda: Yeah. 340 00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:00.100 huda: yeah, I think also, a lot of people probably choose number 14. This is like the 341 00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.440 huda: like overcoming adversity type of question. 342 00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.260 Jenny Duan: Right? 343 00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.500 Jenny Duan: Okay. Now, let's so, I think these are like some pretty good 344 00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:20.039 Jenny Duan: essay example. These are some pretty good essay examples of like what you might be expected to write during a college application as well, like the type of thinking and the type of writing that you will need to demonstrate. 345 00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.609 Jenny Duan: okay, 1, 2, and 3 are pretty straightforward. 346 00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.690 Jenny Duan: 5. You can just answer pretty straightforward. Lee. 347 00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.289 Jenny Duan: 7. You can also 348 00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.260 Jenny Duan: 7. What do you for? 6. What do you plan to write? 349 00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.020 Jenny Duan: Oops? Yeah. 6. 350 00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:46.639 Jenny Duan: I think this one let's focus on like highlighting your impact in some way. So like, what? How do you see yourself making an impact in the world through your career. 351 00:38:48.822 --> 00:38:50.450 huda: So I think 352 00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.126 huda: I could probably talk about 353 00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.071 huda: like game development. And 354 00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.809 huda: you know. 355 00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:19.940 huda: maybe like I wanted to like, leave a story in into it. I'd probably talk about like how many of like people that I know like my acquaintances like family members. They're like really fidgety, and they they can like learn in some some ways. But then I've taken like 356 00:39:20.345 --> ",
    "00:39:36.144 huda: I've taken like games and other. I feel like I'm kind of reusing my comment at the story. But, I've taken games, and, like other forms of like storytelling, to transform like learning into a fun thing. And 357 00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:42.469 huda: I think maybe like I envision myself growing this in the future. 358 00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:49.839 huda: I feel like it's kind of like, really basic. So I wanna come up with like a better framing that. 359 00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:51.480 Jenny Duan: But way. 360 00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.680 Jenny Duan: yeah. 361 00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.500 Jenny Duan: also, one 362 00:39:55.090 --> 00:40:00.407 Jenny Duan: huge thing. I do really want to highlight really quickly. Before I interrupt too much. 363 00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:11.661 Jenny Duan: okay, this is something.

You can have parent consent. That's fine. 376 00:41:06.733 --> 00:41:07.619 Jenny Duan: And then 377 00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:10.540 Jenny Duan: make a documentation about your 378 00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.210 Jenny Duan: a video walkthrough of your game. 379 00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:14.180 Jenny Duan: Okay? 380 00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:15.429 Jenny Duan: And then. 381 00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.070 Jenny Duan: is your game made in unity or not? 382 00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:19.990 huda: Yep. 383 00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.860 Jenny Duan: Okay, you can. So you can submit to the different. 384 00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.719 Jenny Duan: the different categories. Let me look at the categories they have this year. 385 00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.239 huda: Oh, I think I I think I remember I'm setting like 386 00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.500 huda: starting the submission so like. 387 00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:41.200 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is, I think, that I think you can win this like, I think you have a very high shot of learning this. 388 00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:47.679 Jenny Duan: or like winning, or at least like winning some type of recognition like honor mentioned like a placement or recognition. Something. 389 00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:58.819 Jenny Duan: I think camera impact might be more tough, but I think it's a good exercise for you to go through like writing all those essays. But I do think camera impact is going to be tough for anyone. 390 00:41:59.272 --> 00:42:03.919 Jenny Duan: There's also, in my opinion, like a little bit of nepotism within camera impact 391 00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:13.733 Jenny Duan: that's on a separate note. But I do think that that's that's gonna be harder to win. I t",
    "hink this is very. This should be like a big priority for you, because I think it's like very 392 00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:20.699 Jenny Duan: I don't know feasible. So the categories that I think you could win are made with unity 393 00:42:21.233 --> 00:42:25.470 Jenny Duan: in and game of the year and character design challenge. 394 00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.770 Jenny Duan: I don't think you'd talk about climate change, ocean or 395 00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.449 Jenny Duan: recycling the runway. 396 00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.320 Jenny Duan: but 397 00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.082 Jenny Duan: I do think you have like really good 398 00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:51.358 Jenny Duan: you have a good chance of winning the best game and also the character design challenge, and also the 399 00:42:52.140 --> 00:43:04.399 Jenny Duan: the made with unity. If you want, you can also submit the to the writing competition. The writing is 500 to 7,750 words, and it's a writing a game review 400 00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:10.750 Jenny Duan: of games from their arcade. Let me show you their game. Arcade. Really quickly. 401 00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:17.060 Jenny Duan: this is all detailed on their on their price list. But 402 00:43:17.853 --> 00:43:23.920 Jenny Duan: basically play a game and review it. I think that should be pretty fun. 750 words is not that much? 403 00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.709 Jenny Duan: It's less than a thousand words. 404 00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.919 Jenny Duan: and just like pick one of their games, play it and review it. Yeah. 405 00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:37.809 huda: Amazing. Oh, so with the with the like. The writing composition does that have, like some sort of like recognition or. 406 00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, it's called the impact Game Writing challenge. And you would also win an award. 407 00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.030 huda: Okay. Cool. 408 00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:54.330 Jenny Duan: Okay. But I wanna give this like a big priority because it",
    "'s low. It's low lift for you like, you don't have to do that much just film the tutorial like which you might already have. Do you already have a walkthrough. 409 00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.040 huda: Yeah. 410 00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:01.590 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Maybe like, you can look through it. See if there's anything you want to add to it and then just submit it. Like that's it. Okay? 411 00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:07.019 Jenny Duan: So I think games for change is a really good career choice. So let me write that. 412 00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:30.783 huda: Yeah, also. I think I'm gonna apply again to the women and games Ambassador. So I did. I I did like reach out to the lady who's in charge of the admission and everything. So she said. There's like a new window now. I must have like applied with during a time where the window wasn't open. So like, I guess I'm gonna like, apply again. See if 413 00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.529 huda: like. I get any responses this time. 414 00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems like a really good idea. 415 00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:40.509 Jenny Duan: So games for change is the answer. Number 6, what makes you you? 416 00:44:41.072 --> 00:44:45.650 Jenny Duan: I think this you can be like. It can be like 3 sentences 417 00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:46.740 Jenny Duan: like. 418 00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.880 Jenny Duan: for example, my unwavering commitment to 419 00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:53.919 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 420 00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:06.659 Jenny Duan: like shaping environmental change my passion for late night. Karaoke. 421 00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:07.890 Jenny Duan: my 422 00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:13.769 Jenny Duan: like, you need 3 chain. 3 sentences. Have 2 of them be serious, and one of them be a personality sentence. 423 00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:14.420 huda: Okay. 424 00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.169 Jenny Duan: I think that's gonna be good. 425 00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:17.960 huda: Okay. 426 00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.33",
    "0 Jenny Duan: too serious 427 00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.990 Jenny Duan: one pistol. 428 00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:25.960 Jenny Duan: Okay. 429 00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:34.729 Jenny Duan: I think that this is a probably a good place to pause for today. I think that. Okay? So to recap the biggest priorities right now 430 00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.869 Jenny Duan: submit the foreign service essay competition thing. 431 00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:53.040 Jenny Duan: let's do April first. So you have like this break to work on it. Games for change. Get the game submission in as soon as possible. That should be pretty low lift, since you already have most materials. 432 00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.380 Jenny Duan: Third thing. Get your elementary school toolkit out. 433 00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:15.389 Jenny Duan: After the break. We can talk about this camera impacting we have until May. So we can, we're just gonna continuously work on this. But after the next time we meet I want to like, maybe check in on your foreign service exchange like that. Say competition. And then I also want to check in on the status of 434 00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:22.900 Jenny Duan: we can brainstorm what you're gonna write after you choose a game and play it for the games for change, like writing, competition. 435 00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:34.749 huda: I could. I could probably start writing like a review as well like, maybe if since I don't really have anything to work on right now. I could start writing the review, maybe, and send it over if you have time, like. 436 00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:47.580 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, that sounds perfect. Yeah. And just I mean, it's fun like, play game. Write a review, you know, and the review short, only 7 50 words. So not too much. But biggest thing is, get the foreign service thing in and then work on the toolkit. 437 00:46:47.600 --> 00:47:02.709 Jenny Duan: I think the focus is like, we are really getting to expand your impact a lot as we like level up the award that we're ",
    "applying for over the next year. So we just need to get some concrete numbers in terms of like, how many people you're impacting and like, at what scale. So that's to be really important. 438 00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:03.900 huda: Okay. 439 00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.859 Jenny Duan: Okay.
