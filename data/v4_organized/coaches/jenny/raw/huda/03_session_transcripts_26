Awesome. 4 00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.880 huda: Hi, can you hear me? 5 00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.430 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can hear you. How's it going? 6 00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.990 huda: It's going. Well, how are you? 7 00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.760 Jenny Duan: Good. Yeah. It's nice to see you again. Thanks so much for being flexible. I'm sorry about the last minute change 8 00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.400 huda: no problem. Yeah, it's fine. 9 00:00:40.820 --> 00:01:03.060 Jenny Duan: I was thinking today, I really wanna go and finish up your bank of America essays. If that sounds good, because I know that the deadline for that it's like approaching. So I'd love to just get those finalized and then I'm wondering if you got a chance to look at like I know I've sent you a bunch of stuff over the past few days. So if you have any questions about those I'm happy to answer that if you have anything like just right now. 10 00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:18.299 huda: Yeah. So the nyu thing that you sent I was a bit like unclear, like what? Exactly it was. Was it a scholarship, or like a research? So it's a. 11 00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:35.630 Jenny Duan: It's a research program at Nyu. But there's a scholarship like component of it, because it is a paid program. So I think you should still apply for the research program because I think it's a unique opportunity to like, live in New York to do research on something cool. But then, also you also get to 12 00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:56.900 Jenny Duan: apply for the scholarship to basically have that like fully funded, which I think is a good opportunity. for you. Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. And then II found it because I was looking at the girl Athena. She's like a Stanford freshman this year. That was something that she did. So I just saw that. And I it seemed like it'd be interesting for you. 13 00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.700 huda: Yeah, definitely like, I think I'll look at more into after this class as well. 14 00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.059 Jenny Duan: Yeah, cool. So 15 00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.579 huda: do you want to share a screen? And maybe we can talk through the bank of America essays yeah, let me pull up the essays see. 16 00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.259 huda: okay, see my screen. 17 00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.269 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay. 18 00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.250 Jenny Duan: so 19 00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.160 Jenny Duan: actually, I think, sorry. It might be easier. If I share my screen is is that, okay, okay. 20 00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.620 Jenny Duan: so 21 00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.130 Jenny Duan: can you walk me through what your most recent changes are? 22 00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:06.259 huda: Yeah. So like, I think the most stressful change I made is I wrote the essay about I think it was. What like leadership qualities do you want to gain? 23 00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.279 huda: let me see. Like which number 24 00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.830 huda: on number 7. 25 00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:24.979 huda: Yeah. So I worked on number 7. And so I think we kind of brainstorm this a little bit, and then the one that 26 00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:45.660 huda: and like the quality I thought that I could have improved on it's like my quietness, and like how it's important to be loud and assertive. When you wanna like impact. So I thought of like an example of Barbie. So this is kind of like loosely based off of the movie. But 27 00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.999 huda: so I said, on a Missy e morning I ripped my new barbie away from P, from her packaging to her new home, my doll house. 28 00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:18.060 huda: She was President Barbie, naturally loud, outspoken, and bubbly. So this is kind of like my role model. When I was younger, I guess. I wanna be like her like how they showed her and Barbie life and Dream house, and like other shows. Right? So then, I said, I brought my dolls to school in hopes of sharing it with everyone. To my distress everyone grabbed one and ran off as chaos until the room. 29 00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:43.129 huda: So this is I like created like a situation where I might need my like like loudness in my voice, and like assertiveness to control everything. And, you know, like leave people. And so this is like kind of like the situation. So that I said. I tried to ignore my classmates the same way President Barbie did with her amplified soundbox. But all I manage was week. 30 00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:52.569 huda: naturally quiet, shy, and reserved. So it's kind of like I'd say, like a parallel between like this part and then this part. 31 00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:02.549 huda: So then I go on to say, I've always wanted to be President Barbie, but no matter. The initiative, passion or drive I had for a cause. My own vocal cords held me back. 32 00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:24.699 huda: However, I recently began working on this issue. Through my empowering AI initiative, an AI ethics education, nonprofit. We're collaborating with students across the nation has mainly outspoken. I think this is definitely a part that I was. Gonna if you about cause I don't really go into like how it's made me outspoken, or anything. But this is just kind of like my first draft 33 00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:33.929 huda: and then like, I concluded by kind of wrapping up my goals. So I wanna grow my platform to speak to more people, louder and more assertive of my 34 00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.350 huda: wait 35 00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:49.809 huda: today to start, I want to grow my platform to speak to more people, louder and more assertive of my ideas. I want to continue evolving that squeak into a board. I want to continue my transformation into President Perby. 36 00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.810 Jenny Duan: This looks really good to me. 37 00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:07.900 Jenny Duan: Us are really. I think, Hooda, you're like a very strong writer like after looking at a lot of people's different essays like including, you know, people who are applying to college and younger people. You are like a really good writer. So yourself, because these essays are really fantastic. 38 00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, at this point I I'm looking, and it looks like you're done with all of your essays. Right? Yeah. 39 00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:37.970 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think that what would be good is if we could just start from the top and sort of look through everything and go line by line at like. I know we've done a one over on some of your essays. But I think today I'd really like to finalize everything so that you're ready to submit. Do you have all the other aspects of your application complete, like just the basic demographic information, your latest recommendation. Or is there anything else that you still haven't done yet? 40 00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:45.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I just received my letters of recommendation today. So congratulations. 41 00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.809 Jenny Duan: So empowering AI, I would say. 42 00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:57.580 Jenny Duan: role founder. Maybe you can say nonprofit founder here. I don't think you need to say like technology. Oh, well. 43 00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.270 Jenny Duan: I guess. Hmm. yeah, maybe it. 44 00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.770 Jenny Duan: Let's clarify what this means. Is there a word, count for the like role and time spent? 45 00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.920 huda: Well, let me check. 46 00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.369 huda: I think it's really high, though. 47 00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.240 huda: I think you have like a lot of space. Okay, perfect. So if it's really high, then you can like fill it up. 48 00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.220 huda: I think it's a thousand character. Actually, it's just a thousand. 49 00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.300 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's like a lot. Yeah. 50 00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.589 Jenny Duan: Okay. So empowering. AI, 51 00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.019 Jenny Duan: well, nonprofit founder, okay, what does technology executive? Mean. 52 00:07:45.180 --> 00:08:03.849 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is pretty ambiguous term. Yeah, I think what I meant mainly is because I was in charge of making the website and like developing slides shows which related to technology. So I think, I was more in charge of the technology aspect of it. And I think. 53 00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:12.459 huda: just yeah, like, the website was kind of mainly what I was targeting at. And publicity's for the social media. And like, outreach. 54 00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.459 Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah. 55 00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:31.659 Jenny Duan: so let's I think technology to executive still sounds a little bit ambiguous. So I feel like we can try to find a way to make this more clear for someone who doesn't isn't as familiar with what that would mean. So nonprofit founder. Maybe you could say like. 56 00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.439 Jenny Duan: Hey. can you break down what roles? What were the things you did. I mean, you made the website. What else did you do? 57 00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.950 huda: I developed the website. 58 00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.530 huda: I 59 00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:50.370 huda: I guess I made content for the for, like our actual nonprofit. 60 00:08:50.400 --> 00:09:04.769 huda: I guess that would kind of encompass the role of the founders. So I don't know that's really anything we need to mention. I feel like, honestly, if you say nonprofit founder would be, I think that's good. And what were your key responsibilities as founder 61 00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.379 Jenny Duan: developed website. What else would you do? 62 00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.550 huda: Publicized events. 63 00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:31.870 Jenny Duan: publicize events. What else did you do you? You developed curriculum, right? They did. Education, curriculum, developed website, publicized events. Maybe like people management, you let a team, or I mean, you only had one person. But like you let you say about that like. 64 00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.889 huda: I'd say, yeah, like team management and 65 00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.480 Jenny Duan: team management. 66 00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:50.570 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, maybe like organized teams time spent. And what's the time spent? 67 00:09:51.660 --> 00:10:06.630 huda: I don't really. I didn't really know. Like how to like, give a specific time, ask for like a number of ta hours per week? Or is it just like total like, how do they structure that? I think it's like, 68 00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.670 huda: this many hours per week per year? 69 00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.130 Jenny Duan: Okay. 70 00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:21.000 huda: so I think me and my friend or like the Vice President, we've been starting to actually like meet up every week. So I would say, like 71 00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.489 But like 1 h per week doesn't really sound strong. So 72 00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:32.460 Jenny Duan: you spend a lot of time like making the website and everything else right like time, so maybe 5 h per week. 73 00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.649 huda: let's say, like 50 weeks a year. That's fine. 74 00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:45.599 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is the right format. What what format did they ask for the time spent in again. Let me put like an example. 75 00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.070 Jenny Duan: Hello. 76 00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.829 huda: made it something like this. 77 00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:08.350 huda: I think we might need to like, explain it on like another response. 78 00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.119 Jenny Duan: Oh, Gotcha, I mean focusing on one of these 2, 2 or. 79 00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.339 huda: okay, yeah. 80 00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:23.390 Jenny Duan: okay, I think then, we don't need this nonprofit founder. And then how many, how much time. Total, have you spent 81 00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.650 huda: like a hundred hours, 200 h, 300 h. 82 00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:42.780 Jenny Duan: 50 h week, maybe like, 100 h. yeah, okay. 83 00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:53.139 Jenny Duan: okay, full click. Okay. So following this, I would say, just, I would say, nonprofit founder again, is this it 84 00:11:53.590 --> 00:12:02.810 huda: and then time, spent how much? I spent more time on this. So I'd say, like, maybe like, 8 HA week. 85 00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.720 Jenny Duan: okay, and how much total time? 86 00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.889 huda: We could put. This is like, maybe like 87 00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.119 huda: 1 80. 88 00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.439 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then teachers, assistant sports volunteer. This is good. 89 00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.220 Jenny Duan: 2 h. 90 00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.970 Jenny Duan: See? 91 00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.440 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then 92 00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.990 Jenny Duan: let's see. 93 00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.669 Jenny Duan: there's also your game, Cynthoria. 94 00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.739 huda: Yeah, I don't know if that would count as like immunity. Oh, I see what you mean. 95 00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:54.310 Jenny Duan: What others can. Community and volunteer. I wonder if you're film club? Do you think that counts? 96 00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.370 huda: I think accounts is like a leadership activity? 97 00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:05.940 Jenny Duan: Do you volunteer in any other community organizations, or have you ever in the past like a one day, events, or anything like that? 98 00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:14.699 huda: I've I think I'm volunteered for like a science. 99 00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:22.849 huda: the the size fair. I think that those are 6 h not 6 h, 4 h total 100 00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:31.090 huda: and I was like managing like the students, like setups and everything. I don't know if that counts too much. 101 00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.760 huda: And then 102 00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:45.759 Jenny Duan: maybe I can go to like my services and see what I put. Yeah. Okay. Cool assigns. Signs. Fair. What? What is the name of the signs? Fair? 103 00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.020 huda: It was called Altamont Science Fair. 104 00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.600 Jenny Duan: Can you write that in? I don't know. I spelled that. 105 00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.380 Jenny Duan: And you've only done this 4 h right? Total. 106 00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.720 huda: Yeah. 107 00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:05.940 Nope. 108 00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:50.540 Jenny Duan: looking at your service list. Is there anything else that you want to add. or that you can really slow. But I'll let you know. 109 00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.389 huda: And okay. 110 00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:16.160 huda: courts for humanity, like I think I I made a few, I mean, like a bunch of cards. So I got like 5 h for that. 111 00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.309 But that's like 112 00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.909 not an actual volunteer like 113 00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:33.159 Jenny Duan: is that is that attached to another organization that could count. Is it? Was it attached to another organization? Yeah, I think so. What was the organization name? 114 00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.780 huda: I think it's cords 115 00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.520 isn't cursed for a minute. Let me check the name. 116 00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.160 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you? Wanna so were you able to find, like the number of hours you spent on that program. 117 00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.649 It's still look like I think 118 00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.359 Jenny Duan: it's still loading. But 119 00:16:52.870 --> 00:17:01.340 huda: we find the name. But yeah, so I think, let me think of other things that I might have done. Well. 120 00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:11.079 huda: there was like a disease awareness club and I participated in. I think it was also like another like 121 00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:17.250 huda: card like volunteer hour. Where we like remote like hospitals. 122 00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.570 huda: I mean, see, there is more. 123 00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.940 It was the do good feel good. Quote. 124 00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.359 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, can you write that into the document, too? 125 00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.810 huda: Yeah. 126 00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:40.529 Jenny Duan: Awesome. And then what type of volunteer were you like? Could you be specific like, what type of volunteer lead, volunteer, or anything like that. 127 00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.820 Well. 128 00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.389 huda: I think. 129 00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.440 huda: I think I 130 00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.029 huda: well, it's kind of just like a voluntary event, so like 131 00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:01.580 huda: like 132 00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.239 huda: I don't exactly know like how to name it. So maybe I could be like 133 00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:16.000 huda: a creative answer, since, like I created like cards and 134 00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:24.370 huda: like, I think it was like this. A specific amount was like we have to create cards for like the janitors, over Christmas break. So 135 00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:30.889 huda: like, I mean, like a whole lot. So I think maybe the creative volunteer, if that sounds good. 136 00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.560 Jenny Duan: that sounds good. 137 00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.959 huda: let's see like any. 138 00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.929 huda: But this is only for 41 139 00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.190 huda: characters. 140 00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:12.470 huda: I feel like we should be able to put club cause 141 00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.580 huda: that's what I put for 142 00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.799 huda: like along the service powers. 143 00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:29.759 Jenny Duan: but I think it's fine if you're like in school leadership, if it's if it's here, I think that's fine, though. because I wouldn't try to double count things. Does that make sense? 144 00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:42.340 huda: Okay, there's also, like, another role I play in like the Muslim Mountain House Muslim Association. Like we had a 145 00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:50.819 huda: like a fundraising event, and I was in charge of like like giving out the food and 146 00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.309 huda: and like taking care of the children in the area. 147 00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.230 huda: Real quick. I was able to log it. But yes. 148 00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.860 Jenny Duan: Is that. Would that count as a school activity, or as a like volunteer thing. 149 00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:11.440 huda: I think it's more of a volunteer thing. It was outside of school. So 150 00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:17.409 huda: about the organization is like, just in our town. So yeah. 151 00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.250 Jenny Duan: you want to write that one in. That sounds like a good fit, too. Okay. 152 00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.270 huda: yeah. 153 00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:59.169 huda: I don't know. Like, what's the word for like taking care of kids cause 154 00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:12.639 huda: babies. Or what do you mean taking care of kids? Yeah, like, I'm like providing like activities and like, educational content. Oh, like 155 00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.820 Jenny Duan: Adrian and child care volunteer. 156 00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.499 huda: Okay, that sounds good. 157 00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.620 Jenny Duan: I'm spend. 158 00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.179 Jenny Duan: And how many activities do they allow you to put in? By the way. 159 00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:34.079 huda: It doesn't say. But like, yeah, at the time 160 00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:41.419 huda: at that, the character Max is 1,000. So it says like over the past 2 years. And 161 00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:49.579 huda: so, yeah, I think that's like, good for the past 2 years. 162 00:21:51.190 --> 00:22:00.010 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, how much time did you spend on this? I think this is a good amount of activities. I wouldn't, I think, add more to this unless you have anything else that you can think of. That's big. 163 00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:04.129 huda: I don't. I can't really think of anything like substantial 164 00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.040 huda: but 165 00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.310 huda: yeah. 166 00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.509 Jenny Duan: cool sounds good. 167 00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.690 Jenny Duan: so focusing on 2 organizations. Which ones do you want to talk about. 168 00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.849 huda: Maybe that sounds good. 169 00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.900 Jenny Duan: yeah. So 170 00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.470 Jenny Duan: these, I think, are just. Did they give you an example? Format for how you're supposed to write this? 171 00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:39.250 huda: no, but they do. They do have like a 1,000 character maximum. And then also, like the bullet point. 172 00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.750 Jenny Duan: okay, maybe. 173 00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:54.339 Jenny Duan: You can say like at full flift or like. 174 00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.030 Jenny Duan: I 175 00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:25.390 Jenny Duan: maybe I'm writing a sentence about why you decide to like found these organizations and how it impacts the community. And what inspired you to participate. I would say, try to aim for the most quantifiable impact possible. So for empowering AI would talk about the curriculum that you've planned the partnership that you have with, like your co-founder, maybe, and then maybe, like the potential guests that you've been able to bring. And then for folklift I would focus on like the people that you're interviewing and the impact that you will might have on their businesses. 176 00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.560 huda: And so 177 00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:38.920 Jenny Duan: yeah, do you think that you'd be able to write a short blurb right now? Or do you want some more time to think about that? And then, just like we can meet another time really quickly to go over it, or you can send it to me, and I can edit that later. What do you think? 178 00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:46.470 huda: I think I'll get like like a real quick, like rough version of it, and then we can. You can maybe send me edits like later. 179 00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.880 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Yep. hmm! 180 00:23:52.790 --> 00:24:01.469 huda: I think, should put this in bullet point like format. Or do you think I should just like write it? I think I just read a paragraph. It's fine. Okay. 181 00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.609 Jenny Duan: on that roll back. 182 00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.020 huda: I guess. 183 00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.030 Hmm! 184 00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.000 huda: Can you assist me? 185 00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.140 huda: I guess 186 00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.450 Jenny Duan: this looks really good.

So I think like the only thing that I think it sounds pretty good, but if I had to change something maybe like 234 00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:40.990 huda: learn from the curiosity and passion of those we affect? Maybe, like, from the young minds. 235 00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.290 Jenny Duan: huh? 236 00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.180 Jenny Duan: Of the young minds. 237 00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.620 Jenny Duan: What about like those we in inspire?

Usually we'll have like people have like grocery stores and like large corporations around them. But since we're relatively like new as a as this city. 248 00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:07.129 huda: We don't have any of those resources. And then instead to cope like our our community kind of built itself 249 00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:16.189 Jenny Duan: perfect because you wanna leverage your background like saying that you don't have these resources. And that's why you need to like this type of platform. Okay, 250 00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:20.129 Jenny Duan: okay, let's see in my town. 251 00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.940 Jenny Duan: in my town. We don't 252 00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.720 Jenny Duan: have 253 00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.140 Jenny Duan: large corporate stores. brother 254 00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.140 Jenny Duan: brother community members 255 00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.839 Jenny Duan: support each other's businesses. 256 00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:51.029 Jenny Duan: Well, that would be. And Mr. Inspired by 257 00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:57.170 Jenny Duan: this. These exchanges. 258 00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:06.169 Jenny Duan: I oh, II see what you mean by the were you trying to make a parallel structure with the not so common versus common. 259 00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.870 Jenny Duan: I'm here. all right. 260 00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.709 huda: I know. Yeah. 261 00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.650 Jenny Duan: Inspired by these changes, I created E 262 00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:30.910 Jenny Duan: an opportunity to amplify Muslim businesses which are underrepresented 263 00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:36.050 Jenny Duan: in common shopping decisions. 264 00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.830 Jenny Duan: combining my creative skills 265 00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.199 Jenny Duan: in film making. 266 00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:58.569 Jenny Duan: In journalism. I developed a website. garnered volunteers from across the world 267 00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:04.020 Jenny Duan: and increased business traffic through 268 00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:15.550 Jenny Duan: by amplifying individual stories. 269 00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.430 Jenny Duan: This might be too long. 270 00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.750 Jenny Duan: I think this is gonna be too long. But we can check 271 00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.150 Jenny Duan: 27 characters. Okay, that's 272 00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.040 huda: yeah. 273 00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:45.950 Jenny Duan: Okay. 11 characters. 274 00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:53.190 Jenny Duan: Maybe instead of prospering in sync row. yeah. 275 00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.510 huda: from 276 00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.100 huda: different. 277 00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.660 huda: I think that's longer. She. 278 00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.930 Jenny Duan: I created a 279 00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:21.930 Jenny Duan: space 280 00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.000 Jenny Duan: I created. 281 00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.340 Jenny Duan: I 282 00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.930 Jenny Duan: go to. 283 00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.450 Jenny Duan: This is good. 284 00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Well, can you give us a once over and tell me how this feels to you? 285 00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.110 Okay, 286 00:39:54.170 --> 00:40:09.109 huda: oh, both of them. Okay. So I found an empowering AI with the mission to platform girls from sixth to twelfth grade with a network to learn collaborate and access. Some male dominated technology curriculum. 287 00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:20.869 huda: seems like we could change this. It's kind of confusing where it says, email, dominant technology curriculum. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And access a 288 00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.980 Jenny Duan: space. 289 00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.029 Jenny Duan: Or how do we? Yeah. 290 00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:32.150 huda: I think we should, since I talk about the curriculum like after maybe good and access 291 00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.290 huda: a male dominated field. That is technology 292 00:40:40.470 --> 00:41:00.580 huda: like this. With my co-founder we created a full AI and ais curriculum, connecting with young aspiring minds, while also incubating their passions by inspiring others. I not only hope to learn with the curiosity and passion of those we inspire, but also ultimately shape the future of women in technology. 293 00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:14.870 huda: Okay, that sounds good. I think, covers all the points as well. Okay. And then folklift. I also found folklift a platform for small minority, own businesses to grow their from creative media 294 00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:40.270 huda: in my town. We don't have large corporate stores, rather community members support each other's businesses. Inspired by these exchanges, I started to amplify Muslim businesses which are underrepresented and common shopping decisions. Combining my creative skills in filmmaking and journalism, I developed a website, garnered volunteers from across the world and increased business traffic by amplifying individual stories. 295 00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:46.650 huda: That's really good. I think I think definitely like the last sentence, it like shows like the impact. Most. 296 00:41:47.220 --> 00:42:03.160 Jenny Duan: Oh, awesome. Okay, so this looks good. We this looks good to me for the school. I would say. mom has to be cause people don't know what mh, TV is so. 297 00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:15.489 Jenny Duan: News, chief editor, anchoring Carol.

But let me give this a read over 299 00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.990 Jenny Duan: and even paging 300 00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.300 Jenny Duan: natural. 301 00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:43.910 Jenny Duan: Hey, Rose, I brought my Dolce's school. They don't think we need a comma here in hopes of sharing them with everyone. To my distress everyone grab one, and ran off as chaos entailed in the room. 302 00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.179 Jenny Duan: I love this parallel structure. 303 00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.819 huda: Thank you. I'm really impressive. 304 00:42:50.930 --> 00:43:00.600 Jenny Duan: I've always wanted to be President Barbie, but no matter. The initial passenger drive I had for a cause. My vocal cords, coming down my own vocal cords held me back, however. 305 00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:06.390 Jenny Duan: through 306 00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:11.300 Jenny Duan: through my empowering AI initiative and AI ethics educational nonprofit 307 00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:17.460 Jenny Duan: where 308 00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:26.660 Jenny Duan: I now collaborate the students across the nation. 309 00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:36.200 Jenny Duan: Maybe like I have become more outspoken. I have found my voice. 310 00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:39.030 huda: You think that 311 00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.040 Jenny Duan: II want to confront. 312 00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:52.710 Jenny Duan: I want to. I feel like I and becoming President Barbie Company. 313 00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.590 Jenny Duan: pause. This. 314 00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.960 Jenny Duan: I think I am becoming, is a little bit more powerful than I want to become. 315 00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.140 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, I think the rest is good. 316 00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:10.930 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what do you think about the rest of the essay? It feels good to me. But yeah, I think I think so. 317 00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:17.119 huda: Yeah, I think we did clarify a bit more on before. 318 00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.200 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. 319 00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:29.179 Jenny Duan: of course, if you in a way, I feel like I still have to do it. I never thought someone like me could do it. 320 00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:41.489 Jenny Duan: Well, yeah. Also, I think for the last essay, number 9. I edited the last 321 00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:49.379 huda: last 2 paragraphs, and I changed it from like the one where I showed my growth. And I couldn't change it to 322 00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.460 huda: kind of like a deeper analysis. So I said. 323 00:44:52.530 --> 00:45:16.499 huda: so said many adolescents have the mindset that if it doesn't affect them. It isn't worth pursuing, and that's exactly the issue. Or that's exactly the issue. Ignorance and apathy play. Today's youth and superficial engagement masks a deeper lack of empathy. And yeah, I use this chat. Pt, sentence, 324 00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:31.849 Jenny Duan: so like, use chat. TV, okay, here's the thing, hooda. Some people don't use chat, Gp, and their writing still sounds like chat. Gp, you can use chatty vg, and as long as sounds like you're writing, it doesn't matter. So 325 00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:40.229 huda: okay, a deeper lack of empathy and understanding for critical social issues that affect other people than other people 326 00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.150 huda: dance and sobs. 327 00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:57.970 huda: So it is time time to burst the Perley level, that the adolescence of this generation sit in time to advocate for issues larger than ourselves, because it's not just about ourselves. It's about our future. 328 00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.130 huda: It was really good 329 00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.890 Jenny Duan: about our collective future. 330 00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.080 Jenny Duan: Okay? 331 00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.989 Jenny Duan: Instead of ignoring its presenting. 332 00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.460 Yeah. 333 00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.830 Jenny Duan: what does this bell jar have to do with the rest of the essay. 334 00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.279 huda: It's kind of just like a like a example of like things that like 335 00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.350 huda: it's how 336 00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:47.370 huda: like kids these days, kids these days. But like people young people these days. They don't really like understand things for their like meaning like, which is like more important because the the bell jar is like about like 337 00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:51.339 huda: mental health for females. And it's just like 338 00:46:51.580 --> 00:47:01.629 huda: people don't like reading that book because it's like too serious, and it doesn't affect them. So that's kind of what I went at there. But maybe we could change that. 339 00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.500 Jenny Duan: Did you read this book in class? Or where did you first like? Engage with it? 340 00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:11.509 huda: I read out my own. But like, I think a lot of schools do read it in class. 341 00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:17.840 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can 342 00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.250 Jenny Duan: hold open 343 00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.219 Jenny Duan: conversation about 344 00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.709 Jenny Duan: books like the bell jar. 345 00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.370 Jenny Duan: instead of ignoring its representation. 346 00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:39.690 Jenny Duan: I, instead of ignoring representations of female mental health and well being in the media 347 00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:42.380 Jenny Duan: in in media? 348 00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.620 Jenny Duan: Okay. 349 00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:52.289 Jenny Duan: hmm, I guess. Does that make more sense? Does this? Does the sentence make sense, or does is this not cohesive. 350 00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.890 Jenny Duan: yeah. 351 00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:11.500 huda: I think we could remove it. Overall, because I feel like like you said it doesn't like it. The specific example might confuse people cause like they might think that I'm talking about how people don't care about female mental health. Maybe we could remove that. 352 00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:19.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think we should add another sentence instead. 4 days one. 353 00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.060 huda: What's another example? 354 00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.479 huda: maybe like 355 00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:39.770 huda: My peers will change their profile pictures and think it's like, I mean, like 356 00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:48.870 huda: I'm kind of talk about like I think there's a good channel like Blackout Tuesday, where just change your profile pictures. So maybe like 357 00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:53.379 huda: our 50 days were 358 00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.130 huda: I mean, it's kind of similar. So in in for infographing so like. 359 00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.450 huda: maybe not that find. 360 00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.969 huda: I think it's fine. I feel like 361 00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:12.429 Jenny Duan: I pay for days for my peers. Read the impressive questions that are performative activism. 362 00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.830 Jenny Duan: They. 363 00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:22.530 Jenny Duan: instead of performative activism hidden behind a social media facade. 364 00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:30.459 Jenny Duan: I courage to care for issues, issues, issues, issues, issues. 365 00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:40.270 Jenny Duan: concerning life, instead of being confused. consumed by their own superciliousness. 366 00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:47.300 Jenny Duan: Present, happened to sit at Mike in terms of bantering. 367 00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.930 Jenny Duan: One day I heard I heard 368 00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:07.109 Jenny Duan: one day, while he and his friends were entering. I heard the arser from a shop they're showing us. Bossy wasn't surprised. 369 00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:08.989 Jenny Duan: but he obviously cares about. 370 00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:19.129 Jenny Duan: but issue with them is that they become so self involved with their jokes and trivial matters that they fail to look outside them 371 00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:29.000 Jenny Duan: sort of mature, but what ages it recognizes ignorance. Large maturity is ex is exposure to different is exp is exposure to 372 00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:35.150 Jenny Duan: those 373 00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:38.639 Jenny Duan: different from ourselves. 374 00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.319 Jenny Duan: Cynthia always often sets her empathy, and when younger people cannot express the same issues. 375 00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:53.080 Jenny Duan: And then they don't advocate for them many adolescents 376 00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.410 Jenny Duan: here 377 00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.380 Jenny Duan: urge to change 378 00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:11.859 Jenny Duan: often stems from everything, and when you hear people around the world they don't advocate for them. But if something 379 00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.110 Jenny Duan: doesn't affect them. 380 00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.920 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this looks good to me. Can you give us a once over and let me know what you think? 381 00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:47.010 huda: Okay, I pray for days where my peers read the infographics they post and start performative activism hidden behind a social media facade. I pray for days when young people develop empathy and care for issues concerning life, instead of being consumed by their own superciliousness. In my school there is a club devoted to spreading awareness of disabilities. The President happened to sit at my computer science table 382 00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:59.540 huda: one day, he, he! While he and his friends were bantering, I heard the Arsler de derogatory term towards the disabled community which he isn't part of from his mouth. Maybe I can remove this from his. 383 00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.299 Jenny Duan: I think you can find anything. You can keep it. It's okay. 384 00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.429 Maybe you can say I heard him. I heard him 385 00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.700 Jenny Duan: save the arser. How's that? 386 00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.820 huda: Yeah. 387 00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:17.429 huda: I feel like, but this part I don't know from his mouth. 388 00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:34.710 huda: Sounds kind of weird. You can delete that like. Instead of writing from his math, you can just say I heard him say, Yes, okay, it was shocking to see someone who displayed such a nuanced and shareitable front disrespecting the community he wants advocated for. But honestly, I wasn't surprised. 389 00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:50.689 huda: was a lighthearted joke. Yes, he's just a boy. Yes, he obviously still cares about issues larger than himself. Yes, the issue with young people today is that they become so self involved with themselves, with their jokes and trivial matters, that they look fail to look outside of them. 390 00:52:50.740 --> 00:53:03.639 huda: The word word immature is often associated with younger ages, but at what age is it recognizes ignorance. A large part of maturity is exposure to diff to those different from ourselves, the courage to change 391 00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:07.740 huda: the courage for change. Baby. 392 00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:09.030 Jenny Duan: yeah. 393 00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:21.650 huda: For change often stems from empathy, and when younger people cannot experience the same issues as those around the world they don't advocate for them. Many added license have 394 00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:42.920 huda: the mind said that if something doesn't affect them it isn't worth pursuing. That's the exact issue. Ignorance and apathy play. Today's youth and superficial engagement makes a deeper lack masks, a deeper lack of empathy and understanding for critical social issues that affect people other than themselves. So it is time to reverse the pearly bubble that that 395 00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:57.169 huda: the adolescence of this generation sit in to advocate for issues larger than ourselves, because it's not just about ourselves. It's about our collective future. 396 00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:02.369 huda: It's all great. That's really good, really powerful essay. 397 00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:14.369 huda: Thank you. Do you think I'm like doing too much like parallelism and like repetition. So I feel like I do that a lot. It's a sign of like good and mature writing. 398 00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.660 huda: Thank you. 399 00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:27.730 Jenny Duan: Why do you want to be a bank of America student leader? And why should you be chosen? Of course, if you feed my kids and everything, but in a way I feel like I still got to do what I'm passionate about at at this point 400 00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:36.010 Jenny Duan: her folklift and it shows her to highlight, small Muslim own businesses in my community, their passion for journalism I saw I 401 00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.839 Jenny Duan: so an opportunity to shape change to storytelling. 402 00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:50.210 Jenny Duan: Right then it struck me that people care. People care about what they see in the world, and who, far as a new generation of leaders, divers leadership, and by the exchange of new ideas in area. This is so good 403 00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.110 and fixing affairs in the 404 00:54:54.320 --> 00:55:10.549 Jenny Duan: gender equality and cultural inclusion. 405 00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:23.590 Jenny Duan: This is perfect. I think I also read over this before. This is very good. Okay, I think at this point you are ready to submit. oh, sorry. This like keeps turning on 406 00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.640 Jenny Duan: yeah. 407 00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:49.050 Jenny Duan: do you? Wanna maybe I think at this point I'm I'm approving your essays. Sorry. I know it's loud outside. I'm approving your essays to submit. So I would say, once you have a chance, I would get one more. Read over everything. And then, once you feel like you're ready, I would say you can submit everything, and I would do so earlier rather than later. Just in case there are any technical issues with the actual submission process. 408 00:55:49.250 --> 00:56:02.569 huda: Yeah, I think I'll I'll have like my sister read over it and ask for like what she thinks. And then, yeah, I'll I'll be able to submit it. I think I might. I I'll do like maybe tomorrow, day after tomorrow. 409 00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:24.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds really good. And then after this, I think for us, just like a look ahead. It's gonna be probably like application writing for the next couple of weeks. So they know that there is other stuff coming up that I think we can focus on so I think the next upcoming deadline is Notre Dame. Is that correct? Or is there one before that? 410 00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.609 huda: I think it's Notre Dame. Yeah. 411 00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:34.139 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think so. I think Notre Dame should be the focus next. And then, whenever you get the chance, I would try to 412 00:56:34.260 --> 00:57:01.539 Jenny Duan: the grip. Tape application should be really quick. What that is is. It's $500 to like, basically do whatever you want and learn anything that you want. I think it could be good. If you want to buy some like film equipment. If you want to buy some music production like software or something like that. I did it. And I used the money to buy like a camera, a blogging camera. And I used it to make like 2 Youtube videos. So I think it's a good experience. It's really easy to apply. You just submit a video like a short video. 413 00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:14.180 Jenny Duan: If I remember quickly, so I would try to look at that. The hackathon I would definitely apply for the one in Boston. It's coming up. I think. I sent you a link for that that should be free, they should be able. You should be able to get a reimbursement for them to fly you out to go. 414 00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.620 Jenny Duan: I think. Have you ever traveled by yourself before? No. 415 00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:42.750 Jenny Duan: I think you should take this opportunity and go hack Club is this is not a scam organization. This is like a real organization hat club. I think I've talked to you, maybe briefly about it before my sister did Hack Club. I think my sister might. I'll tell her to go to this conference or this Hackathon. But if you go to the hackathon, it's a good experience, because you can win prizes, you can connect with other students. And it's just fun, because they usually will like cover your travel so you can go there and like code for a weekend 416 00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:57.070 Jenny Duan: and that should be really fun. Hack Club has like a really supportive female community, too. So you should be able to meet a lot of like young women programmers, too. So that's what that is. And then the Nyu program is like for the future. But that's something to keep in mind as well, too. 417 00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:58.730 huda: Okay. 418 00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:19.839 huda: yeah. I think that sounds great. I did like I started or like form my college list already, like the ranking so far. On the document. So yes, and I'm what I've been working on. But like other than that, do you have like any things for me to specifically work on till the next time we meet. 419 00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:43.049 Jenny Duan: I don't think so. I think just I'll take a look at your college list, and I'll be prepared with some feedback for next time. Alright, yeah, thanks so much. Have a good evening. I know we've been a little extra time. So thanks for staying on. But I think ready. Just let me know when you submit them. And yeah, I'll see you on Saturday. Alright, thank you. Bye, bye.",

Awesome. 4 00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.880 huda: Hi, can you hear me? 5 00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.430 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can hear you. How's it going? 6 00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.990 huda: It's going. Well, how are you? 7 00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.760 Jenny Duan: Good. Yeah. It's nice to see you again. Thanks so much for being flexible.

Yeah, it's fine. 9 00:00:40.820 --> 00:01:03.060 Jenny Duan: I was thinking today, I really wanna go and finish up your bank of America essays. If that sounds good, because I know that the deadline for that it's like approaching. So I'd love to just get those finalized and then I'm wondering if you got a chance to look at like I know I've sent you a bunch of stuff over the past few days. So if you have any questions about those I'm happy to answer that if you have anything like just right now. 10 00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:18.299 huda: Yeah. So the nyu thing that you sent I was a bit like unclear, like what? Exactly it was. Was it a scholarship, or like a research? So it's a. 11 00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:35.630 Jenny Duan: It's a research program at Nyu. But there's a scholarship like component of it, because it is a paid program. So I think you should still apply for the research program because I think it's a unique opportunity to like, live in New York to do research on something cool. But then, also you also get to 12 00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:56.900 Jenny Duan: apply for the scholarship to basically have that like fully funded, which I think is a good opportunity. for you. Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. And then II found it because I was looking at the girl Athena. She's lik",
    "e a Stanford freshman this year. That was something that she did. So I just saw that. And I it seemed like it'd be interesting for you. 13 00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.700 huda: Yeah, definitely like, I think I'll look at more into after this class as well. 14 00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.059 Jenny Duan: Yeah, cool. So 15 00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.579 huda: do you want to share a screen? And maybe we can talk through the bank of America essays yeah, let me pull up the essays see. 16 00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.259 huda: okay, see my screen. 17 00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.269 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay. 18 00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.250 Jenny Duan: so 19 00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.160 Jenny Duan: actually, I think, sorry. It might be easier. If I share my screen is is that, okay, okay. 20 00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.620 Jenny Duan: so 21 00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.130 Jenny Duan: can you walk me through what your most recent changes are? 22 00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:06.259 huda: Yeah. So like, I think the most stressful change I made is I wrote the essay about I think it was. What like leadership qualities do you want to gain? 23 00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.279 huda: let me see. Like which number 24 00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.830 huda: on number 7. 25 00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:24.979 huda: Yeah. So I worked on number 7. And so I think we kind of brainstorm this a little bit, and then the one that 26 00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:45.660 huda: and like the quality I thought that I could have improved on it's like my quietness, and like how it's important to be loud and assertive. When you wanna like impact. So I thought of like an example of Barbie. So this is kind of like loosely based off of the movie. But 27 00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.999 huda: so I said, on a Missy e morning I ripped my new barbie away from P, from her packaging to her new home, my doll house. 28 00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:18.060 huda: She was President Barbie, naturally loud, outspoken, and bubbly. So this is kind of like my role model.",
    " When I was younger, I guess. I wanna be like her like how they showed her and Barbie life and Dream house, and like other shows. Right? So then, I said, I brought my dolls to school in hopes of sharing it with everyone. To my distress everyone grabbed one and ran off as chaos until the room. 29 00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:43.129 huda: So this is I like created like a situation where I might need my like like loudness in my voice, and like assertiveness to control everything. And, you know, like leave people. And so this is like kind of like the situation. So that I said. I tried to ignore my classmates the same way President Barbie did with her amplified soundbox. But all I manage was week. 30 00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:52.569 huda: naturally quiet, shy, and reserved. So it's kind of like I'd say, like a parallel between like this part and then this part. 31 00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:02.549 huda: So then I go on to say, I've always wanted to be President Barbie, but no matter. The initiative, passion or drive I had for a cause. My own vocal cords held me back. 32 00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:24.699 huda: However, I recently began working on this issue. Through my empowering AI initiative, an AI ethics education, nonprofit. We're collaborating with students across the nation has mainly outspoken. I think this is definitely a part that I was. Gonna if you about cause I don't really go into like how it's made me outspoken, or anything. But this is just kind of like my first draft 33 00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:33.929 huda: and then like, I concluded by kind of wrapping up my goals. So I wanna grow my platform to speak to more people, louder and more assertive of my 34 00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.350 huda: wait 35 00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:49.809 huda: today to start, I want to grow my platform to speak to more people, louder and more assertive of my ideas. I want to continue evolving that squeak into a board. I want to continue my transformation into President Perby. 36 00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52",
    ".810 Jenny Duan: This looks really good to me. 37 00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:07.900 Jenny Duan: Us are really. I think, Hooda, you're like a very strong writer like after looking at a lot of people's different essays like including, you know, people who are applying to college and younger people. You are like a really good writer. So yourself, because these essays are really fantastic. 38 00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, at this point I I'm looking, and it looks like you're done with all of your essays. Right? Yeah. 39 00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:37.970 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think that what would be good is if we could just start from the top and sort of look through everything and go line by line at like. I know we've done a one over on some of your essays. But I think today I'd really like to finalize everything so that you're ready to submit. Do you have all the other aspects of your application complete, like just the basic demographic information, your latest recommendation. Or is there anything else that you still haven't done yet? 40 00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:45.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I just received my letters of recommendation today. So congratulations. 41 00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.809 Jenny Duan: So empowering AI, I would say. 42 00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:57.580 Jenny Duan: role founder. Maybe you can say nonprofit founder here. I don't think you need to say like technology. Oh, well. 43 00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.270 Jenny Duan: I guess. Hmm. yeah, maybe it. 44 00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.770 Jenny Duan: Let's clarify what this means. Is there a word, count for the like role and time spent? 45 00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.920 huda: Well, let me check. 46 00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.369 huda: I think it's really high, though. 47 00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.240 huda: I think you have like a lot of space. Okay, perfect. So if it's really high, then you can like fill it up. 48 00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.220 huda: I think it's a thousand character. Actually, it's just a ",
    "thousand. 49 00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.300 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's like a lot. Yeah. 50 00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.589 Jenny Duan: Okay. So empowering. AI, 51 00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.019 Jenny Duan: well, nonprofit founder, okay, what does technology executive? Mean. 52 00:07:45.180 --> 00:08:03.849 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is pretty ambiguous term. Yeah, I think what I meant mainly is because I was in charge of making the website and like developing slides shows which related to technology. So I think, I was more in charge of the technology aspect of it. And I think. 53 00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:12.459 huda: just yeah, like, the website was kind of mainly what I was targeting at. And publicity's for the social media. And like, outreach. 54 00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.459 Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah. 55 00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:31.659 Jenny Duan: so let's I think technology to executive still sounds a little bit ambiguous. So I feel like we can try to find a way to make this more clear for someone who doesn't isn't as familiar with what that would mean. So nonprofit founder. Maybe you could say like. 56 00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.439 Jenny Duan: Hey. can you break down what roles? What were the things you did. I mean, you made the website. What else did you do? 57 00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.950 huda: I developed the website. 58 00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.530 huda: I 59 00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:50.370 huda: I guess I made content for the for, like our actual nonprofit. 60 00:08:50.400 --> 00:09:04.769 huda: I guess that would kind of encompass the role of the founders. So I don't know that's really anything we need to mention. I feel like, honestly, if you say nonprofit founder would be, I think that's good. And what were your key responsibilities as founder 61 00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.379 Jenny Duan: developed website. What else would you do? 62 00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.550 huda: Publicized events. 63 00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:31.870 Jenny Duan: publicize events. What else did y",
    "ou do you? You developed curriculum, right? They did. Education, curriculum, developed website, publicized events. Maybe like people management, you let a team, or I mean, you only had one person. But like you let you say about that like. 64 00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.889 huda: I'd say, yeah, like team management and 65 00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.480 Jenny Duan: team management. 66 00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:50.570 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, maybe like organized teams time spent. And what's the time spent? 67 00:09:51.660 --> 00:10:06.630 huda: I don't really. I didn't really know. Like how to like, give a specific time, ask for like a number of ta hours per week? Or is it just like total like, how do they structure that? I think it's like, 68 00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.670 huda: this many hours per week per year? 69 00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.130 Jenny Duan: Okay. 70 00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:21.000 huda: so I think me and my friend or like the Vice President, we've been starting to actually like meet up every week. So I would say, like 71 00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.489 But like 1 h per week doesn't really sound strong. So 72 00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:32.460 Jenny Duan: you spend a lot of time like making the website and everything else right like time, so maybe 5 h per week. 73 00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.649 huda: let's say, like 50 weeks a year. That's fine. 74 00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:45.599 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is the right format. What what format did they ask for the time spent in again. Let me put like an example. 75 00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.070 Jenny Duan: Hello. 76 00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.829 huda: made it something like this. 77 00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:08.350 huda: I think we might need to like, explain it on like another response. 78 00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.119 Jenny Duan: Oh, Gotcha, I mean focusing on one of these 2, 2 or. 79 00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.339 huda: okay, yeah. 80 00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:23.390 Jenny Duan: okay, I think then, we don't need this non",
    "profit founder. And then how many, how much time. Total, have you spent 81 00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.650 huda: like a hundred hours, 200 h, 300 h. 82 00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:42.780 Jenny Duan: 50 h week, maybe like, 100 h. yeah, okay. 83 00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:53.139 Jenny Duan: okay, full click. Okay. So following this, I would say, just, I would say, nonprofit founder again, is this it 84 00:11:53.590 --> 00:12:02.810 huda: and then time, spent how much? I spent more time on this. So I'd say, like, maybe like, 8 HA week. 85 00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.720 Jenny Duan: okay, and how much total time? 86 00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.889 huda: We could put. This is like, maybe like 87 00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.119 huda: 1 80. 88 00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.439 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then teachers, assistant sports volunteer.

And then 92 00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.990 Jenny Duan: let's see. 93 00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.669 Jenny Duan: there's also your game, Cynthoria. 94 00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.739 huda: Yeah, I don't know if that would count as like immunity.

Do you think that counts? 96 00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.370 huda: I think accounts is like a leadership activity? 97 00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:05.940 Jenny Duan: Do you volunteer in any other community organizations, or have you ever in the past like a one day, events, or anything like that? 98 00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:14.699 huda: I've I think I'm volunteered for like a science. 99 00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:22.849 huda: the the size fair. I think that those are 6 h not 6 h, 4 h total 100 00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:31.090 huda: and I was like managing like the students, like setups and everything. I don't know if that counts too muc",
    "h. 101 00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.760 huda: And then 102 00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:45.759 Jenny Duan: maybe I can go to like my services and see what I put. Yeah. Okay. Cool assigns. Signs. Fair. What? What is the name of the signs? Fair? 103 00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.020 huda: It was called Altamont Science Fair. 104 00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.600 Jenny Duan: Can you write that in?

Is there anything else that you want to add. or that you can really slow. But I'll let you know. 109 00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.389 huda: And okay. 110 00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:16.160 huda: courts for humanity, like I think I I made a few, I mean, like a bunch of cards. So I got like 5 h for that. 111 00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.309 But that's like 112 00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.909 not an actual volunteer like 113 00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:33.159 Jenny Duan: is that is that attached to another organization that could count. Is it? Was it attached to another organization? Yeah, I think so. What was the organization name? 114 00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.780 huda: I think it's cords 115 00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.520 isn't cursed for a minute.

But 119 00:16:52.870 --> 00:17:01.340 huda: we find the name. But yeah, so I think, let me think of other things that I might have done. Well. 120 00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:11.079 huda: there was like a disease awareness club and I participated in. I think it was also like another like 121 00:17:11.300 ",
    "--> 00:17:17.250 huda: card like volunteer hour. Where we like remote like hospitals. 122 00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.570 huda: I mean, see, there is more. 123 00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.940 It was the do good feel good.

And then what type of volunteer were you like? Could you be specific like, what type of volunteer lead, volunteer, or anything like that. 127 00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.820 Well. 128 00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.389 huda: I think. 129 00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.440 huda: I think I 130 00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.029 huda: well, it's kind of just like a voluntary event, so like 131 00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:01.580 huda: like 132 00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.239 huda: I don't exactly know like how to name it. So maybe I could be like 133 00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:16.000 huda: a creative answer, since, like I created like cards and 134 00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:24.370 huda: like, I think it was like this. A specific amount was like we have to create cards for like the janitors, over Christmas break. So 135 00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:30.889 huda: like, I mean, like a whole lot. So I think maybe the creative volunteer, if that sounds good. 136 00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.560 Jenny Duan: that sounds good. 137 00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.959 huda: let's see like any. 138 00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.929 huda: But this is only for 41 139 00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.190 huda: characters. 140 00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:12.470 huda: I feel like we should be able to put club cause 141 00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.580 huda: that's what I put for 142 00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.799 huda: like along the service powers. 143 00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:29.759 Jenny Duan: but I think it's fine if you're like in school leadership, if it's if it's here, I think that's fine, though. because I wouldn't try to double",
    " count things. Does that make sense? 144 00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:42.340 huda: Okay, there's also, like, another role I play in like the Muslim Mountain House Muslim Association. Like we had a 145 00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:50.819 huda: like a fundraising event, and I was in charge of like like giving out the food and 146 00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.309 huda: and like taking care of the children in the area. 147 00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.230 huda: Real quick. I was able to log it. But yes. 148 00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.860 Jenny Duan: Is that. Would that count as a school activity, or as a like volunteer thing. 149 00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:11.440 huda: I think it's more of a volunteer thing. It was outside of school. So 150 00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:17.409 huda: about the organization is like, just in our town. So yeah. 151 00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.250 Jenny Duan: you want to write that one in. That sounds like a good fit, too. Okay. 152 00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.270 huda: yeah. 153 00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:59.169 huda: I don't know. Like, what's the word for like taking care of kids cause 154 00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:12.639 huda: babies. Or what do you mean taking care of kids? Yeah, like, I'm like providing like activities and like, educational content. Oh, like 155 00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.820 Jenny Duan: Adrian and child care volunteer. 156 00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.499 huda: Okay, that sounds good. 157 00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.620 Jenny Duan: I'm spend. 158 00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.179 Jenny Duan: And how many activities do they allow you to put in? By the way. 159 00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:34.079 huda: It doesn't say. But like, yeah, at the time 160 00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:41.419 huda: at that, the character Max is 1,000. So it says like over the past 2 years. And 161 00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:49.579 huda: so, yeah, I think that's like, good for the past 2 years. 162 00:21:51.190 --> 00:22:00.010 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, how much time did you spend on this? I think this is a good ",
    "amount of activities. I wouldn't, I think, add more to this unless you have anything else that you can think of. That's big. 163 00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:04.129 huda: I don't. I can't really think of anything like substantial 164 00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.040 huda: but 165 00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.310 huda: yeah. 166 00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.509 Jenny Duan: cool sounds good. 167 00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.690 Jenny Duan: so focusing on 2 organizations.

So 170 00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.470 Jenny Duan: these, I think, are just. Did they give you an example? Format for how you're supposed to write this? 171 00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:39.250 huda: no, but they do. They do have like a 1,000 character maximum.

Usually we'll have like people have like grocery stores and like large corporations around them. But since we're relatively like new as a as this city. 248 00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:07.129 huda: We don't have any of those resources. And then instead to cope like our our community kind of built itself 249 00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:16.189 Jenny Duan: perfect because you wanna leverage your background like saying that you don't have these resources.

These exchanges. 258 00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:06.169 Jenny Duan: I oh, II see what you mean by the were you trying to make a parallel structure with the not so common versus common. 259 00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.870 Jenny Duan: I'm here. all right. 260 00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.709 huda: I know. Yeah. 261 00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.650 Jenny Duan: Inspired by these changes, I created E 262 00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:30.910 Jenny Duan: an opportunity to amplify Muslim businesses which are underrepresented 263 00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:36.050 Jenny Duan: in common shopping decisions. 264 00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.830 Jenny Duan: combining my creative skills 265 00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.199 Jenny Duan: in film making. 266 00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:58.569 Jenny Duan: In journalism. I developed a website. garnered volunteers from across the world 267 00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:04.020 Jenny Duan: and increased business traffic through 268 00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:15.550 Jenny Duan: by amplifying individual stories. 269 00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.430 Jenny Duan: This might be too long. 270 00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.750 Jenny Duan: I think this is gonna be too long. But we can check 271 00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.150 Jenny Duan: 27 characters. Okay, that's 272 00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.040 huda: yeah. 273 00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:45.950 Jenny Duan: Okay. 11 characters. 274 00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:53.190 Jenny Duan: Maybe instead of prospering in sync row. ",
    "yeah. 275 00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.510 huda: from 276 00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.100 huda: different. 277 00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.660 huda: I think that's longer. She. 278 00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.930 Jenny Duan: I created a 279 00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:21.930 Jenny Duan: space 280 00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.000 Jenny Duan: I created. 281 00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.340 Jenny Duan: I 282 00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.930 Jenny Duan: go to. 283 00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.450 Jenny Duan: This is good. 284 00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Well, can you give us a once over and tell me how this feels to you? 285 00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.110 Okay, 286 00:39:54.170 --> 00:40:09.109 huda: oh, both of them. Okay. So I found an empowering AI with the mission to platform girls from sixth to twelfth grade with a network to learn collaborate and access. Some male dominated technology curriculum. 287 00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:20.869 huda: seems like we could change this. It's kind of confusing where it says, email, dominant technology curriculum. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And access a 288 00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.980 Jenny Duan: space. 289 00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.029 Jenny Duan: Or how do we? Yeah. 290 00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:32.150 huda: I think we should, since I talk about the curriculum like after maybe good and access 291 00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.290 huda: a male dominated field. That is technology 292 00:40:40.470 --> 00:41:00.580 huda: like this. With my co-founder we created a full AI and ais curriculum, connecting with young aspiring minds, while also incubating their passions by inspiring others. I not only hope to learn with the curiosity and passion of those we inspire, but also ultimately shape the future of women in technology. 293 00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:14.870 huda: Okay, that sounds good. I think, covers all the points as well. Okay. And then folklift. I also found folklift a platform for small minority, own businesses to grow their from creative media 294 00:41:15",
    ".160 --> 00:41:40.270 huda: in my town. We don't have large corporate stores, rather community members support each other's businesses. Inspired by these exchanges, I started to amplify Muslim businesses which are underrepresented and common shopping decisions. Combining my creative skills in filmmaking and journalism, I developed a website, garnered volunteers from across the world and increased business traffic by amplifying individual stories. 295 00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:46.650 huda: That's really good. I think I think definitely like the last sentence, it like shows like the impact. Most. 296 00:41:47.220 --> 00:42:03.160 Jenny Duan: Oh, awesome. Okay, so this looks good. We this looks good to me for the school. I would say. mom has to be cause people don't know what mh, TV is so. 297 00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:15.489 Jenny Duan: News, chief editor, anchoring Carol.

But let me give this a read over 299 00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.990 Jenny Duan: and even paging 300 00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.300 Jenny Duan: natural. 301 00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:43.910 Jenny Duan: Hey, Rose, I brought my Dolce's school. They don't think we need a comma here in hopes of sharing them with everyone. To my distress everyone grab one, and ran off as chaos entailed in the room. 302 00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.179 Jenny Duan: I love this parallel structure. 303 00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.819 huda: Thank you. I'm really impressive. 304 00:42:50.930 --> 00:43:00.600 Jenny Duan: I've always wanted to be President Barbie, but no matter. The initial passenger drive I had for a cause. My vocal cords, coming down my own vocal cords held me back, however. 305 00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:06.390 Jenny Duan: through 306 00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:11.300 Jenny Duan: through my empowering AI initiative and AI",
    " ethics educational nonprofit 307 00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:17.460 Jenny Duan: where 308 00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:26.660 Jenny Duan: I now collaborate the students across the nation. 309 00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:36.200 Jenny Duan: Maybe like I have become more outspoken. I have found my voice. 310 00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:39.030 huda: You think that 311 00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.040 Jenny Duan: II want to confront. 312 00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:52.710 Jenny Duan: I want to. I feel like I and becoming President Barbie Company. 313 00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.590 Jenny Duan: pause. This. 314 00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.960 Jenny Duan: I think I am becoming, is a little bit more powerful than I want to become. 315 00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.140 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, I think the rest is good. 316 00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:10.930 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what do you think about the rest of the essay? It feels good to me. But yeah, I think I think so. 317 00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:17.119 huda: Yeah, I think we did clarify a bit more on before. 318 00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.200 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. 319 00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:29.179 Jenny Duan: of course, if you in a way, I feel like I still have to do it. I never thought someone like me could do it. 320 00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:41.489 Jenny Duan: Well, yeah. Also, I think for the last essay, number 9. I edited the last 321 00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:49.379 huda: last 2 paragraphs, and I changed it from like the one where I showed my growth. And I couldn't change it to 322 00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.460 huda: kind of like a deeper analysis. So I said. 323 00:44:52.530 --> 00:45:16.499 huda: so said many adolescents have the mindset that if it doesn't affect them. It isn't worth pursuing, and that's exactly the issue. Or that's exactly the issue. Ignorance and apathy play. Today's youth and superficial engagement masks a deeper lack of empathy. And yeah, I use this chat. Pt, sentence, 324 00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:31.849 Jenny Duan: so like, use chat. TV, oka",
    "y, here's the thing, hooda. Some people don't use chat, Gp, and their writing still sounds like chat. Gp, you can use chatty vg, and as long as sounds like you're writing, it doesn't matter. So 325 00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:40.229 huda: okay, a deeper lack of empathy and understanding for critical social issues that affect other people than other people 326 00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.150 huda: dance and sobs. 327 00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:57.970 huda: So it is time time to burst the Perley level, that the adolescence of this generation sit in time to advocate for issues larger than ourselves, because it's not just about ourselves. It's about our future. 328 00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.130 huda: It was really good 329 00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.890 Jenny Duan: about our collective future. 330 00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.080 Jenny Duan: Okay? 331 00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.989 Jenny Duan: Instead of ignoring its presenting. 332 00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.460 Yeah. 333 00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.830 Jenny Duan: what does this bell jar have to do with the rest of the essay. 334 00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.279 huda: It's kind of just like a like a example of like things that like 335 00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.350 huda: it's how 336 00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:47.370 huda: like kids these days, kids these days. But like people young people these days. They don't really like understand things for their like meaning like, which is like more important because the the bell jar is like about like 337 00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:51.339 huda: mental health for females. And it's just like 338 00:46:51.580 --> 00:47:01.629 huda: people don't like reading that book because it's like too serious, and it doesn't affect them. So that's kind of what I went at there. But maybe we could change that. 339 00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.500 Jenny Duan: Did you read this book in class? Or where did you first like? Engage with it? 340 00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:11.509 huda: I read out my own. But like, I think a lot of schools ",
    "do read it in class. 341 00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:17.840 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can 342 00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.250 Jenny Duan: hold open 343 00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.219 Jenny Duan: conversation about 344 00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.709 Jenny Duan: books like the bell jar. 345 00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.370 Jenny Duan: instead of ignoring its representation. 346 00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:39.690 Jenny Duan: I, instead of ignoring representations of female mental health and well being in the media 347 00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:42.380 Jenny Duan: in in media? 348 00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.620 Jenny Duan: Okay. 349 00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:52.289 Jenny Duan: hmm, I guess. Does that make more sense? Does this? Does the sentence make sense, or does is this not cohesive. 350 00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.890 Jenny Duan: yeah. 351 00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:11.500 huda: I think we could remove it. Overall, because I feel like like you said it doesn't like it. The specific example might confuse people cause like they might think that I'm talking about how people don't care about female mental health. Maybe we could remove that. 352 00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:19.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think we should add another sentence instead. 4 days one. 353 00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.060 huda: What's another example? 354 00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.479 huda: maybe like 355 00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:39.770 huda: My peers will change their profile pictures and think it's like, I mean, like 356 00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:48.870 huda: I'm kind of talk about like I think there's a good channel like Blackout Tuesday, where just change your profile pictures. So maybe like 357 00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:53.379 huda: our 50 days were 358 00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.130 huda: I mean, it's kind of similar. So in in for infographing so like. 359 00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.450 huda: maybe not that find. 360 00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.969 huda: I think it's fine.

I heard the arser from a shop they're showing us. Bossy wasn't surprised. 369 00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:08.989 Jenny Duan: but he obviously cares about. 370 00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:19.129 Jenny Duan: but issue with them is that they become so self involved with their jokes and trivial matters that they fail to look outside them 371 00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:29.000 Jenny Duan: sort of mature, but what ages it recognizes ignorance. Large maturity is ex is exposure to different is exp is exposure to 372 00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:35.150 Jenny Duan: those 373 00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:38.639 Jenny Duan: different from ourselves. 374 00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.319 Jenny Duan: Cynthia always often sets her empathy, and when younger people cannot express the same issues. 375 00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:53.080 Jenny Duan: And then they don't advocate for them many adolescents 376 00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.410 Jenny Duan: here 377 00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.380 Jenny Duan: urge to change 378 00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:11.859 Jenny Duan: often stems from everything, and when you hear people around the world they don't advocate for them. But if something 379 00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.110 Jenny Duan: doesn't affect them. 380 00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.920 Jenny Duan: Okay,",
    " I think this looks good to me. Can you give us a once over and let me know what you think? 381 00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:47.010 huda: Okay, I pray for days where my peers read the infographics they post and start performative activism hidden behind a social media facade. I pray for days when young people develop empathy and care for issues concerning life, instead of being consumed by their own superciliousness. In my school there is a club devoted to spreading awareness of disabilities. The President happened to sit at my computer science table 382 00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:59.540 huda: one day, he, he! While he and his friends were bantering, I heard the Arsler de derogatory term towards the disabled community which he isn't part of from his mouth. Maybe I can remove this from his. 383 00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.299 Jenny Duan: I think you can find anything. You can keep it. It's okay. 384 00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.429 Maybe you can say I heard him. I heard him 385 00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.700 Jenny Duan: save the arser. How's that? 386 00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.820 huda: Yeah. 387 00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:17.429 huda: I feel like, but this part I don't know from his mouth. 388 00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:34.710 huda: Sounds kind of weird. You can delete that like. Instead of writing from his math, you can just say I heard him say, Yes, okay, it was shocking to see someone who displayed such a nuanced and shareitable front disrespecting the community he wants advocated for. But honestly, I wasn't surprised. 389 00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:50.689 huda: was a lighthearted joke. Yes, he's just a boy. Yes, he obviously still cares about issues larger than himself. Yes, the issue with young people today is that they become so self involved with themselves, with their jokes and trivial matters, that they look fail to look outside of them. 390 00:52:50.740 --> 00:53:03.639 huda: The word word immature is often associated with younger ages, but at what age is it recognizes ignorance. A la",
    "rge part of maturity is exposure to diff to those different from ourselves, the courage to change 391 00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:07.740 huda: the courage for change. Baby. 392 00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:09.030 Jenny Duan: yeah. 393 00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:21.650 huda: For change often stems from empathy, and when younger people cannot experience the same issues as those around the world they don't advocate for them. Many added license have 394 00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:42.920 huda: the mind said that if something doesn't affect them it isn't worth pursuing. That's the exact issue. Ignorance and apathy play. Today's youth and superficial engagement makes a deeper lack masks, a deeper lack of empathy and understanding for critical social issues that affect people other than themselves. So it is time to reverse the pearly bubble that that 395 00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:57.169 huda: the adolescence of this generation sit in to advocate for issues larger than ourselves, because it's not just about ourselves. It's about our collective future. 396 00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:02.369 huda: It's all great. That's really good, really powerful essay. 397 00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:14.369 huda: Thank you. Do you think I'm like doing too much like parallelism and like repetition. So I feel like I do that a lot. It's a sign of like good and mature writing. 398 00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.660 huda: Thank you. 399 00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:27.730 Jenny Duan: Why do you want to be a bank of America student leader? And why should you be chosen? Of course, if you feed my kids and everything, but in a way I feel like I still got to do what I'm passionate about at at this point 400 00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:36.010 Jenny Duan: her folklift and it shows her to highlight, small Muslim own businesses in my community, their passion for journalism I saw I 401 00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.839 Jenny Duan: so an opportunity to shape change to storytelling. 402 00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:50.210 Jenny Duan: Right then it struck me that p",
    "eople care. People care about what they see in the world, and who, far as a new generation of leaders, divers leadership, and by the exchange of new ideas in area. This is so good 403 00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.110 and fixing affairs in the 404 00:54:54.320 --> 00:55:10.549 Jenny Duan: gender equality and cultural inclusion. 405 00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:23.590 Jenny Duan: This is perfect. I think I also read over this before. This is very good. Okay, I think at this point you are ready to submit. oh, sorry. This like keeps turning on 406 00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.640 Jenny Duan: yeah. 407 00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:49.050 Jenny Duan: do you? Wanna maybe I think at this point I'm I'm approving your essays. Sorry. I know it's loud outside. I'm approving your essays to submit. So I would say, once you have a chance, I would get one more. Read over everything. And then, once you feel like you're ready, I would say you can submit everything, and I would do so earlier rather than later. Just in case there are any technical issues with the actual submission process. 408 00:55:49.250 --> 00:56:02.569 huda: Yeah, I think I'll I'll have like my sister read over it and ask for like what she thinks. And then, yeah, I'll I'll be able to submit it. I think I might. I I'll do like maybe tomorrow, day after tomorrow. 409 00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:24.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds really good. And then after this, I think for us, just like a look ahead. It's gonna be probably like application writing for the next couple of weeks. So they know that there is other stuff coming up that I think we can focus on so I think the next upcoming deadline is Notre Dame. Is that correct? Or is there one before that? 410 00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.609 huda: I think it's Notre Dame. Yeah. 411 00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:34.139 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think so. I think Notre Dame should be the focus next. And then, whenever you get the chance, I would try to 412 00:56:34.260 --> 00:57:01.539 Jenny Duan: the grip. T",
    "ape application should be really quick. What that is is. It's $500 to like, basically do whatever you want and learn anything that you want. I think it could be good. If you want to buy some like film equipment. If you want to buy some music production like software or something like that. I did it. And I used the money to buy like a camera, a blogging camera. And I used it to make like 2 Youtube videos. So I think it's a good experience. It's really easy to apply. You just submit a video like a short video. 413 00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:14.180 Jenny Duan: If I remember quickly, so I would try to look at that. The hackathon I would definitely apply for the one in Boston. It's coming up. I think. I sent you a link for that that should be free, they should be able. You should be able to get a reimbursement for them to fly you out to go. 414 00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.620 Jenny Duan: I think. Have you ever traveled by yourself before? No. 415 00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:42.750 Jenny Duan: I think you should take this opportunity and go hack Club is this is not a scam organization. This is like a real organization hat club. I think I've talked to you, maybe briefly about it before my sister did Hack Club. I think my sister might. I'll tell her to go to this conference or this Hackathon. But if you go to the hackathon, it's a good experience, because you can win prizes, you can connect with other students. And it's just fun, because they usually will like cover your travel so you can go there and like code for a weekend 416 00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:57.070 Jenny Duan: and that should be really fun. Hack Club has like a really supportive female community, too. So you should be able to meet a lot of like young women programmers, too. So that's what that is. And then the Nyu program is like for the future. But that's something to keep in mind as well, too. 417 00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:58.730 huda: Okay. 418 00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:19.839 huda: yeah. I think that sounds great. I did like I",

But like other than that, do you have like any things for me to specifically work on till the next time we meet. 419 00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:43.049 Jenny Duan: I don't think so. I think just I'll take a look at your college list, and I'll be prepared with some feedback for next time. Alright, yeah, thanks so much. Have a good evening. I know we've been a little extra time. So thanks for staying on. But I think ready. Just let me know when you submit them. And yeah, I'll see you on Saturday. Alright, thank you. Bye, bye."
