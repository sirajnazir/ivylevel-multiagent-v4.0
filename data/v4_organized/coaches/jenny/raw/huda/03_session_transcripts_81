It's my obsession. 52 00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:24.359 Jenny Duan: Where did you like? Where did you glimpse the transformative power of personalized education through what I think you have like 5 words left. You can write, maybe, like one example of where you watched it, or like something that you've done that's furthered. It. 53 00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:35.119 huda: Yeah, I think like, I was previously referencing, like synthoria with coding like educational games. So maybe I can just say, like through the game I developed synthoria. 54 00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:39.900 Jenny Duan: Sworn from to an everyday phase 55 00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.529 Jenny Duan: as I developed synthuria. 56 00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.099 Jenny Duan: This is perfect.

Just added a short mention of synthoria. And then, if they want to learn more about it. They can look at your activity section, but that's not necessary. 60 00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.857 huda: Should I add, like my game here, so that it might be like 61 00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.449 huda: little more clear. 62 00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.850 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's good 63 00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.630 Jenny Duan: room. 64 00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.450 huda: Oh, okay, that's 1 50 words exactly. 65 00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.200 Jenny Duan: Great 66 00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.050 Jenny Duan: wait. I feel like this is a little bit 67 00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.609 Jenny Duan: of repetition from the previous essay. 68 00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Instead of neural networks, you can use a different thing. 69 00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.180 huda: One. 70 00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.870 huda: Maybe, like I don't know, like giving a specific example is like. 71 00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.380 Jenny Duan: This is good, this is good. 72 00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.080 huda: Okay. 73 00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.140 Jenny Duan: Great. This makes a lot of sense. I feel like you really got it. 74 00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:39.670 huda: Cute. 75 00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.379 Jenny Duan: And it's exactly 1 50 words. 76 00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:44.830 Jenny Duan: Honestly, I have no nothing to say about this. 77 00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.339 Jenny Duan: This is really good, short, and sweet. 78 00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.310 huda: Okay.

And then and like the turby gave like, an email as well. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention, Unc does like they have like this, like Fafsa pre, like, like the Beta version, so that they send out this form where I can like put like Fsa ids, and see like my eligibility, so hopefully, that'll be coming in like soon. And I can kind of figure out for, like the rest of the schools as well. But yeah. 89 00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 90 00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:57.309 Jenny Duan: okay. Great, amazing. So 91 00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:03.010 Jenny Duan: so proud. Next thing I, this is, these are all your early schools right?

Right? 94 00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:20.939 Jenny Duan: Okay, we can take a breather cause your early round is done, Huda. I'm so happy. Okay, but it's not really a breather, because now I'm about to dump a lot more work on you, unfortunately or fortunately. But 95 00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.000 Jenny Duan: yeah, there's there's more to be done? Can you share your elk stuff with me? 96 00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.210 huda: Yeah. 97 00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:37.360 Jenny Duan: I really, Huda, I think you would be the perfect candidate for this. I really want you to apply for this, but it's not open yet, but when it's open. 98 00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.720 Jenny Duan: keep an eye out. 99 00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.130 huda: Oh, okay. 100 00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.540 huda: own. 101 00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.010 huda: I think it 102 00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.390 huda: open. 103 00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.120 huda: And October 28.th 104 00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:55.580 Jenny Duan: Oh, it is open shoot it is. Oh, my gosh, it's already October 28.th Okay, this is another big priority for you. 105 00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:09.219 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest thing with like with scholarship applications is you need to make sure that your letters of recommend your recommenders can get their stuff in on time. So that's like the most going to be the most critical component, like ensuring that your recommenders get their stuff in 106 00:14:10.156 --> 00:14:13.539 Jenny Duan: because I am confident in your writing ability. But 107 00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.230 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's just 108 00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.089 Jenny Duan: it has to be about your 109 00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.209 Jenny Duan: your recommender is getting it in time. 110 00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.980 Jenny Duan: okay. 111 00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:34.409 Jenny Duan: I'm on your elk stocks. This is basically for Elks. You can kind of just use your personal statement like, that's basically what I did for my elks thing. 112 00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:40.620 Jenny Duan: just like, shorten your personal statement, and make it 500 words and fit it to the prompt. A bit. 113 00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.099 huda: Okay, yeah, I think that makes sense. And so the extracurricular that I will be like in focus would be Cynthoria. 114 00:14:47.372 --> 00:14:59.359 Jenny Duan: Can you copy paste your personal statement here? And then we can honestly just fill this in and turn it in today, like it's this is pretty low lift. I think the most difficult thing about scholarship applications is just populating all the Ecs 115 00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.409 Jenny Duan: cause that just like is time intensive. But since you already have all of yours written too, it shouldn't be a big deal. 116 00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.190 Jenny Duan: Alright. 117 00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.920 huda: And it's 500 words so like 118 00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.370 huda: a little bit of. 119 00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.340 Jenny Duan: Shortening. Yeah. 120 00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.690 Jenny Duan: have you heard anything back from Cameron impact. 121 00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.170 huda: No, I haven't actually. 122 00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.050 Jenny Duan: It's so weird. 123 00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.410 huda: Yeah. 124 00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.655 Jenny Duan: Okay. 125 00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.279 Jenny Duan: Let me see. Yeah. 126 00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.370 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 127 00:15:49.810 --> 00:16:02.450 huda: Wait. Actually, can we? Make a list of like the scholarships I'm applying to, so that I can like inform my counselor, like which ones she has to turn the trans. Turn the transcript in for. 128 00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:09.520 Jenny Duan: Yes, I believe we have this on your on the notion. So let me, just 129 00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.010 Jenny Duan: I need to like find the page.

I don't know if it means that it like already finished, or if it hasn't started yet. 141 00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.590 Jenny Duan: It hasn't started yet. This one's pretty late, like. 142 00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:26.990 Jenny Duan: If you scroll down, you can see that, like the application deadline for this year was Tuesday, April 23, rd 2024. So I assume this will maybe be in the spring of next year. 143 00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.589 huda: Oh, okay. 144 00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 145 00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.180 Jenny Duan: Oh. 146 00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.929 Jenny Duan: let me just like populate some stuff 147 00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.100 Jenny Duan: a lot of these are like 148 00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.080 Jenny Duan: for the future. 149 00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.330 Jenny Duan: not open. 150 00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:20.910 huda: Hmm. 151 00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:32.320 Jenny Duan: The ge weekend foundation is due in January, so I feel like that's a big one. 152 00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.080 Jenny Duan: Alright.

So like, which extra curriculum should I put in each one? I think? 220 00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.796 huda: this one just seems like 221 00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.140 huda: like volunteering, I think. 222 00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.480 huda: and then this one's 223 00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:32.739 huda: like leadership roles. 224 00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.730 Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah. 225 00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.370 Jenny Duan: agreed. 226 00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:57.569 huda: Okay? And then these are awards. And then these are jobs also. This is similar to like with the Mit application. I asked for, it has a couple of section for jobs. But I don't really have like any experience with jobs so like, Will that like negatively impact me. 227 00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.029 Jenny Duan: No, it won't. It's okay. 228 00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:00.940 huda: Okay. 229 00:32:02.602 --> 00:32:04.780 huda: Then I'll just like, List the. 230 00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.699 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think you went to this 231 00:32:22.081 --> 00:32:26.009 Jenny Duan: later and just submit it. I don't think you need to do it right now. 232 00:32:26.939 --> 00:32:30.619 Jenny Duan: Like, since it's just plugging in numbers or plugging in words. 233 00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.330 Jenny Duan: Okay. Next thing we can talk about is 234 00:32:41.353 --> 00:32:45.379 Jenny Duan: low key, like, maybe the Amazon future engineers. 235 00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:46.620 huda: Okay. 236 00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.029 Jenny Duan: Needs a letter of recommendation. 237 00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.650 huda: Okay, I think I need to like log in. 238 00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.200 huda: Okay? 239 00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:04.140 Jenny Duan: Can you maybe share your screen once you've started that way, we or like, put the questions into a doc. 240 00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.800 huda: Yeah.

Maybe if she can like change it a little bit. But 247 00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.000 huda: yeah, for these. 248 00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:21.720 huda: I'll ask her before sending the recommendation form, though, so that she knows like that she has to upload it. 249 00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.880 huda: yeah. But like. Let me see if there's 250 00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.350 huda: like other 251 00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.770 huda: things I have to add. 252 00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.650 huda: Are there any essays for this one or no? 253 00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.220 Jenny Duan: Oh, there's definitely, there's definitely essays. 254 00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.900 Jenny Duan: documents. 255 00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.860 Jenny Duan: We go back to scholarships and then click the Amazon future engineers. 256 00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.260 Jenny Duan: Oh. 257 00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.530 huda: I think because I already 258 00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.290 huda: click to apply. 259 00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.989 Jenny Duan: Wait.

And then there's always some like 283 00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:18.469 huda: like unique ones like this one. 284 00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.660 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 285 00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.270 huda: I actually like this question. 286 00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.000 Jenny Duan: Which one. 287 00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:43.979 huda: Thank you. 288 00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.000 Jenny Duan: Your principles. 289 00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.860 huda: Yeah. 290 00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:55.190 Jenny Duan: This is basically just like engineering. It's like the Usc engineering challenges one like they always have, like some type of this where they're like, how do you fit in within the context of Xyz. 291 00:40:55.870 --> 00:41:16.219 huda: Yeah, I think for this one, I'll I could approach it with like a similar kind of stance about like how we have, like an issue where we don't have that many teachers especially in the Cs department. And so, like we can like, I can use like game development. I guess, to counter that. And I guess, like 292 00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:20.490 huda: build tools for students like when they don't have teachers. 293 00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.630 Jenny Duan: Buried 294 00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:32.390 Jenny Duan: this. So so I just pasted this in in. You have about 330 characters left here. 295 00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.829 Jenny Duan: so you can. Just 296 00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.130 Jenny Duan: do you think you'll be able to elaborate on this a little bit. 297 00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.939 huda: Yeah. Maybe. 298 00:41:49.720 --> 00:42:09.870 Jenny Duan: You can talk about like, you know, in your personal statement you described like the people who came to to empower her hacks. You can talk about like maybe empower her hacks. You can talk like this. One is just like, try to hit all the diversity cards that you can like. You're an immigrant like, maybe you speak a different language at home like you, you interacted with people with all different cultures like you're multicultural 299 00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.490 Jenny Duan: like, just try to yeah. 300 00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.700 Jenny Duan: get diversity points here. 301 00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:33.520 huda: Yeah, do you think like, it's actually, I know, I think it's not really Stem related. But if I were to like mention, like eld to kind of somehow like bring up like that. I'm an immigrant. Would that be worth it? But since I guess, since it's not stem, it might not really help. 302 00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 303 00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.299 huda: Let me see. 304 00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.990 huda: I think 305 00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.175 huda: so. 306 00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:14.669 huda: Oh, wait! How would I bring up, like other like different diversity points through like the empower hacks? Organization. 307 00:43:15.998 --> 00:43:36.029 Jenny Duan: You can talk about like interacting with people from all different cultures. And how like you, you founded this organization, you you discovered that like, there's people from like. How many, however, many countries represented, and they all have something to bring, and that taught you about like the importance of diverse values. When pursuing stem, because, like their ideas, help contribute to like you, seeing problems in a different way. 308 00:43:37.026 --> 00:43:56.589 huda: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. And then maybe like, I was thinking, what if I can talk about like someone who is from the Uae cause. I know that I think there was someone from empower hacks was also from the Uae and I can talk about like how I was also born there, and like 309 00:43:56.959 --> 00:44:01.910 huda: how I immigrate like I I could just like somehow, like kind of weave that in. 310 00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.090 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. 311 00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.600 Jenny Duan: that sounds good. 312 00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:14.769 huda: Okay? And then for this last essay, actually, I don't know if there's an additional information for this one. 313 00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:17.260 huda: But 314 00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.589 huda: if there are she? 315 00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.080 huda: Oh, yeah, this is the additional information. So I can just talk about like how 316 00:45:24.434 --> 00:45:30.450 huda: use basically to use the same like additional information that I've been using, and then also mentioned how 317 00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:33.160 huda: like 318 00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.840 huda: I'll mention how like it's like inspired me to like make 319 00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.240 huda: free education available. I guess. 320 00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:49.329 Jenny Duan: let me look at the Amazon. Future engineers like their criteria, 321 00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.926 Jenny Duan: the other thing about this is that's really cool is that this gives you 322 00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:13.199 Jenny Duan: like a guaranteed internship after your freshman year of college at Amazon. 323 00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:14.530 huda: Wow! 324 00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:22.790 Jenny Duan: So that's like pretty cool. So not only do you get $40,000. You also get a guaranteed internship, a paid internship. 325 00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:24.850 huda: Wow! I hope I get it. 326 00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:26.090 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 327 00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:31.050 Jenny Duan: I hope you get it like, this is the perfect opportunity for you. It really is. 328 00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:32.300 Jenny Duan: So. 329 00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.989 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I really hope that you get it. 330 00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.116 huda: Thank you. 331 00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:51.349 Jenny Duan: It's okay. And so yeah, I think for the additional information, just like, emphasize your like, financial need emphasize rural town like, basically, you just need to hit as many diversity points as you can here and like, just emphasize your background because it's for like 332 00:46:51.860 --> 00:47:01.380 Jenny Duan: is for like underserved students. And so I feel like you are a really good fit for this because of your background, too, like it's it's a really good mutual fit. And so I 333 00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.928 Jenny Duan: like you should. You should. 334 00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:05.930 Jenny Duan: you know. Be good. 335 00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.520 Jenny Duan: Okay. 336 00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.679 huda: yeah, I feel like these. These essays are also like a little intimidating. But. 337 00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.060 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 338 00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:20.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, which leadership principle do you think you want to write about. 339 00:47:22.012 --> 00:47:24.130 huda: Let me take a look. Here. 340 00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:33.419 Jenny Duan: Or you don't have to directly respond to a leadership principle. But, like, what's the problem in your school that could be solved? I think you said lack of Cs teachers? Right? 341 00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.380 huda: Yeah, and also, yeah, like. 342 00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:45.459 huda: lack of Cs teachers, like, there's like an abundance of people that want to learn. Cs, so there's like curious people. But like they just. 343 00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:53.590 huda: they don't really have like the resources to like kind of learn new things. And so I'd like to build like tools. 344 00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:58.620 huda: so that there's like a whole like lesson plans like like a whole, I guess. 345 00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.560 huda: Syllabus, maybe even about like 346 00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:06.189 huda: like what to learn through gamified learning 347 00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:25.529 huda: and wait. Are these supposed to be answered more straightforward or through like like a story, kind. 348 00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.310 Jenny Duan: I think, mix like, start with the story, and then go straight forward. 349 00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:31.640 huda: Okay. 350 00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:46.519 Jenny Duan: Like. It's not like you. I don't think you have enough, because they're so short, like I think stories are only super effective when you have like a lot of characters to write about it and to bring it out. But like, since you don't have a lot of characters, you don't. 351 00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.619 Jenny Duan: But you can't just write a story because you don't. You just don't have enough space for that. 352 00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.860 huda: Yeah. 353 00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.379 Jenny Duan: Okay, and then describe your career goals and aspirations. This is like pretty straightforward, I think. 354 00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.440 huda: Almost like I've written like a couple. 355 00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, you've written so many of these, like, I think. 356 00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:02.050 huda: Yeah. 357 00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.160 Jenny Duan: You've got this. 358 00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:09.470 huda: Like you use one of them, or like I mean, like, maybe just make it more like stem facing. I guess. 359 00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:23.679 Jenny Duan: Yeah, stemify it. Make it? Cs, because this is like for Amazon to hire like they wanna hire software. They're hiring software engineers from this. So focus on gaming. But also, maybe like, write about like problem solving or like other software engineer stuff. Because, like 360 00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:27.129 Jenny Duan: this is in a software engineering internship. So that's like 361 00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.660 Jenny Duan: the type of students that they're interested in, too. 362 00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:36.719 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you feel comfortable with this? Do you have any other questions about this specific one? 363 00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:43.629 Jenny Duan: I feel like there's just gonna be a lot of writing, but I feel like, since you already have a big background with writing essays like 364 00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:56.620 Jenny Duan: with scholarships. It's just kind of like copy pasting things like reworking it, and then like doing the manual copy paste for all the activities. That's what I remember. I remember like the hardest part about doing scholarships is just like all the copy pasting, like everything back and forth. 365 00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:57.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 366 00:49:58.006 --> 00:50:04.359 huda: Yeah, I mean, I don't think I have any questions. I think I'll try and write like, a draft of these essays. 367 00:50:04.984 --> 00:50:09.850 huda: But yeah, I think I think this is a good like framework to move forward. 368 00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:16.590 Jenny Duan: Okay here, there's more when you think there's not more, there's there's more. So. 369 00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:19.550 Jenny Duan: yeah. 370 00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:24.490 Jenny Duan: Burger King. Yay, new one. 371 00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.100 Jenny Duan: So 372 00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:31.328 Jenny Duan: yeah, here's Burger King. Do you wanna make an account. 373 00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:32.990 huda: Yes, 374 00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:35.900 huda: Hold on. 375 00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:43.440 huda: bye! 376 00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:12.130 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 377 00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:21.955 huda: Okay. 378 00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:27.100 huda: you, too. 379 00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.129 Jenny Duan: Okay, can you share that. 380 00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:32.490 huda: Oh, doc. Okay. 381 00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:33.790 Jenny Duan: Never mind, you can just. 382 00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.119 Jenny Duan: And there should be essays here. So 383 00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:42.030 Jenny Duan: also, what is this work? Experiences? Section I really forgot what is application look like when I go. 384 00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:44.160 huda: Oh, okay. 385 00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.340 Jenny Duan: Okay, you don't have. If you if you don't have any work experience, you don't have to put that in. It's okay. 386 00:52:48.975 --> 00:52:52.660 Jenny Duan: Look at the personal statement. I think that's the main thing. 387 00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:56.729 Jenny Duan: Oh, I remember this, this is really short. 388 00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.070 Jenny Duan: yeah. 389 00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.300 huda: One essa. 390 00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:08.569 Jenny Duan: 1 51. I think it's 1,500 characters, not even words. I remember this is like a 1 paragraph when I wrote it, so. 391 00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:09.160 huda: Yeah. 392 00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 393 00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.580 huda: I'll make a document anyways. 394 00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.510 Jenny Duan: Wait, wait, what is this? 395 00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:25.849 Jenny Duan: I'm confused about this like video recording thing because it says the statement or video will not be used in selecting recipients. 396 00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.200 huda: Wait! 397 00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.820 Jenny Duan: I'm like, wait, that's kind of confusing. 398 00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.579 Jenny Duan: Do you? Do you see this? The statement or video will not be used in selecting recipients for any of the awards. 399 00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.440 huda: Oh. 400 00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:44.670 huda: yeah. 401 00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:49.109 Jenny Duan: Wait. So what are they using to to select, to select recipients 402 00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:53.670 Jenny Duan: my concern? Let me look at their FAQ really quickly. 403 00:53:55.890 --> 00:54:01.060 Jenny Duan: Because, like, how are they selecting recipients if they're not reading your essays? Question, Mark. 404 00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.110 Jenny Duan: Hi. 405 00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:05.710 huda: Oh! 406 00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.789 Jenny Duan: Okay. Oh, what? 407 00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.400 huda: So. Not at all. It's not 408 00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.070 huda: really. Oh. 409 00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:14.519 Jenny Duan: What are they awarded for. 410 00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.339 huda: Academic achievements, participation in school and community. 411 00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.639 Jenny Duan: Activity, work, experience. 412 00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.840 Jenny Duan: Well, okay, well, you don't have any work experience. But. 413 00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:27.170 huda: Yeah. 414 00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:40.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, whatever. You have a good extracurriculars. So it's like, it's like, whatever, okay, maybe like, don't spend so much time on this. Then, because this seems like a bit like unserious compared to the other one compared to the other one. 415 00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:41.469 huda: Yeah, like. 416 00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:47.661 Jenny Duan: It's it's like silly and goofy like, just apply. Why not? Okay? I'm not really concerned. You can just write whatever you want for 417 00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.449 Jenny Duan: The personal statement not used at all, apparently. 418 00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.630 huda: I think I could like I could even record video. Maybe. 419 00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:06.870 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like a 2 min video or something like, okay, just write like a like a something random or do like a random record. They're not using it. So it doesn't really matter. 420 00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:12.159 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is just whatever I don't think we should spend too much time on this. 421 00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:14.169 Jenny Duan: Okay, next one. 422 00:55:15.355 --> 00:55:15.760 huda: Okay. 423 00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.999 Jenny Duan: It's just gonna keep on like going for 424 00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.980 Jenny Duan: the next couple of months. 425 00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:30.240 Jenny Duan: So I think biggest things right now are getting the Elks in getting Amazon future engineers getting equitable. And then after that, after these 3 main ones oh, and 426 00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:36.169 Jenny Duan: the Reagan scholar! But the Reagan Foundation is a little bit later. I think our focus should be like 427 00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:41.760 Jenny Duan: Amazon, because that's $40,000 equitable cause that's $20,000. And 428 00:55:42.393 --> 00:55:49.499 Jenny Duan: what's Elk? Because that's also like $20,000 like those are like big scholarships that you should apply for. Everything else is kind of just like. 429 00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:59.880 Jenny Duan: take it or leave it. It's fine and then, after we finish these 3, we should go back to your Uc essays and also your regular decisions that are coming up. 430 00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:01.959 huda: Yeah, it's so. 431 00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.680 Jenny Duan: Your oh, sorry! Go ahead! 432 00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.760 huda: Wait, which which 3 scholarships do. We need to work on before you cease. 433 00:56:09.412 --> 00:56:15.207 Jenny Duan: Amazon. I'm not, maybe not before, but like alongside Amazon, equitable and 434 00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:22.739 Jenny Duan: and Elks those are the 3 like with the biggest monetary awards associated 435 00:56:24.128 --> 00:56:26.099 Jenny Duan: and then the other thing is. 436 00:56:26.688 --> 00:56:30.040 Jenny Duan: did you get your fee waivers? Waivers? Approved. 437 00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:30.820 huda: Yes. 438 00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:34.519 Jenny Duan: Okay, that means for regular. You can basically apply to like 439 00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:42.370 Jenny Duan: as many schools as you want, because you have the waivers. So like northeastern. No essays. That's an application like 440 00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:44.070 Jenny Duan: alright. 441 00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:45.170 huda: And actually. 442 00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:50.609 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! You already submitted. But you didn't tell me this. We so now you're at how many schools like 5 schools done. 443 00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:57.659 huda: Yeah, that's northeastern Unc. Sanford, Usc. And Uic. 444 00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:58.780 huda: 5. 445 00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 5 schools. Okay, cool. 446 00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:07.749 Jenny Duan: So you have 5 schools done like, that's awesome. Basically, you can apply to like 2030 schools like as many as the common app supports. Because 447 00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:27.610 Jenny Duan: I don't know. I feel like once you start writing essays like it's gonna be pretty easy to like churn them out so like like you can just like, if you want, you can apply to like all the ivy leagues you can apply to, like all the top 20 schools if you want to like, it just depends because you have the waivers. So it doesn't really like matter that much. So why not just like, go crazy if you want to. 448 00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:35.034 huda: Yeah. The only only thing I'm like I'm worried about is like adding, like my counselor and recommenders like these new schools, because 449 00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.199 Jenny Duan: No, but they write one essay for all your schools. They just send the information over. 450 00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:53.819 huda: I think they have to do it again, though, because I think they submitted it to all the ones that I already have in my list. So I think I'll just have to remind them again. But I think to remind them for the scholarships. So yeah. 451 00:57:54.140 --> 00:58:04.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's fine, just like, get on good terms like, write. Thank you. Cards. Write Christmas cards, get them like gifts, not expensive gifts, but like, get them some like flowers. Get them some chocolate like they just, you know. 452 00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:04.620 huda: Yeah. 453 00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:09.480 Jenny Duan: Like they're gonna have to help you a lot like that's just how it is going to be. But 454 00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:14.999 Jenny Duan: I think all students in your position are demanding a lot from their campuses right now. 455 00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:21.200 Jenny Duan: but I think that's why. Just like be mindful about giving them a heads up as soon as possible. 456 00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:32.700 Jenny Duan: But if you need, like a letter of recommendation for them to get it in. Okay, cool, equitable excellence. It's a great program like, I'm I got a scholarship from them. They're like, really great. 457 00:58:33.095 --> 00:58:36.180 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 5,000 a year. It's pretty good. 458 00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:36.570 huda: Wow! 459 00:58:36.783 --> 00:58:41.060 Jenny Duan: How many is this? The only essay that you have to write, and how many characters or words is this. 460 00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:46.660 huda: Yes, it's the only one, and there's a thousand characters. Oh, well, there's. 461 00:58:46.660 --> 00:59:02.990 Jenny Duan: So short. Oh, my gosh, that is so short. And then this see, like this, financial circumstances is basically the same exact essay that you'll submit for Amazon that you'll submit, for, like everything else. So you just copy paste. That and 1,000 characters is really short. Can you share this document with me? 462 00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.080 huda: Yes. 463 00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.420 Jenny Duan: And also put the contact id level, like whatever customer support. 464 00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.650 Jenny Duan: Can you put this in the chat. 465 00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:13.190 huda: Yes. 466 00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:14.360 huda: and. 467 00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.609 Jenny Duan: Alright. Thank you so much. 468 00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:26.139 Jenny Duan: okay, 1,000 characters is really short. Okay. 469 00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.990 Jenny Duan: let me see what I wrote for this. I don't even remember. 470 00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:43.350 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think they were different essays. 471 00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:47.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, if you want, you can read my essays. 472 00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.800 Jenny Duan: let me just 473 00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.250 Jenny Duan: and 474 00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:51.770 Jenny Duan: put them in chat. 475 00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.630 Jenny Duan: I don't. But these are different. These are different essays. 476 00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:58.890 Jenny Duan: So 477 00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.230 Jenny Duan: yeah. 478 01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:12.329 huda: Well, I guess that I guess that the 1st one's kind of like they're kind of all. They're both kind of like similar, because. 479 01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:14.660 huda: Questions about like 480 01:00:16.274 --> 01:00:17.490 huda: enhancing. 481 01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.040 huda: It's about like. 482 01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:27.040 huda: how do you plan to pay it forward and inspire others in your community to inspire their own college education? 483 01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:38.000 Jenny Duan: I think, for this one you can talk about like being from Mountain House, California, this like small town, and like how you've created opportunities here. I feel like you've written similar essays. So you can kind of just like like 484 01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.670 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Go hang there. 485 01:00:43.220 --> 01:01:01.350 huda: Should I also mention like or I don't know if I'll have space, but like like Mht jobs, and like that was also one way that I was. Well, I guess that doesn't really like relate to like pursuing like college education. So yeah, I think like empowering. AI might be like a better. 486 01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:07.660 Jenny Duan: I, empowering the air and say, like, you will continue to do this with like the tools that you gain from your education experience. 487 01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.289 Jenny Duan: it's only 1,000 characters so like you really don't have very much 488 01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.590 Jenny Duan: room to say that to say too much. 489 01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:17.680 Jenny Duan: No. 490 01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:18.255 huda: Yeah. 491 01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.780 Jenny Duan: Maybe talk about like what you want to study in college and like 492 01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:28.770 Jenny Duan: and like. Why, it's so important to you. Maybe like you're the 1st to to do your degree in the United States right? 493 01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:36.579 Jenny Duan: I can't talk about that, but you can also leave that for the second essay. The second 1,000 words where it asks about your like. Special circumstances, too. 494 01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:37.760 huda: Yeah. 495 01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.094 huda: I'll try and get whatever in the 1,000 characters. But. 496 01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.267 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, cool. I feel like. 497 01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:50.569 Jenny Duan: maybe next time we meet, you can just have rough drafts of these essays. 498 01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.720 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's 499 01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.909 Jenny Duan: is that is that an okay target for the next time we meet. 500 01:01:56.622 --> 01:02:02.109 huda: Okay, so which ones should I prioritize the Amazon ones? Or should I prioritize. 501 01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:04.279 Jenny Duan: Elks cause that has the 1st deadline. 502 01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.120 huda: Okay, yeah, I mean, but we also are. 503 01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:14.860 Jenny Duan: Oh, but we're like already done, I think, for else you can honestly like. Just submit it whenever you want to like. I don't really think that one is 504 01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.320 Jenny Duan: like. It's only one essay, your comments already good. So it's like, I don't know 505 01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.180 Jenny Duan: not. 506 01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:20.720 huda: Yeah. 507 01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:24.860 Jenny Duan: Not that much you can like. Do really, you know. 508 01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:32.209 huda: Yeah, I just need to get my counselor. I just need to make sure she submits like the form for all of them. So. 509 01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:46.029 Jenny Duan: I think honestly the most. Oh, basically, after how the Elks works is after this round, like, if you pass this round, there's going to be a semi-finalist round, and then you'll have to write more essays. 510 01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.150 huda: Go ahead! 511 01:02:47.869 --> 01:02:51.820 Jenny Duan: Like this is kind of just the preliminary. If that makes sense. 512 01:02:53.475 --> 01:02:54.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 513 01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.360 Jenny Duan: yeah. 514 01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:06.130 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool.

And then, whenever you're ready, just like you can fill out the elks thing, I think, on your own. Just submit it whenever you're ready, and then come back and be ready to draft to talk about the Amazon essays and the Equitable Excellence essays. 527 01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:05.740 Jenny Duan: And then, Burger King, you can kind of just like submit that whenever on your own, because it's not that serious, just like, whenever you submit. 528 01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.040 huda: Yeah. 529 01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.950 huda: Okay.

Never mind, they have computer science plus advertising. But I feel like, that's that's a lot different than 37 00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.480 Jenny Duan: the journalism film. 38 00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.320 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 39 00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.770 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, never mind. 40 00:06:36.147 --> 00:06:39.560 Jenny Duan: This is, I like v, 2, v, 2 is the one you should go with. 41 00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.036 Jenny Duan: Alright, great! 42 00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.719 Jenny Duan: yeah, I I actually don't really have any comments on this.

It's my obsession. 52 00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:24.359 Jenny Duan: Where did you like? Where did you glimpse the transformative power of personalized education through what I think you have like 5 words left. You can write, maybe, like one example of where you watched it, or like something that you've done that's furthered. It. 53 00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:35.119 huda: Yeah, I think like, I was previously referencing, like synthoria with coding like educational games. So maybe I can just say, like through the game I developed synthoria. 54 00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:39.900 Jenny Duan: Sworn from to an everyday phase 55 00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.529 Jenny Duan: as I developed synthuria. 56 00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.099 Jenny Duan: This is perfect. The last sentence. 57 00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.610 Jenny Duan: thanks. 58 00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:27.960 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 59 00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:46.729 Jenny Duan: okay, what do you think about this? Just added a short mention of synthoria. And then, if they want to learn more about it. They can look at your activity section, but that's not necessary. 60 00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.857 huda: Should I add, like my game here, so that it might be like 61 00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.449 huda: little more clear. 62 00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.850 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's good 63 00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.630 Jenny Duan: room. 64 00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.450 huda: Oh, okay, that's 1 50 words exactly. 65 00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.200 Jenny Duan: Great 66 00:10",
    ":40.040 --> 00:10:42.050 Jenny Duan: wait. I feel like this is a little bit 67 00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.609 Jenny Duan: of repetition from the previous essay. 68 00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Instead of neural networks, you can use a different thing. 69 00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.180 huda: One. 70 00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.870 huda: Maybe, like I don't know, like giving a specific example is like. 71 00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.380 Jenny Duan: This is good, this is good. 72 00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.080 huda: Okay. 73 00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.140 Jenny Duan: Great. This makes a lot of sense. I feel like you really got it. 74 00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:39.670 huda: Cute. 75 00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.379 Jenny Duan: And it's exactly 1 50 words. 76 00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:44.830 Jenny Duan: Honestly, I have no nothing to say about this. 77 00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.339 Jenny Duan: This is really good, short, and sweet. 78 00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.310 huda: Okay. Great. 79 00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.800 Jenny Duan: I like, feel also, like, I feel comfortable approving this. 80 00:11:53.356 --> 00:11:55.389 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is really good. 81 00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.900 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait.

Stanford and Usc, like 2 days, or maybe 83 00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.279 huda: there you go. 84 00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.260 Jenny Duan: Yay 85 00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.010 Jenny Duan: Preschool. Submitted. 86 00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.276 huda: Yeah, and then I'm about to have 4. But 87 00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.360 Jenny Duan: After today. 88 00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:43.429 huda: Yeah, I also set up like the portals and everything. And then and like the turby gave like, an email as well. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention, Unc does like they have like this, like Fafsa pre, like, like the Beta version, so that they send out thi",
    "s form where I can like put like Fsa ids, and see like my eligibility, so hopefully, that'll be coming in like soon. And I can kind of figure out for, like the rest of the schools as well. But yeah. 89 00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 90 00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:57.309 Jenny Duan: okay. Great, amazing. So 91 00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:03.010 Jenny Duan: so proud. Next thing I, this is, these are all your early schools right? Am I missing anything? 92 00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.030 huda: Yes. 93 00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.939 Jenny Duan: No, right. I'm not missing anything. Right? 94 00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:20.939 Jenny Duan: Okay, we can take a breather cause your early round is done, Huda. I'm so happy. Okay, but it's not really a breather, because now I'm about to dump a lot more work on you, unfortunately or fortunately. But 95 00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.000 Jenny Duan: yeah, there's there's more to be done? Can you share your elk stuff with me? 96 00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.210 huda: Yeah. 97 00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:37.360 Jenny Duan: I really, Huda, I think you would be the perfect candidate for this. I really want you to apply for this, but it's not open yet, but when it's open. 98 00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.720 Jenny Duan: keep an eye out. 99 00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.130 huda: Oh, okay. 100 00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.540 huda: own. 101 00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.010 huda: I think it 102 00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.390 huda: open. 103 00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.120 huda: And October 28.th 104 00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:55.580 Jenny Duan: Oh, it is open shoot it is. Oh, my gosh, it's already October 28.th Okay, this is another big priority for you. 105 00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:09.219 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest thing with like with scholarship applications is you need to make sure that your letters of recommend your recommenders can get their stuff in on time. So that's like the most going to be the most critical component, like ensuring that your recommenders get ",
    "their stuff in 106 00:14:10.156 --> 00:14:13.539 Jenny Duan: because I am confident in your writing ability. But 107 00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.230 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's just 108 00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.089 Jenny Duan: it has to be about your 109 00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.209 Jenny Duan: your recommender is getting it in time. 110 00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.980 Jenny Duan: okay. 111 00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:34.409 Jenny Duan: I'm on your elk stocks. This is basically for Elks. You can kind of just use your personal statement like, that's basically what I did for my elks thing. 112 00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:40.620 Jenny Duan: just like, shorten your personal statement, and make it 500 words and fit it to the prompt. A bit. 113 00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.099 huda: Okay, yeah, I think that makes sense. And so the extracurricular that I will be like in focus would be Cynthoria. 114 00:14:47.372 --> 00:14:59.359 Jenny Duan: Can you copy paste your personal statement here? And then we can honestly just fill this in and turn it in today, like it's this is pretty low lift.

So so I just pasted this in in. You have about 330 characters left here. 295 00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.829 Jenny Duan: so you can. Just 296 00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.130 Jenny Duan: do you think you'll be able to elaborate on this a little bit. 297 00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.939 huda: Yeah. Maybe. 298 00:41:49.720 --> 00:42:09.870 Jenny Duan: You can talk about like, you know, in your personal statement you described like the people who came to to empower her hacks. You can talk about like maybe empower her hacks. You can talk like this. One is just like, try to hit all the diversity cards that you can like. You're an immigrant like, maybe you speak a different language at home like you, you interacted with people with all different cultures like you're multicultural 299 00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.490 Jenny Duan: like, just try to yeah. 300 00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.700 Jenny Duan: get diversity points here. 301 00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:33.520 huda: Yeah, do you think like, it's actually, I know, I think it's not really Stem related. But if I were to like mention, like eld to kind of somehow like bring up like that. I'm an immigrant. Would that be worth it? But since I guess, since it's not stem, it might not really help. 302 00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 303 00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.299 huda: Let me see. 304 00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.990 huda: I think 305 00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.175 huda: so. 306 00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:14.669 huda: Oh, wait! How would I bring up, like other like different diversity points through like the empower hacks? Organization. 307 00:43:15.998 --> 00:43:36.029 Jenny Duan: You can talk about like interacting with people from all different cultures. And how like you, ",
    "you founded this organization, you you discovered that like, there's people from like. How many, however, many countries represented, and they all have something to bring, and that taught you about like the importance of diverse values. When pursuing stem, because, like their ideas, help contribute to like you, seeing problems in a different way. 308 00:43:37.026 --> 00:43:56.589 huda: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. And then maybe like, I was thinking, what if I can talk about like someone who is from the Uae cause. I know that I think there was someone from empower hacks was also from the Uae and I can talk about like how I was also born there, and like 309 00:43:56.959 --> 00:44:01.910 huda: how I immigrate like I I could just like somehow, like kind of weave that in. 310 00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.090 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. 311 00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.600 Jenny Duan: that sounds good. 312 00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:14.769 huda: Okay? And then for this last essay, actually, I don't know if there's an additional information for this one. 313 00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:17.260 huda: But 314 00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.589 huda: if there are she? 315 00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.080 huda: Oh, yeah, this is the additional information. So I can just talk about like how 316 00:45:24.434 --> 00:45:30.450 huda: use basically to use the same like additional information that I've been using, and then also mentioned how 317 00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:33.160 huda: like 318 00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.840 huda: I'll mention how like it's like inspired me to like make 319 00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.240 huda: free education available. I guess. 320 00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:49.329 Jenny Duan: let me look at the Amazon. Future engineers like their criteria, 321 00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.926 Jenny Duan: the other thing about this is that's really cool is that this gives you 322 00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:13.199 Jenny Duan: like a guaranteed internship after your freshman year of college at Amazon. 323 00:46:13",
    ".660 --> 00:46:14.530 huda: Wow! 324 00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:22.790 Jenny Duan: So that's like pretty cool. So not only do you get $40,000. You also get a guaranteed internship, a paid internship. 325 00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:24.850 huda: Wow! I hope I get it. 326 00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:26.090 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 327 00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:31.050 Jenny Duan: I hope you get it like, this is the perfect opportunity for you. It really is. 328 00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:32.300 Jenny Duan: So. 329 00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.989 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I really hope that you get it. 330 00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.116 huda: Thank you. 331 00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:51.349 Jenny Duan: It's okay. And so yeah, I think for the additional information, just like, emphasize your like, financial need emphasize rural town like, basically, you just need to hit as many diversity points as you can here and like, just emphasize your background because it's for like 332 00:46:51.860 --> 00:47:01.380 Jenny Duan: is for like underserved students. And so I feel like you are a really good fit for this because of your background, too, like it's it's a really good mutual fit. And so I 333 00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.928 Jenny Duan: like you should. You should. 334 00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:05.930 Jenny Duan: you know. Be good. 335 00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.520 Jenny Duan: Okay. 336 00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.679 huda: yeah, I feel like these. These essays are also like a little intimidating. But. 337 00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.060 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 338 00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:20.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, which leadership principle do you think you want to write about. 339 00:47:22.012 --> 00:47:24.130 huda: Let me take a look. Here. 340 00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:33.419 Jenny Duan: Or you don't have to directly respond to a leadership principle. But, like, what's the problem in your school that could be solved? I think you said lack of Cs teachers? Right? 341 00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.380 huda: Yeah, and also, yeah, like. 342 00",
    ":47:36.450 --> 00:47:45.459 huda: lack of Cs teachers, like, there's like an abundance of people that want to learn. Cs, so there's like curious people. But like they just. 343 00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:53.590 huda: they don't really have like the resources to like kind of learn new things. And so I'd like to build like tools. 344 00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:58.620 huda: so that there's like a whole like lesson plans like like a whole, I guess. 345 00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.560 huda: Syllabus, maybe even about like 346 00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:06.189 huda: like what to learn through gamified learning 347 00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:25.529 huda: and wait. Are these supposed to be answered more straightforward or through like like a story, kind. 348 00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.310 Jenny Duan: I think, mix like, start with the story, and then go straight forward. 349 00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:31.640 huda: Okay. 350 00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:46.519 Jenny Duan: Like. It's not like you. I don't think you have enough, because they're so short, like I think stories are only super effective when you have like a lot of characters to write about it and to bring it out. But like, since you don't have a lot of characters, you don't. 351 00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.619 Jenny Duan: But you can't just write a story because you don't. You just don't have enough space for that. 352 00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.860 huda: Yeah. 353 00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.379 Jenny Duan: Okay, and then describe your career goals and aspirations. This is like pretty straightforward, I think. 354 00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.440 huda: Almost like I've written like a couple. 355 00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, you've written so many of these, like, I think. 356 00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:02.050 huda: Yeah. 357 00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.160 Jenny Duan: You've got this. 358 00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:09.470 huda: Like you use one of them, or like I mean, like, maybe just make it more like stem facing. I guess. 359 00:49:0",
    "9.470 --> 00:49:23.679 Jenny Duan: Yeah, stemify it. Make it? Cs, because this is like for Amazon to hire like they wanna hire software. They're hiring software engineers from this. So focus on gaming. But also, maybe like, write about like problem solving or like other software engineer stuff. Because, like 360 00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:27.129 Jenny Duan: this is in a software engineering internship. So that's like 361 00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.660 Jenny Duan: the type of students that they're interested in, too. 362 00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:36.719 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you feel comfortable with this? Do you have any other questions about this specific one? 363 00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:43.629 Jenny Duan: I feel like there's just gonna be a lot of writing, but I feel like, since you already have a big background with writing essays like 364 00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:56.620 Jenny Duan: with scholarships. It's just kind of like copy pasting things like reworking it, and then like doing the manual copy paste for all the activities. That's what I remember. I remember like the hardest part about doing scholarships is just like all the copy pasting, like everything back and forth. 365 00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:57.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 366 00:49:58.006 --> 00:50:04.359 huda: Yeah, I mean, I don't think I have any questions. I think I'll try and write like, a draft of these essays. 367 00:50:04.984 --> 00:50:09.850 huda: But yeah, I think I think this is a good like framework to move forward. 368 00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:16.590 Jenny Duan: Okay here, there's more when you think there's not more, there's there's more. So. 369 00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:19.550 Jenny Duan: yeah. 370 00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:24.490 Jenny Duan: Burger King. Yay, new one. 371 00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.100 Jenny Duan: So 372 00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:31.328 Jenny Duan: yeah, here's Burger King.

Do you see this? The statement or video will not be used in selecting recipients for any of the awards. 399 00:53",
    ":42.640 --> 00:53:43.440 huda: Oh. 400 00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:44.670 huda: yeah. 401 00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:49.109 Jenny Duan: Wait. So what are they using to to select, to select recipients 402 00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:53.670 Jenny Duan: my concern? Let me look at their FAQ really quickly. 403 00:53:55.890 --> 00:54:01.060 Jenny Duan: Because, like, how are they selecting recipients if they're not reading your essays? Question, Mark. 404 00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.110 Jenny Duan: Hi. 405 00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:05.710 huda: Oh! 406 00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.789 Jenny Duan: Okay. Oh, what? 407 00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.400 huda: So. Not at all. It's not 408 00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.070 huda: really. Oh. 409 00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:14.519 Jenny Duan: What are they awarded for. 410 00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.339 huda: Academic achievements, participation in school and community. 411 00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.639 Jenny Duan: Activity, work, experience. 412 00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.840 Jenny Duan: Well, okay, well, you don't have any work experience. But. 413 00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:27.170 huda: Yeah. 414 00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:40.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, whatever. You have a good extracurriculars. So it's like, it's like, whatever, okay, maybe like, don't spend so much time on this. Then, because this seems like a bit like unserious compared to the other one compared to the other one. 415 00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:41.469 huda: Yeah, like. 416 00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:47.661 Jenny Duan: It's it's like silly and goofy like, just apply. Why not? Okay? I'm not really concerned. You can just write whatever you want for 417 00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.449 Jenny Duan: The personal statement not used at all, apparently. 418 00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.630 huda: I think I could like I could even record video. Maybe. 419 00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:06.870 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like a 2 min video or something like, okay, just write like a like a something random or do like a random record. They're not usi",
    "ng it. So it doesn't really matter. 420 00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:12.159 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is just whatever I don't think we should spend too much time on this. 421 00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:14.169 Jenny Duan: Okay, next one. 422 00:55:15.355 --> 00:55:15.760 huda: Okay. 423 00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.999 Jenny Duan: It's just gonna keep on like going for 424 00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.980 Jenny Duan: the next couple of months. 425 00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:30.240 Jenny Duan: So I think biggest things right now are getting the Elks in getting Amazon future engineers getting equitable. And then after that, after these 3 main ones oh, and 426 00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:36.169 Jenny Duan: the Reagan scholar! But the Reagan Foundation is a little bit later. I think our focus should be like 427 00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:41.760 Jenny Duan: Amazon, because that's $40,000 equitable cause that's $20,000. And 428 00:55:42.393 --> 00:55:49.499 Jenny Duan: what's Elk? Because that's also like $20,000 like those are like big scholarships that you should apply for. Everything else is kind of just like. 429 00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:59.880 Jenny Duan: take it or leave it. It's fine and then, after we finish these 3, we should go back to your Uc essays and also your regular decisions that are coming up. 430 00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:01.959 huda: Yeah, it's so. 431 00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.680 Jenny Duan: Your oh, sorry! Go ahead! 432 00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.760 huda: Wait, which which 3 scholarships do. We need to work on before you cease. 433 00:56:09.412 --> 00:56:15.207 Jenny Duan: Amazon. I'm not, maybe not before, but like alongside Amazon, equitable and 434 00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:22.739 Jenny Duan: and Elks those are the 3 like with the biggest monetary awards associated 435 00:56:24.128 --> 00:56:26.099 Jenny Duan: and then the other thing is. 436 00:56:26.688 --> 00:56:30.040 Jenny Duan: did you get your fee waivers? Waivers? Approved. 437 00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:30.820 huda: Yes. 438 00:56",
    ":31.190 --> 00:56:34.519 Jenny Duan: Okay, that means for regular. You can basically apply to like 439 00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:42.370 Jenny Duan: as many schools as you want, because you have the waivers. So like northeastern. No essays. That's an application like 440 00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:44.070 Jenny Duan: alright. 441 00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:45.170 huda: And actually. 442 00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:50.609 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! You already submitted. But you didn't tell me this. We so now you're at how many schools like 5 schools done. 443 00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:57.659 huda: Yeah, that's northeastern Unc. Sanford, Usc. And Uic. 444 00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:58.780 huda: 5. 445 00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 5 schools. Okay, cool. 446 00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:07.749 Jenny Duan: So you have 5 schools done like, that's awesome. Basically, you can apply to like 2030 schools like as many as the common app supports. Because 447 00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:27.610 Jenny Duan: I don't know. I feel like once you start writing essays like it's gonna be pretty easy to like churn them out so like like you can just like, if you want, you can apply to like all the ivy leagues you can apply to, like all the top 20 schools if you want to like, it just depends because you have the waivers. So it doesn't really like matter that much. So why not just like, go crazy if you want to. 448 00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:35.034 huda: Yeah. The only only thing I'm like I'm worried about is like adding, like my counselor and recommenders like these new schools, because 449 00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.199 Jenny Duan: No, but they write one essay for all your schools. They just send the information over. 450 00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:53.819 huda: I think they have to do it again, though, because I think they submitted it to all the ones that I already have in my list. So I think I'll just have to remind them again. But I think to remind them for the scholarships. So yeah. 451 00:57:54.140 --> 00:58:04.01",
    "9 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's fine, just like, get on good terms like, write. Thank you. Cards. Write Christmas cards, get them like gifts, not expensive gifts, but like, get them some like flowers. Get them some chocolate like they just, you know. 452 00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:04.620 huda: Yeah. 453 00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:09.480 Jenny Duan: Like they're gonna have to help you a lot like that's just how it is going to be. But 454 00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:14.999 Jenny Duan: I think all students in your position are demanding a lot from their campuses right now. 455 00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:21.200 Jenny Duan: but I think that's why. Just like be mindful about giving them a heads up as soon as possible. 456 00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:32.700 Jenny Duan: But if you need, like a letter of recommendation for them to get it in. Okay, cool, equitable excellence. It's a great program like, I'm I got a scholarship from them. They're like, really great. 457 00:58:33.095 --> 00:58:36.180 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 5,000 a year. It's pretty good. 458 00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:36.570 huda: Wow! 459 00:58:36.783 --> 00:58:41.060 Jenny Duan: How many is this? The only essay that you have to write, and how many characters or words is this. 460 00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:46.660 huda: Yes, it's the only one, and there's a thousand characters. Oh, well, there's. 461 00:58:46.660 --> 00:59:02.990 Jenny Duan: So short. Oh, my gosh, that is so short. And then this see, like this, financial circumstances is basically the same exact essay that you'll submit for Amazon that you'll submit, for, like everything else. So you just copy paste. That and 1,000 characters is really short. Can you share this document with me? 462 00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.080 huda: Yes. 463 00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.420 Jenny Duan: And also put the contact id level, like whatever customer support. 464 00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.650 Jenny Duan: Can you put this in the chat. 465 00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:13.190 huda: Yes. 466 00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:14.360",
    " huda: and. 467 00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.609 Jenny Duan: Alright. Thank you so much. 468 00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:26.139 Jenny Duan: okay, 1,000 characters is really short. Okay. 469 00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.990 Jenny Duan: let me see what I wrote for this. I don't even remember. 470 00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:43.350 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think they were different essays. 471 00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:47.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, if you want, you can read my essays. 472 00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.800 Jenny Duan: let me just 473 00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.250 Jenny Duan: and 474 00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:51.770 Jenny Duan: put them in chat. 475 00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.630 Jenny Duan: I don't. But these are different. These are different essays. 476 00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:58.890 Jenny Duan: So 477 00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.230 Jenny Duan: yeah. 478 01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:12.329 huda: Well, I guess that I guess that the 1st one's kind of like they're kind of all. They're both kind of like similar, because. 479 01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:14.660 huda: Questions about like 480 01:00:16.274 --> 01:00:17.490 huda: enhancing. 481 01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.040 huda: It's about like. 482 01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:27.040 huda: how do you plan to pay it forward and inspire others in your community to inspire their own college education? 483 01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:38.000 Jenny Duan: I think, for this one you can talk about like being from Mountain House, California, this like small town, and like how you've created opportunities here. I feel like you've written similar essays. So you can kind of just like like 484 01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.670 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Go hang there. 485 01:00:43.220 --> 01:01:01.350 huda: Should I also mention like or I don't know if I'll have space, but like like Mht jobs, and like that was also one way that I was. Well, I guess that doesn't really like relate to like pursuing like college education. So yeah, I think like empowering. AI might be like a better. 486 01:0",
    "1:01.700 --> 01:01:07.660 Jenny Duan: I, empowering the air and say, like, you will continue to do this with like the tools that you gain from your education experience. 487 01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.289 Jenny Duan: it's only 1,000 characters so like you really don't have very much 488 01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.590 Jenny Duan: room to say that to say too much. 489 01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:17.680 Jenny Duan: No. 490 01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:18.255 huda: Yeah. 491 01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.780 Jenny Duan: Maybe talk about like what you want to study in college and like 492 01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:28.770 Jenny Duan: and like. Why, it's so important to you. Maybe like you're the 1st to to do your degree in the United States right? 493 01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:36.579 Jenny Duan: I can't talk about that, but you can also leave that for the second essay. The second 1,000 words where it asks about your like. Special circumstances, too. 494 01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:37.760 huda: Yeah. 495 01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.094 huda: I'll try and get whatever in the 1,000 characters. But. 496 01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.267 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, cool. I feel like. 497 01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:50.569 Jenny Duan: maybe next time we meet, you can just have rough drafts of these essays. 498 01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.720 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's 499 01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.909 Jenny Duan: is that is that an okay target for the next time we meet. 500 01:01:56.622 --> 01:02:02.109 huda: Okay, so which ones should I prioritize the Amazon ones? Or should I prioritize. 501 01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:04.279 Jenny Duan: Elks cause that has the 1st deadline. 502 01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.120 huda: Okay, yeah, I mean, but we also are. 503 01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:14.860 Jenny Duan: Oh, but we're like already done, I think, for else you can honestly like. Just submit it whenever you want to like. I don't really think that one is 504 01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.320 Jenny Duan: like. It's only one essay, your comme",
    "nts already good. So it's like, I don't know 505 01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.180 Jenny Duan: not. 506 01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:20.720 huda: Yeah. 507 01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:24.860 Jenny Duan: Not that much you can like. Do really, you know. 508 01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:32.209 huda: Yeah, I just need to get my counselor. I just need to make sure she submits like the form for all of them. So. 509 01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:46.029 Jenny Duan: I think honestly the most. Oh, basically, after how the Elks works is after this round, like, if you pass this round, there's going to be a semi-finalist round, and then you'll have to write more essays. 510 01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.150 huda: Go ahead! 511 01:02:47.869 --> 01:02:51.820 Jenny Duan: Like this is kind of just the preliminary. If that makes sense. 512 01:02:53.475 --> 01:02:54.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 513 01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.360 Jenny Duan: yeah. 514 01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:06.130 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool.
