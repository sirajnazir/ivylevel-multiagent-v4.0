No problem. 2 00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.550 huda: Hi. 3 00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.310 Jenny Duan: Hi! How's it going? 4 00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.559 huda: Hi, it's good. How are you? 5 00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm doing well. Let's just get straight into it. How's everything going with school? How's your week going? Any updates? 6 00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:45.789 huda: Yeah. So I'd say, it's definitely got a lot more hectic this week. I had 2 quizzes today, and I was trying to make time for studying extra yesterday. But I think I allocated more time on my extra curriculum yesterday, cause I was working on a game like a lot, and just kinda like planning out 7 00:01:45.790 --> 00:02:01.330 huda: the script for the video that I was gonna make about the Ap hug exam, so I didn't get as much time to study, which I think I could have definitely like prioritize that day, cause I was struggling during the quiz today. 8 00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:14.859 huda: and other than that, there hasn't been much nothing new going on. But yeah, I have like prepared a script for my video, which I hope to film today and then get editing throughout the week 9 00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.590 Jenny Duan: cool. So do we want to make an adjustment to the tracker to put more time on school, or what has been like the hardest 10 00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.020 Jenny Duan: thing for you. 11 00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.470 huda: Yeah. So like, where where we're at right now. It's really hot. And after coming back from school, I think I'm like 12 00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.650 huda: tired. So I think maybe just allocating like 30 min to like a nap or something that would be helpful. 13 00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.290 huda: And also I think I don't need that much time on planning clubs, cause I just 14 00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.619 huda: I haven't been able to do much with that. So 15 00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:08.769 Jenny Duan: okay, so then why don't we just make this like a work club, or you can take a break here, if you need to. This can just be like flexible time. If you need a break. If you need extra time on your homework, because the next section is homework. So if you need to do extra homework stuff, you need to study more. This would be a good time to do that 16 00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.490 Jenny Duan: on this like 5, 15 window 17 00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.120 Jenny Duan: this? 4, 15 to 5, 15 window. Does that does that sound good to you? 18 00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:28.449 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely sounds good. Okay, cool. And then what I want to talk about today is like the status of your video interview project. How is that going? 19 00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.040 huda: I haven't been able to make that much progress. 20 00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:43.260 huda: but I think I'll probably start working on the website design today after well, I guess I should stop working on the video game now. 21 00:03:43.290 --> 00:04:02.600 huda: and transition to working on the website design. So yeah, I think I'll probably start that now. maybe now would be a good time to break it down. And we can talk about, you know, like what exactly what you need on the website and what details you want there. 22 00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.689 Jenny Duan: so okay, let's go to your document. 23 00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.690 Jenny Duan: I think. 24 00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.550 Jenny Duan: okay, let's see. 25 00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.360 Jenny Duan: So today is 0 8 0 8. 26 00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.750 Jenny Duan: And 27 00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.530 Jenny Duan: okay, breaking down the website. 28 00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.610 Jenny Duan: What types of features do you want to build within the next week? Do you think you said you wanted to do the figma right? 29 00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.550 huda: Yeah, so have you started that yet? 30 00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.520 huda: No. 31 00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:45.690 Jenny Duan: okay, no problem. And how are you gonna fit that into your schedule like every single day? How approximately, how long do you think you'll take for that? 32 00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:59.510 huda: I'm thinking. Maybe this week, if I had me like like, we just made that flexible time. I think maybe that would be a good time to be working on the Sigma. Or maybe I could cut down 33 00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.239 huda: maybe like an hour from my video, game development and work on the website. Design. 34 00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.930 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 35 00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.850 Jenny Duan: okay. 36 00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.400 Jenny Duan: shut down time, video game 37 00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.730 Jenny Duan: or 38 00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.710 Jenny Duan: or make time. Otherwise. Okay, great. 39 00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.110 Jenny Duan: And then so 40 00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:37.980 Jenny Duan: with your entire like strategy, right now, I think it would be really helpful is to figure out like what types of summer programs you want to apply for and like our game plan for that. So 41 00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.129 Jenny Duan: as we look towards next summer and also framing this summer, 42 00:05:43.610 --> 00:06:03.680 Jenny Duan: because, again, your software and your junior summers are the most important 2 summers. We need to figure out, one a way to frame what you've spent time doing this summer, and then what you spent time doing, what you're going to be spending time doing next summer? For your application. Does that make sense? Okay, awesome? So this summer. Can you describe to me what you've spent most of your time doing? 43 00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:17.510 huda: Yeah. So I've definitely I've been studying for the sat and working on the video game. I think the game art definitely took a large portion of my time. 44 00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.410 huda: so 45 00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.759 huda: other than that. 46 00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.510 huda: trying to think 47 00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.860 huda: actually, I don't have that many things this summer. but 48 00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.160 huda: let me go back to my list. 49 00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.689 Jenny Duan: okay, no problem. 50 00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.470 huda: So I did sort of Youtube channel and I posted one video. But I don't think that's really 51 00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.690 huda: like solid 52 00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.500 huda: but I did do some like filming for 53 00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:17.890 huda: a family wedding, something new posting that as well. That's really cool. Actually. hmm. 54 00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.760 huda: yeah. So maybe that could get 55 00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.270 huda: some recognition. And 56 00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.820 huda: I built like website designs on Vigna. 57 00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.359 Jenny Duan: Wait what I'm saying. Can you repeat that? 58 00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:44.100 huda: Yeah. So I built like website designs on Sigma, to try and learn ui over the summer. 59 00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.370 huda: I also wear some 60 00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.019 huda: AI all by myself from the Google course. 61 00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.190 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that's that's super awesome. That sounds good, then and then learning 62 00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:09.479 Jenny Duan: self learning. So these are all really great and valuable things. I think this is sounds good for this summer. Okay? And then framing next summer. This is where 63 00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:18.990 Jenny Duan: we need to think ahead about what types of projects you want to continue on. And then what summer programs. You're looking for. So for things that you want to continue next summer, what is 64 00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:26.290 Jenny Duan: have you thought about? What type of project you want to do next summer. Or if you want to continue ideally continuing the project that you're working on now as well. 65 00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:43.679 huda: Yeah. So I wanna publish my video game on steam and other websites. And I definitely wanna continue my Youtube channel and maybe like, try to have, like a really large amount of following by then. 66 00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.809 huda: and I do. Wanna 67 00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.569 huda: maybe I could start freelancing on Fiverr for website design. 68 00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.960 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then 69 00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.510 Jenny Duan: freelance web design and 70 00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.479 Jenny Duan: what was the last 10, Youtube Channel. 71 00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:17.759 Jenny Duan: I have a question like, I remember a while ago, one thing we talked about was running a hackathon. Is this something that you're still interested in or not? It? It's okay. If you're not, I'm just like trying to get a sense of the things that you are thinking about doing. 72 00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:26.409 huda: Yeah, I'm definitely interested in doing the hackathon, but running a hackathon. But I'm not sure how 73 00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:34.809 huda: that would be done as like. I've never organized anything like that, and I don't know if anyone else would want to organize it with me. 74 00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.440 huda: I could probably reach out to friends. But yeah. 75 00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:52.759 Jenny Duan: okay, then, I think maybe we can put like participating in a hackathon. Maybe instead, like, if you wanna compete in a hackathon that could be a good idea. And then, okay, now, I'm populating this 76 00:09:52.990 --> 00:10:00.319 Jenny Duan: with a bunch more things that I wanted to tell you about. So let me just write a couple more things down. 77 00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:07.840 Jenny Duan: so okay, first thing, have you ever heard about coded classy before? 78 00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.620 huda: No, I haven't. 79 00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:22.160 Jenny Duan: Okay. That's that's fine. If you haven't, it's basically a summer program for girls who are interested in computer science. It's a free program. It's like 2 weeks. There's different tracks like web, dev mob, mobile app dev 80 00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:37.449 Jenny Duan: AI data science. And this is a pretty cool program. I've done it twice, and I've been instructing assistant for it now, and it's pretty powerful program. So I'm that's why I put that down. And then journalism camp is that when we talked about Nsli, have you heard about it. 81 00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.589 huda: No, I haven't. 82 00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.529 Jenny Duan: Okay. It's like a language learning. It's like a language learning program for 83 00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.620 Jenny Duan: for students. So 84 00:10:47.670 --> 00:11:01.689 Jenny Duan: you can go to basically the government, the United States Government will fly you out for a different, for a to a different country. And you will like stay there and learn the language for about 6 weeks. So 85 00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:11.950 Jenny Duan: I think that is pretty valuable. Yeah, it. It's pretty cool. And then the other things are 86 00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:22.650 Jenny Duan: the tisp. It's another like it's called Telleride Association Summer Program. It's also very prestigious 87 00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:29.490 Jenny Duan: so this is one that if you get in it's like pretty compelling. Here, let me just show you. 88 00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's 89 00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.759 Jenny Duan: they're like social justice programs. And you like, connect with 90 00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.620 Jenny Duan: other students. This is something that you could think about doing, too. It's again very competitive and 91 00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.570 Jenny Duan: pretty compelling if you get in. And then finally, Notre Dame leadership seminars. Have you heard about this one? 92 00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.920 No, I don't think I have. 93 00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:13.860 Jenny Duan: Okay. So since we want to emphasize your leadership, one specific thing that I found for you is Notre Dame leadership seminars. And it's a free program where you go and you do a project that is supposed to build your leadership and you connect with other students to. It's in person residential at Notre Dame. I've done it before. It's pretty cool. 94 00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:25.440 Jenny Duan: and it's about 3 weeks long. So a lot of these programs are pretty short, so you might be able to do 2 of them. So just putting that on your radar. And then finally, think of America student leaders. Have you heard about this one? 95 00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:31.709 huda: I think I have. I think I've heard of like a scholarship from make of America. But 96 00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:40.380 Jenny Duan: okay, this I don't think it's a scholarship per se, but I think you should apply for this one because it is pretty compelling, like I think. 97 00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.580 Jenny Duan: the Bank of America student leaders. One is one that we should prioritize the application for, because 98 00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.090 Jenny Duan: it's yeah, it's very like. 99 00:12:50.620 --> 00:13:01.210 Jenny Duan: it's very a prestigious to get. And then if you get it. It's an internship for the whole summer, which is something that you can work on remotely or like, not remotely. But you can work on it 100 00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.530 Jenny Duan: in addition to other things. During the summer. So 101 00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.679 Jenny Duan: yeah, those are some things that I've identified. And then 102 00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:17.710 Jenny Duan: we can start working that on that when applications open usually in around around 103 00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:30.290 Jenny Duan: Septemberish. and then other things that I wanna just put on your radar is Some scholarships that you actually have to apply for the year beforehand. 104 00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.400 Jenny Duan: So 105 00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:39.870 Jenny Duan: one of them, actually, I'm gonna put it in the award section for now. And I'll fill this in like with the details. But I'm just giving you the titles right now. 106 00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.480 Jenny Duan: One of them that you should probably 107 00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.730 Jenny Duan: look into. Oh, it's called the bride, Cameron impact foundation 108 00:13:46.850 --> 00:14:12.120 Jenny Duan: scholarship. And again, I want to emphasize that like scholarships are not just scholarships like they're awards, which is why we're applying for them is to give you like more prestigious awards on your application. So one of them is like the Brian Cameron Impact Foundation scholarship, and this one is, if you win it, you get 4 years free tuition at like any college in the Us. And it's a very, very prestigious program. 109 00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:23.930 Jenny Duan: I think this is the only select, like 20 students from across the United States every single year for it. So this is something I'm going to put on. Your rate of the application's open in May of next year, so we'll talk about it in May. 110 00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.169 Jenny Duan: and then another 111 00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:32.359 Jenny Duan: scholarship that I want to put on your radar that we also have to apply for in your in your 112 00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.969 Jenny Duan: sophomore year, or sorry in your junior year of college, is called the Coolidge Scholarship. 113 00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:54.700 Jenny Duan: And again, if you if you win this one it's 4 years free tuition room and board. So basically, your entire college education is free. But again, it's a very prestigious program you apply for in your junior year of school, and if you win it 114 00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.250 Jenny Duan: it's just very compelling. So let me just check the timeline for this. 115 00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:06.970 Jenny Duan: and actually, yeah, I think this is something that we should look at right now. 116 00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.410 Jenny Duan: We can spend some time talking about this. 117 00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:33.750 Jenny Duan: If in case there's nothing else that you want to talk about today, I think this is something that we can highlight. But the application is actually open. So I think, also another strategy. And why we're doing these applications early on, especially just in your junior year, because every single one of these applications for awards for some of our programs is an opportunity to practice your essay writing skills, how to format your extracurriculars and stuff which is useful for your college application 118 00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:51.959 Jenny Duan: later. So think about every one of these applications as a Mini college application. So an opportunity for you to practice your storytelling skills, organizing your extracurriculars and things like that. So I think it'd be a good idea to take a look at this. But is there anything else that you wanted to highlight today, I want to make sure we get those look touched on first. 119 00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:58.549 huda: No, I think we could talk more about these awards. For now. 120 00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:10.919 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. And I just wanna again before we move on, I wanna check that you're set to for all these goals that we talked about over the weekend, you're set for the check in next week. I mean this weekend 121 00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.890 Jenny Duan: okay, and do you need any support from me 122 00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.380 Jenny Duan: for anything on this list? 123 00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.369 huda: I think I'm fine. 124 00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:40.400 huda: yeah. As for the meeting with Counselor they're really busy like this week, and next week, because of schedule changes and all that. And also what should I like? Ask them for a meeting, for, like 125 00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:50.259 huda: just to talk or discuss things? Do you have your counselors email? Because maybe right now, we can draft an email together for your counsel. Yeah. 126 00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.400 Jenny Duan: okay, let's just do that. 127 00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.829 Jenny Duan: So it doesn't have to be next week just whenever they're available. So 128 00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.399 Jenny Duan: let's draft the email together. So 129 00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.169 Jenny Duan: email to counselor. And you could just send this like even during our session today. 130 00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.060 Jenny Duan: So, dear, what's your counselor's name? 131 00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.520 huda: Miss Alexandria. 132 00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.440 Jenny Duan: Okay, dear Miss Alexandria. 133 00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.160 Jenny Duan: does she know who you are? 134 00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.770 huda: Not that?

I'm Mountain House High School. 141 00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:56.800 Jenny Duan: let's say is there one counselor? Is there? What? Like a counselor per last name or set of last names? 142 00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:06.959 huda: Yeah, there's this counsel, for like a set of last names, so mine's like, Sr to something. Yeah. So, miss, she's 143 00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:15.740 Jenny Duan: my counselor. Yeah. And I'm one of your students can just say that. And then personal details 144 00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.890 Jenny Duan: ask and then include 145 00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.590 Jenny Duan: sincerely. So personal details say, like. 146 00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.810 Jenny Duan: I'm 147 00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.710 Jenny Duan: hey this year, or you can say, like 148 00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.160 Jenny Duan: I'm 149 00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.110 Jenny Duan: apps. Do do people say? Mhs, do they say 150 00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.459 Jenny Duan: at mh, S. I'm involved in. 151 00:18:39.560 --> 00:19:01.989 Jenny Duan: and you could fill this out yourself? It'll probably look something like, you know, Broadcast Club, like Vfx Club, broadcast, etc. I'm involved in blank, and I'm interested in blank and for the blanks for your what you're interested in. You can say, like I'm interested in, you know, film, I'm interested in computer science, etc., etc., etc. And then for ask 152 00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:11.970 Jenny Duan: I'd love to set up a brief meeting with you sometime, you know, in the next few weeks. 153 00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:20.760 Jenny Duan: few weeks to check in and discuss my junior year 154 00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:49.620 Jenny Duan: you can say courses, schedules. It doesn't really matter. What you put in. The point is, you want to go there. You want to meet her and you wanna start building a relationship with her? This is really important, because she might be one of the point people for you to put as a reference on your applications, etc., that you'll need later on, and it's generally just good to know your counselor, because, since they know, since they've had so much experience working at your school. They will be familiar with the types of resources and opportunities offered at your school. 155 00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:55.260 Jenny Duan: which is why it's important just for you to build this relationship with her. to do so. 156 00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:04.159 Jenny Duan: to finish this, to discuss your junior year. We can say, like strategy classes planning whatever you want. and then you can say Thank you 157 00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.610 Jenny Duan: so much. 158 00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.159 Jenny Duan: and I look forward to hearing from you, or like something like that. 159 00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.150 Jenny Duan: And then, since you only hear that 160 00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.370 huda: so 161 00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:25.330 Jenny Duan: right now or later, whatever it's most convenient for. You actually, probably right after the session is going to be the best time I want you to just send this email to your counselor. 162 00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320 huda: Yeah, yeah. 163 00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:33.059 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then just fill in the blanks with a couple of things that you're involved in 164 00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:41.909 Jenny Duan: and then, hopefully, you'll be able to set up. You'll be able to get on her calendar within the next like couple of weeks or so. Yeah, okay. 165 00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:50.780 Jenny Duan: so now let's take a look at the first award that we're going to apply for together, which is the Coolidge Scholarship. Again. 166 00:20:51.090 --> 00:21:00.760 Jenny Duan: the point of applying for these is a couple of things. It's not just for a scholarship. It's an opportunity to a practice. Your application strategy, like practicing using 167 00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:26.399 Jenny Duan: the practicing, showcasing your extra curricular. Is your story. Telling things like that second goal win a prestigious award. Third goal is to get real time feedback on your application, because all of these scholarships are telling you the strength of your application at a certain point, like, if you're applying for, like about 10 of these scholarships or programs, the feedback that you get about. Whether or not you advance. Whether or not you get an interview. Whether or not you get rejected is good feedback for telling you like. 168 00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:32.089 Jenny Duan: what types of things have, what to expect for your college application, because every single one of these 169 00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:53.369 Jenny Duan: is kind of like you can treat it as a benchmark for your college application, because if you reach success with these extracurriculars, if you reach success with these awards and scholarships, you'll likely you'll likely to reach success for your college application as well, and if not, then it'll give us feedback on how we can further refine your profile to achieve that level of success. Does that make sense to you? 170 00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.250 huda: Yeah. 171 00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.360 Jenny Duan: amazing. So 172 00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.490 Jenny Duan: maybe we can navigate to this website together. 173 00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:07.640 Jenny Duan: I'll put it in the sheets, but you can also just open it on your own. If you just search up like college scholarship. 174 00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:09.990 huda: Yeah, yeah. 175 00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:11.810 Jenny Duan: cool. 176 00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.240 Jenny Duan: And then. 177 00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.180 Jenny Duan: so this is a really good 178 00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.949 Jenny Duan: like thing that you can read because 179 00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:28.450 Jenny Duan: the the selection, timeline, if you can navigate to that page because it tells you like what kind of things you should expect. So high school juniors so 180 00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:36.440 Jenny Duan: enrolling in college for the first time in fall 2024. That's you. Application. Deadline is February 2320 20. 181 00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.720 Jenny Duan: Oh, shoot! I don't think this is updated. 182 00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.110 huda: Yeah, you should say 183 00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:50.090 Jenny Duan: it should say 2023 to 2024. Let me see. 184 00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.470 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 185 00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.410 Jenny Duan: Cause. I think that the timeline should be open for 186 00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:18.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, never mind. Maybe it is not. Maybe it is not open, but application is open, though, cause. If you go on the application page, it's like accepting. 187 00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.300 huda: and Pope. 188 00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.280 Jenny Duan: Alright perfect. 189 00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:33.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, that's what I was thinking. because it should be open by now. Okay, so why don't we create your account for this? 190 00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:49.859 Jenny Duan: And I think after you create your account, this will be a time for you to share your screen, so we can look at the questions together, because obviously I don't have an account. I'm not applying for this, but so I won't have access to the questions. But if you could share your screen after you've created the account, that would be amazing. 191 00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.730 Jenny Duan: and then this will also give you a sense of what types of questions college applications will ask you to. 192 00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:56.850 huda: Yeah. 193 00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.029 huda: okay, there's like a lot of questions to sign up. So 194 00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.690 Jenny Duan: what kinds of questions. Is it asking you right now? 195 00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.280 huda: It's just like general, like background information like from 196 00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.149 huda: like my address and my phone number. And such 197 00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.320 Jenny Duan: great. 198 00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.270 Ivy Mentors: This is so amazing. 199 00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.080 Ivy Mentors: thanks a lot, Jenny. 200 00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:17.220 Ivy Mentors: I mean, just like the level of tactics and details and hand holding. You know, I think that that kind of a key? It's it's such a key difference. Would you agree? Houda? 201 00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.490 huda: Yeah, for sure. I'm really happy as a dad 202 00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.520 Ivy Mentors: and thank you so much. 203 00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.090 huda: both asking me for my counsellor's name. 204 00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:50.479 Jenny Duan: See this. This is exactly why we need to build a relationship with your counselor, because every application they might ask you about this 205 00:25:50.810 --> 00:26:08.699 Jenny Duan: like II guess now we can see kind of all the pieces coming together. Why, we're prioritizing that relationship is because they really do ask you which is something that you know most people don't know. But now that you know we are highlighting that it's something that you can be prepared for to have that extra le edge over other people, too. 206 00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:30.359 Jenny Duan: It's asking for her phone number. But I don't have her phone number. But this, okay. 207 00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:43.029 Jenny Duan: put the schools. Usually on the school website, you can find like their business phone number. So if you search up. You know her first name and last name, Mount House, High School. You'll probably be able to find it on this. The schools like Staff Page. 208 00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:47.610 Jenny Duan: and if not, then you can just put the school's phone number. It's okay. If you don't have her phone number. 209 00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.710 huda: Okay. 210 00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.450 huda: okay, 211 00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.190 Jenny Duan: amazing cool. 212 00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.200 huda: are they? So 213 00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.660 huda: it's due on February twenty-third. 214 00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.370 Jenny Duan: Perfect. 215 00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.550 huda: Oh. 216 00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.550 Jenny Duan: oh. 217 00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:29.109 Jenny Duan: oh, okay, it's okay. We can still look at the questions. 218 00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:36.849 Jenny Duan: It'll probably pretty similar. Okay, that's so interesting that they haven't opened the application. 219 00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:49.480 Jenny Duan: I mean that they haven't updated their website. Okay, let's look at. Let's look at what they're asking for, though. So we can be prepared. So if you scroll down, let's see letters of reference. Okay, let's leave what they're asking for for letters of reference. 220 00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.489 Jenny Duan: because it'll probably be similar this year. So if you just open that 221 00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:59.789 Jenny Duan: 2 letters. Okay. so this is exactly what college applications look for, too 222 00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:08.409 Jenny Duan: like pretty similar one that can speak to your academic abilities and achievements, and the other who can speak to your character and accomplishments beyond the classroom. 223 00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:17.010 Jenny Duan: So just off the top of the off off the top of your head. Are there 2 teachers or 2 people that you have in mind for these 2 224 00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:25.939 huda: criteria? Yeah. So my, I feel like, maybe my computer science teacher will be able to vouch for. 225 00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:33.410 huda: We're actually my English teacher probably knows me better academically. And my 226 00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.049 huda: can you ask someone that doesn't teach at your school anymore. 227 00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.119 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's fine. It can be anyone. It can be anyone. It can be also like, if you do 228 00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:51.990 Jenny Duan: like a lot of people. They, if they have like mentors outside, they ask them for that. If they would like, volunteered a nonprofit, they asked. Their supervisor doesn't have to be a teacher. 229 00:28:53.130 --> 00:29:03.900 huda: Yeah. So I might ask, my former media art teacher cause she knows me like really personally rather than my other teachers. So yeah. 230 00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.190 Jenny Duan: amazing. 231 00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:12.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, so just thinking ahead, okay, you've identified 2 people. Let's look at the next section 232 00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.820 Jenny Duan: after letters of recommendation. What do they 233 00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.759 Jenny Duan: ask and press close, and then go to the next. Yeah. 234 00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:30.970 Jenny Duan: And then let's see, academic information is that, did you already? 235 00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.549 huda: Oh, you can't click. 236 00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.030 Jenny Duan: darn it. Okay, it would have been cool to see the essays that they would have asked you for that. 237 00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:48.170 Jenny Duan: But okay. let's see. since that's not open. let me see what other ones are open, I think. Actually, Ncw, it 238 00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.130 Jenny Duan: is might be open. 239 00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.539 Jenny Duan: So let me just check that cause. I got 240 00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.580 Jenny Duan: a social media post about that. 241 00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.800 Jenny Duan: So 242 00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.350 Jenny Duan: give me 1 s 243 00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.380 Eastern 244 00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.710 Ivy Mentors: Tusa. Now you know why it's important to invite your teachers to birthdays. 245 00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:33.320 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. I mean, they they all pull my leg, Jenny. I used to invite my teachers to my birthday when I was growing up, but you know I was a very previous student. So finally, I I'm glad that someone understand the important relationship. 246 00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:38.899 Jenny Duan: right? Because they they they do ask you, Huda, like they ask you for things like that which is pretty. 247 00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:48.259 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's it's pretty. It's pretty shocking, because most people don't know that. But you know, you can see how much of a difference it actually makes. 248 00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.470 Jenny Duan: So 249 00:30:50.080 --> 00:31:01.919 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, I think, Ncwit, you can sign up to make an application. But I don't think the applications are open yet. But actually, that's fine, because I have my previous 250 00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:18.470 Jenny Duan: I think they ask the same questions every single year, and I have the access to the question because I applied for it. So it's fine. Let me just give these 2, and this is good that we can do this ahead that way, like when the application opens, you can just submit it, forget it and move on to the next thing you know, like, it's 251 00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.909 Jenny Duan: it, it's okay. If we do it a little bit early. In fact, that's actually better. 252 00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:28.080 Jenny Duan: Okay. So if you scroll down on the document 253 00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:38.209 Jenny Duan: you'll see that I'm putting the questions in. Please explain what sparked your interest in computing and technology. 254 00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.140 Jenny Duan: Tell us what you've been doing with technology. Give us specific details. And 255 00:31:46.550 --> 00:32:00.630 Jenny Duan: let's see. this is an optional question, and then is described. So you can already see that for every single one of these applications there's a ton of essays that you have to write. It's not as simple as like. 256 00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:09.710 Jenny Duan: you just submit something, and then, like. forget about it. You actually have to put pretty specific and specialized 257 00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.919 Jenny Duan: responses to all of these. 258 00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.860 huda: So are these prompts more like 259 00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:24.809 huda: you know how in college apps. You can have to tell like a metaphor, or is it more like straight to the point? 260 00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:39.909 Jenny Duan: No, it's always story telling, storytelling, storytelling, storytelling. That's the most important thing you can do. It doesn't necessarily have to be a metaphor. I mean, you can just tell it straight. But the point is, you need to tell it in a way that is different and stands out. 261 00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.900 Jenny Duan: So. okay. 262 00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:51.200 Jenny Duan: yeah, these are the questions that they had last year. They keep the same questions every single year, like, I've done this a couple of times, and it's always the same question so 263 00:32:51.780 --> 00:33:20.899 Jenny Duan: pretty helpful to know ahead of time. And 4 or 500 word essays. That's like kind of a lot. So this is why it's good that we're starting early, because it's kind of a lot to write just for one essay. But the good thing is, once you have this narrative down, like once you have your story down, which is what we're trying to nail. You can easily apply this to other frameworks and other essays as well, like every anytime, you need to do an application, you can kind of adapt the essays that you already have does that make sense 264 00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.250 huda: yeah. 265 00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.650 Jenny Duan: amazing. So I think maybe today, we can just take this time, to brainstorm 266 00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.539 Jenny Duan: and that way, next week, we can like start getting drafts down for these essays. 267 00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.569 huda: Yeah, so 268 00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:53.690 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then, just to clarify like, this, application opens on September first. So it would be really great. Actually, if we could have this entire application done by September first. That way, we can just do the check in and submit it within that first week of September, so you can get it in pretty early. I think that would be good for you. What do you think? 269 00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.400 huda: Yeah, that's good. 270 00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:04.180 Jenny Duan: amazing. So just looking at this first question, Do you have any initial thoughts on like what sparked your interest? 271 00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.580 huda: Well, when I was younger I had this 272 00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:22.479 huda: robot, though I think it's called the Gmo Robot, and my dad bought it for me from like the Apple store, and I just thought was like the coolest thing ever just like 273 00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:29.000 huda: having it like you could control, like how it walks. You got to build it. And 274 00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:41.880 huda: it was actually using like and I thought it was just like, really cool, and I think Pacific inspired me. To like pursue it when it got older. 275 00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.790 huda: yeah. 276 00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.600 huda: Trying to think of something that isn't as like 277 00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.719 huda: cliche. 278 00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.170 huda: So 279 00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.550 huda: also, one thing is, I live in like the Bay Area, and 280 00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:11.259 huda: like, it's just you get to see like so many like founders and important people in terms of like computing and things. 281 00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:17.340 huda: and it really like sparked interest me. As a young person. 282 00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.000 huda: and 283 00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.729 huda: it definitely. 284 00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:30.720 huda: Oh, and since then I've been like trying to invent things just like them cause. When I was younger I like 285 00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:33.570 huda: I'd be amazed by them, but I've never really like 286 00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.400 huda: done anything but what I think one of part of the prompt is that 287 00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.030 huda: on is that 288 00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:47.709 huda: it, the interest furthered. And my experience of computing and technology. So 289 00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.590 huda: yeah, I definitely wanna create something. 290 00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.720 huda: Since I was young. 291 00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.679 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then this is actually well. 292 00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:08.260 Jenny Duan: like a strategy that I want to share with you. And I think we can really work on refining. And I think this is actually where many people in the Bay area actually get it wrong is like 293 00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:19.909 Jenny Duan: not emphasizing your cultural background or your background. General, because with these types of awards, this is award for women in computer science, they're really emphasizing. Now, let's just look at the website. So you can see for yourself. 294 00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:26.870 Jenny Duan: They wanna emphasize your background. And they wanna emphasize like where you come from. So 295 00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.769 Jenny Duan: let's see aspirations in computing. 296 00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.530 Jenny Duan: computing award. 297 00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.440 Jenny Duan: okay. 298 00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:55.699 Jenny Duan: and encourages them to pursue their passions. Award recipients are selected, based on their aptitude and aspirations in technology and computing as well as as demonstrated by their computing experience, computing related activities, leadership, experience, tenacity in the face of barriers to access and future plans. So 299 00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.710 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure like how to better say this, but 300 00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:24.579 Jenny Duan: I think, with any type of application, it's really really important to emphasize, like, how much you struggle to get to where you are like, even if you don't necessarily struggle that much. It's that's something that like they want to hear, and they want to hear how you've overcome like a certain challenge or background. And for you, that might be like not enough representation, not enough access being a woman in stem, etc., and really emphasizing that, does that make sense? Or does that like 301 00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.720 huda: confuse you? 302 00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.809 huda: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. I would say. One thing that definitely inspired me throughout is also like seeing, like all these 303 00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:56.649 huda: like male engineers and technology like heads, and then all just like I've never seen a woman ever being like a CEO were computer sense, major, for that fact. Growing up. And I think I just wanted to do it regardless that if I was a girl 304 00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.350 huda: and 305 00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:05.689 huda: also, just like the fact that in all these Cs classes that I'm taking 306 00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:14.130 huda: there's like, barely like a handful of girls in the classes. And it just feels like they always talk over us. And 307 00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.770 huda: I just feel like 308 00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.360 huda: I want to further my passion to show that I can 309 00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.940 huda: accomplish the same that they can. 310 00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:34.290 Ivy Mentors: if I may take a minute. Sorry to interrupt here, but I think it's and sorry I didn't mean to interrupt. But I think the last point that Jenny Huda mentioned right, and as as a dad 311 00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.280 Ivy Mentors: I can tell you that Houda's main struggle. 312 00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.890 Ivy Mentors: anxiety. 313 00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:46.080 Ivy Mentors: you know, it's really been very hyper local in her school. 314 00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:56.379 Jenny Duan: right? I think. And I think this is where I told that to be really to show your vulnerability and share, because you know Jenny is your mentor. She's your guide here right? I think you should open up 315 00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:04.390 Ivy Mentors: and her mental struggles. And because I live with her I'm her dad. I can kind of see how she struggles in. 316 00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.030 Ivy Mentors: you know, like for her like it's like the whole system is rigged. 317 00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:35.859 Ivy Mentors: you know. Ii just you know, like she couldn't. She's one of the best programmers, apparently, you know, in the school, but she could not get that leadership role. I think these are the things that kill her right. And she went to this whole. You know, Hackathon in Santa Cruz anytime she goes. She's not able to really gather students around her. She she's really left out, because also, she's new to the school. So I think 318 00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:57.470 Ivy Mentors: I feel like, really, genuinely and authentically, I think everything else. Okay. My view that you're right on that. But I feel like that thing is is really very, very authentic and genuine with Huda and I as a parent, really struggle every day like I'm like. Tell me, what do I do? Do I need? Do I need to go and talk to his dad like, you know that kind of stuff right? Like, so yeah, so. 319 00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:08.510 Jenny Duan: And we reason I'm saying this is because admissions officers, they want to see your. They want to see a story. And that's why it's 320 00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:31.640 Jenny Duan: It's really important to like. Be able to tell your story. From like an authentic perspective, whether or not, that's, you know, moving to a new school. Whether or not that's not seeing representation. All these are really important. And they want to see that story. So actually like, I can read a part of my application to you and you can hear like how I tell my story, and you'll see what I mean by like 321 00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:58.450 Jenny Duan: when I say for one tell a story, and this is like pretty personal to me, too, but I can read it out loud to you, or I can just show you actually. So this is like what I wrote. This, this application for this question, this got me like a national award. But do you see what I mean by you really need to emphasize your background, and they want to hear you tell that story like, I have a pretty typical background, like my parents came to us to pursue education, graduate school education and computer science. 322 00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:09.060 Jenny Duan: And a lot of people have that similar background, like, you know, Asian parents coming to do school to to wherever to work. But this is the way I tell my story, and I think it's compelling, because 323 00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.549 Jenny Duan: you wanna have the reader feel like you. 324 00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:37.599 Jenny Duan: They want to feel your story like you don't need to tell it to them. You want them to feel it, and when you read my story like, for example, this is why I'm saying I love how anyone with an idea can pursue coding. This is why I think it's imperative to make coding and computer science opportunities accessible and promoted to people from all backgrounds. And like, I'm the I'm talking about. I'm the only girl to come to the meetings. It inspires me to share my love for technology. I say, coding is collaborative. 325 00:41:37.880 --> 00:42:05.570 Jenny Duan: and then, in the beginning, you know, I'm talking about my story how my dad came here with nothing but $200 to pursue graduate degree at in computer engineering, talking about my background like how I started to learn how to code and how I, you know, became interested in that, and really, really trying to sell my story that way, making it very, very personal because you wanna have a story that stands out and you want them to feel your story. Lots people might have the same background as you like lots of people move schools. Lots of people, you know. 326 00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:13.869 Jenny Duan: do all these different things. But how do you tell it? In a way that's unique. And how do you tell that in a way that makes them feel like they know you on a personal level? 327 00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.549 huda: Do you understand what I mean by that? Yeah, for sure. 328 00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:36.129 Jenny Duan: So that's what I'm really trying to get at with your story like, how do you tell it? In a way that's unique to you? And how do you really sell? What's unique about you? And what's unique about you is, you know, you've moved a ton. You're from the Bay area. You're Muslim. I don't think we should discount that again. I think you really need to 329 00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:53.159 Jenny Duan: at least emphasize that in some way, because that's a very underre under represented group in technology, especially because there's not a lot of women, Ceos. There's even less women, Muslim, Ceos. And that's very important to see like that's who you are. That's something you should emphasize. I think. 330 00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.810 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? Yeah. 331 00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.030 huda: definitely. 332 00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.550 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think we can pause this brainstorming session here. But I think this is 333 00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:22.289 Jenny Duan: a good start for us to think about. You know, how do we strategize your story? Not just for applications like this. But this is. This is a useful thinking exercise, for you know your other applications as well as your college applications as well, because, again, at the heart of everything. Is your story like, how do you bring out who you are in a unique way? That 334 00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:35.179 Jenny Duan: yeah, what makes you special? And how do you tell your story to stand out from other people. Because again, there's a million Bay area students. There's a million Bay area Cs students. But what makes you different? And how do you share that with other people? 335 00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:39.289 Jenny Duan: Okay? And we can put a pause there. But do you have any questions? 336 00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.920 huda: Yeah, so 337 00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:47.119 huda: would it really like, okay. So one thing I wanted to convey is 338 00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:52.699 huda: in my school. There's there are girls in Cs, but 339 00:43:53.060 --> 00:44:20.560 huda: they just like really are really unmotivated and where guys will like create clubs and try to give each other officer roles the girls. Honestly, just don't really do anything which is kind of like a struggle I faced with like, I know II don't have to stick with only girls, but it's definitely harder to like collaborate with other girls, and empower them when they honestly don't even care about 340 00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:29.899 huda: cool. So I kind of wanted to do that in my essay definitely. That's definitely something you can incorporate. 341 00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:36.730 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. And I think, that's a good point. And I'm glad that you brought up your story as well, that shows right. Because 342 00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:58.000 Ivy Mentors: II think one thing I've also started with is saying like, Please bring out this vulnerability like there's nothing to be ashamed. In fact, that's your super power. Because when I look at like Bay Area founders and like, that's all like, you know, very cliche, as you rightly said without yourself. But that, and also it's very generally the thing. And I was talking about this hackathon. 343 00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:21.070 Ivy Mentors: That's precisely the struggle that faced that. She took the initiative. People just like jumped on her web wagon didn't go. They didn't help her. She was literally the only person there, right? So in some ways. That's a barrier for her as well, because she's not getting she's not able to rally around and bring people who can really support her. And I think the the 344 00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.250 Ivy Mentors: girls thing being one 345 00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:49.580 Ivy Mentors: in a very guys dominate kind of school and and clubs, but also like not having enough kind of thing, and I think this is where I feel like the struggles are, and I don't know. And and and you said right like might be. That's where her struggle and she still for our passion, can form something online. And I don't know, like, I'm just like throwing some ideas here. So that's that's a great great guidance. Here, Jen. 346 00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.559 Jenny Duan: cool. Yeah. So I think 347 00:45:52.690 --> 00:46:09.530 Jenny Duan: we can put a pause in this. Come back to this strategy next week. But I just wanna make sure that you're set to do all the things that we talked about in our list. So sending the email out, and then everything else. Do you need any other support for me right now? Before you start all these activities? 348 00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.599 huda: Oh, no, that sounds good. 349 00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. Then. In that case I will see you over the weekend. 350 00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.219 huda: Thank you very much.",

    "Week 58 - Coaching_Jenny_Huda_Wk58_2023-06-26_M_0f53dda2ddac18b2U_U_00-00-00 WEBVTT 1 00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.740 Jenny Duan: Hey, Jenny? Yeah, she's joining perfect. No problem. 2 00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.550 huda: Hi. 3 00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.310 Jenny Duan: Hi! How's it going? 4 00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.559 huda: Hi, it's good. How are you? 5 00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm doing well. Let's just get straight into it. How's everything going with school? How's your week going? Any updates? 6 00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:45.789 huda: Yeah. So I'd say, it's definitely got a lot more hectic this week. I had 2 quizzes today, and I was trying to make time for studying extra yesterday. But I think I allocated more time on my extra curriculum yesterday, cause I was working on a game like a lot, and just kinda like planning out 7 00:01:45.790 --> 00:02:01.330 huda: the script for the video that I was gonna make about the Ap hug exam, so I didn't get as much time to study, which I think I could have definitely like prioritize that day, cause I was struggling during the quiz today. 8 00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:14.859 huda: and other than that, there hasn't been much nothing new going on. But yeah, I have like prepared a script for my video, which I hope to film today and then get editing throughout the week 9 00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.590 Jenny Duan: cool. So do we want to make an adjustment to the tracker to put more time on school, or what has been like the hardest 10 00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.020 Jenny Duan: thing for you. 11 00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.470 huda: Yeah. So like, where where we're at right now. It's really hot. And after coming back from school, I think I'm like 12 00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.650 huda: tired. So I think maybe just allocating like 30 min to like a nap or something that would be helpful. 13 00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.290 huda: And also I think I don't need that much time on planning clubs, cause I just 14 00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:4",
    "9.619 huda: I haven't been able to do much with that. So 15 00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:08.769 Jenny Duan: okay, so then why don't we just make this like a work club, or you can take a break here, if you need to. This can just be like flexible time. If you need a break. If you need extra time on your homework, because the next section is homework. So if you need to do extra homework stuff, you need to study more. This would be a good time to do that 16 00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.490 Jenny Duan: on this like 5, 15 window 17 00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.120 Jenny Duan: this? 4, 15 to 5, 15 window. Does that does that sound good to you? 18 00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:28.449 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely sounds good. Okay, cool. And then what I want to talk about today is like the status of your video interview project. How is that going? 19 00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.040 huda: I haven't been able to make that much progress. 20 00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:43.260 huda: but I think I'll probably start working on the website design today after well, I guess I should stop working on the video game now. 21 00:03:43.290 --> 00:04:02.600 huda: and transition to working on the website design. So yeah, I think I'll probably start that now. maybe now would be a good time to break it down. And we can talk about, you know, like what exactly what you need on the website and what details you want there. 22 00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.689 Jenny Duan: so okay, let's go to your document. 23 00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.690 Jenny Duan: I think. 24 00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.550 Jenny Duan: okay, let's see. 25 00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.360 Jenny Duan: So today is 0 8 0 8. 26 00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.750 Jenny Duan: And 27 00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.530 Jenny Duan: okay, breaking down the website. 28 00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.610 Jenny Duan: What types of features do you want to build within the next week? Do you think you said you wanted to do the figma right? 29 00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.550 huda: Yeah, so have yo",
    "u started that yet? 30 00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.520 huda: No. 31 00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:45.690 Jenny Duan: okay, no problem. And how are you gonna fit that into your schedule like every single day? How approximately, how long do you think you'll take for that? 32 00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:59.510 huda: I'm thinking. Maybe this week, if I had me like like, we just made that flexible time. I think maybe that would be a good time to be working on the Sigma. Or maybe I could cut down 33 00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.239 huda: maybe like an hour from my video, game development and work on the website. Design. 34 00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.930 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 35 00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.850 Jenny Duan: okay. 36 00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.400 Jenny Duan: shut down time, video game 37 00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.730 Jenny Duan: or 38 00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.710 Jenny Duan: or make time. Otherwise. Okay, great. 39 00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.110 Jenny Duan: And then so 40 00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:37.980 Jenny Duan: with your entire like strategy, right now, I think it would be really helpful is to figure out like what types of summer programs you want to apply for and like our game plan for that. So 41 00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.129 Jenny Duan: as we look towards next summer and also framing this summer, 42 00:05:43.610 --> 00:06:03.680 Jenny Duan: because, again, your software and your junior summers are the most important 2 summers. We need to figure out, one a way to frame what you've spent time doing this summer, and then what you spent time doing, what you're going to be spending time doing next summer? For your application. Does that make sense? Okay, awesome? So this summer. Can you describe to me what you've spent most of your time doing? 43 00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:17.510 huda: Yeah. So I've definitely I've been studying for the sat and working on the video game. I think the game art definitely took a large portion of my time. 44 00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.410 huda: so 45 00:0",
    "6:20.680 --> 00:06:22.759 huda: other than that. 46 00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.510 huda: trying to think 47 00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.860 huda: actually, I don't have that many things this summer. but 48 00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.160 huda: let me go back to my list. 49 00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.689 Jenny Duan: okay, no problem. 50 00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.470 huda: So I did sort of Youtube channel and I posted one video. But I don't think that's really 51 00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.690 huda: like solid 52 00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.500 huda: but I did do some like filming for 53 00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:17.890 huda: a family wedding, something new posting that as well. That's really cool. Actually. hmm. 54 00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.760 huda: yeah. So maybe that could get 55 00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.270 huda: some recognition. And 56 00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.820 huda: I built like website designs on Vigna. 57 00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.359 Jenny Duan: Wait what I'm saying. Can you repeat that? 58 00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:44.100 huda: Yeah. So I built like website designs on Sigma, to try and learn ui over the summer. 59 00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.370 huda: I also wear some 60 00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.019 huda: AI all by myself from the Google course. 61 00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.190 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that's that's super awesome. That sounds good, then and then learning 62 00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:09.479 Jenny Duan: self learning. So these are all really great and valuable things. I think this is sounds good for this summer. Okay? And then framing next summer. This is where 63 00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:18.990 Jenny Duan: we need to think ahead about what types of projects you want to continue on. And then what summer programs. You're looking for. So for things that you want to continue next summer, what is 64 00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:26.290 Jenny Duan: have you thought about? What type of project you want to do next summer. Or if you want to continue ideally continuing the pr",
    "oject that you're working on now as well. 65 00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:43.679 huda: Yeah. So I wanna publish my video game on steam and other websites. And I definitely wanna continue my Youtube channel and maybe like, try to have, like a really large amount of following by then. 66 00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.809 huda: and I do. Wanna 67 00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.569 huda: maybe I could start freelancing on Fiverr for website design. 68 00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.960 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then 69 00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.510 Jenny Duan: freelance web design and 70 00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.479 Jenny Duan: what was the last 10, Youtube Channel. 71 00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:17.759 Jenny Duan: I have a question like, I remember a while ago, one thing we talked about was running a hackathon. Is this something that you're still interested in or not? It? It's okay. If you're not, I'm just like trying to get a sense of the things that you are thinking about doing. 72 00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:26.409 huda: Yeah, I'm definitely interested in doing the hackathon, but running a hackathon. But I'm not sure how 73 00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:34.809 huda: that would be done as like. I've never organized anything like that, and I don't know if anyone else would want to organize it with me. 74 00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.440 huda: I could probably reach out to friends. But yeah. 75 00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:52.759 Jenny Duan: okay, then, I think maybe we can put like participating in a hackathon. Maybe instead, like, if you wanna compete in a hackathon that could be a good idea. And then, okay, now, I'm populating this 76 00:09:52.990 --> 00:10:00.319 Jenny Duan: with a bunch more things that I wanted to tell you about. So let me just write a couple more things down. 77 00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:07.840 Jenny Duan: so okay, first thing, have you ever heard about coded classy before? 78 00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.620 huda: No, I haven't. 79 00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:22.160 Jenny Duan: Okay. That's that's fine.",
    " If you haven't, it's basically a summer program for girls who are interested in computer science. It's a free program. It's like 2 weeks. There's different tracks like web, dev mob, mobile app dev 80 00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:37.449 Jenny Duan: AI data science. And this is a pretty cool program. I've done it twice, and I've been instructing assistant for it now, and it's pretty powerful program. So I'm that's why I put that down. And then journalism camp is that when we talked about Nsli, have you heard about it. 81 00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.589 huda: No, I haven't. 82 00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.529 Jenny Duan: Okay. It's like a language learning. It's like a language learning program for 83 00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.620 Jenny Duan: for students. So 84 00:10:47.670 --> 00:11:01.689 Jenny Duan: you can go to basically the government, the United States Government will fly you out for a different, for a to a different country. And you will like stay there and learn the language for about 6 weeks. So 85 00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:11.950 Jenny Duan: I think that is pretty valuable. Yeah, it. It's pretty cool. And then the other things are 86 00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:22.650 Jenny Duan: the tisp. It's another like it's called Telleride Association Summer Program. It's also very prestigious 87 00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:29.490 Jenny Duan: so this is one that if you get in it's like pretty compelling. Here, let me just show you. 88 00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's 89 00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.759 Jenny Duan: they're like social justice programs. And you like, connect with 90 00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.620 Jenny Duan: other students. This is something that you could think about doing, too. It's again very competitive and 91 00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.570 Jenny Duan: pretty compelling if you get in. And then finally, Notre Dame leadership seminars. Have you heard about this one? 92 00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.920 No, I don't think I have. 93 00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:13.860 Je",
    "nny Duan: Okay. So since we want to emphasize your leadership, one specific thing that I found for you is Notre Dame leadership seminars. And it's a free program where you go and you do a project that is supposed to build your leadership and you connect with other students to. It's in person residential at Notre Dame. I've done it before. It's pretty cool. 94 00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:25.440 Jenny Duan: and it's about 3 weeks long. So a lot of these programs are pretty short, so you might be able to do 2 of them. So just putting that on your radar. And then finally, think of America student leaders. Have you heard about this one? 95 00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:31.709 huda: I think I have. I think I've heard of like a scholarship from make of America. But 96 00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:40.380 Jenny Duan: okay, this I don't think it's a scholarship per se, but I think you should apply for this one because it is pretty compelling, like I think. 97 00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.580 Jenny Duan: the Bank of America student leaders. One is one that we should prioritize the application for, because 98 00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.090 Jenny Duan: it's yeah, it's very like. 99 00:12:50.620 --> 00:13:01.210 Jenny Duan: it's very a prestigious to get. And then if you get it. It's an internship for the whole summer, which is something that you can work on remotely or like, not remotely. But you can work on it 100 00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.530 Jenny Duan: in addition to other things. During the summer. So 101 00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.679 Jenny Duan: yeah, those are some things that I've identified. And then 102 00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:17.710 Jenny Duan: we can start working that on that when applications open usually in around around 103 00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:30.290 Jenny Duan: Septemberish. and then other things that I wanna just put on your radar is Some scholarships that you actually have to apply for the year beforehand. 104 00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.400 Jenny Duan: So 105 00:13:31.870 --> 00:1",
    "3:39.870 Jenny Duan: one of them, actually, I'm gonna put it in the award section for now. And I'll fill this in like with the details. But I'm just giving you the titles right now. 106 00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.480 Jenny Duan: One of them that you should probably 107 00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.730 Jenny Duan: look into. Oh, it's called the bride, Cameron impact foundation 108 00:13:46.850 --> 00:14:12.120 Jenny Duan: scholarship. And again, I want to emphasize that like scholarships are not just scholarships like they're awards, which is why we're applying for them is to give you like more prestigious awards on your application. So one of them is like the Brian Cameron Impact Foundation scholarship, and this one is, if you win it, you get 4 years free tuition at like any college in the Us. And it's a very, very prestigious program. 109 00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:23.930 Jenny Duan: I think this is the only select, like 20 students from across the United States every single year for it. So this is something I'm going to put on. Your rate of the application's open in May of next year, so we'll talk about it in May. 110 00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.169 Jenny Duan: and then another 111 00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:32.359 Jenny Duan: scholarship that I want to put on your radar that we also have to apply for in your in your 112 00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.969 Jenny Duan: sophomore year, or sorry in your junior year of college, is called the Coolidge Scholarship. 113 00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:54.700 Jenny Duan: And again, if you if you win this one it's 4 years free tuition room and board. So basically, your entire college education is free. But again, it's a very prestigious program you apply for in your junior year of school, and if you win it 114 00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.250 Jenny Duan: it's just very compelling. So let me just check the timeline for this. 115 00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:06.970 Jenny Duan: and actually, yeah, I think this is something that we should look at right now. 116 00",
    ":15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.410 Jenny Duan: We can spend some time talking about this. 117 00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:33.750 Jenny Duan: If in case there's nothing else that you want to talk about today, I think this is something that we can highlight. But the application is actually open. So I think, also another strategy. And why we're doing these applications early on, especially just in your junior year, because every single one of these applications for awards for some of our programs is an opportunity to practice your essay writing skills, how to format your extracurriculars and stuff which is useful for your college application 118 00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:51.959 Jenny Duan: later. So think about every one of these applications as a Mini college application. So an opportunity for you to practice your storytelling skills, organizing your extracurriculars and things like that. So I think it'd be a good idea to take a look at this. But is there anything else that you wanted to highlight today, I want to make sure we get those look touched on first. 119 00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:58.549 huda: No, I think we could talk more about these awards. For now. 120 00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:10.919 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. And I just wanna again before we move on, I wanna check that you're set to for all these goals that we talked about over the weekend, you're set for the check in next week. I mean this weekend 121 00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.890 Jenny Duan: okay, and do you need any support from me 122 00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.380 Jenny Duan: for anything on this list? 123 00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.369 huda: I think I'm fine. 124 00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:40.400 huda: yeah. As for the meeting with Counselor they're really busy like this week, and next week, because of schedule changes and all that. And also what should I like? Ask them for a meeting, for, like 125 00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:50.259 huda: just to talk or discuss things? Do you have your counselors email? Because maybe right now, we ",
    "can draft an email together for your counsel. Yeah. 126 00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.400 Jenny Duan: okay, let's just do that. 127 00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.829 Jenny Duan: So it doesn't have to be next week just whenever they're available. So 128 00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.399 Jenny Duan: let's draft the email together. So 129 00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.169 Jenny Duan: email to counselor. And you could just send this like even during our session today. 130 00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.060 Jenny Duan: So, dear, what's your counselor's name? 131 00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.520 huda: Miss Alexandria. 132 00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.440 Jenny Duan: Okay, dear Miss Alexandria. 133 00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.160 Jenny Duan: does she know who you are? 134 00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.770 huda: Not that? Well, like Hello! 135 00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.399 Jenny Duan: So this would be an introduction. So you can say. 136 00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.880 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm gonna leave you to fill this out, because I feel like 137 00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:35.359 Jenny Duan: you can personalize it the way you want, but ideally something like my name is Huda 138 00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.589 Jenny Duan: and I'm a 139 00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.459 Jenny Duan: junior at Mountain House High School, right? 140 00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.609 Jenny Duan: I'm a junior. I'm Mountain House High School. 141 00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:56.800 Jenny Duan: let's say is there one counselor? Is there? What? Like a counselor per last name or set of last names? 142 00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:06.959 huda: Yeah, there's this counsel, for like a set of last names, so mine's like, Sr to something. Yeah. So, miss, she's 143 00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:15.740 Jenny Duan: my counselor. Yeah. And I'm one of your students can just say that. And then personal details 144 00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.890 Jenny Duan: ask and then include 145 00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.590 Jenny Duan: sincerely. So personal details say, like. 146 00:18:25.700 ",
    "--> 00:18:26.810 Jenny Duan: I'm 147 00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.710 Jenny Duan: hey this year, or you can say, like 148 00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.160 Jenny Duan: I'm 149 00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.110 Jenny Duan: apps. Do do people say? Mhs, do they say 150 00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.459 Jenny Duan: at mh, S. I'm involved in. 151 00:18:39.560 --> 00:19:01.989 Jenny Duan: and you could fill this out yourself? It'll probably look something like, you know, Broadcast Club, like Vfx Club, broadcast, etc. I'm involved in blank, and I'm interested in blank and for the blanks for your what you're interested in. You can say, like I'm interested in, you know, film, I'm interested in computer science, etc., etc., etc. And then for ask 152 00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:11.970 Jenny Duan: I'd love to set up a brief meeting with you sometime, you know, in the next few weeks. 153 00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:20.760 Jenny Duan: few weeks to check in and discuss my junior year 154 00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:49.620 Jenny Duan: you can say courses, schedules. It doesn't really matter. What you put in. The point is, you want to go there. You want to meet her and you wanna start building a relationship with her? This is really important, because she might be one of the point people for you to put as a reference on your applications, etc., that you'll need later on, and it's generally just good to know your counselor, because, since they know, since they've had so much experience working at your school. They will be familiar with the types of resources and opportunities offered at your school. 155 00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:55.260 Jenny Duan: which is why it's important just for you to build this relationship with her. to do so. 156 00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:04.159 Jenny Duan: to finish this, to discuss your junior year. We can say, like strategy classes planning whatever you want. and then you can say Thank you 157 00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.610 Jenny Duan: so much. 158 00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.159 Jenny Duan: an",
    "d I look forward to hearing from you, or like something like that. 159 00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.150 Jenny Duan: And then, since you only hear that 160 00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.370 huda: so 161 00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:25.330 Jenny Duan: right now or later, whatever it's most convenient for. You actually, probably right after the session is going to be the best time I want you to just send this email to your counselor. 162 00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320 huda: Yeah, yeah. 163 00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:33.059 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then just fill in the blanks with a couple of things that you're involved in 164 00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:41.909 Jenny Duan: and then, hopefully, you'll be able to set up. You'll be able to get on her calendar within the next like couple of weeks or so. Yeah, okay. 165 00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:50.780 Jenny Duan: so now let's take a look at the first award that we're going to apply for together, which is the Coolidge Scholarship. Again. 166 00:20:51.090 --> 00:21:00.760 Jenny Duan: the point of applying for these is a couple of things. It's not just for a scholarship. It's an opportunity to a practice. Your application strategy, like practicing using 167 00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:26.399 Jenny Duan: the practicing, showcasing your extra curricular. Is your story. Telling things like that second goal win a prestigious award. Third goal is to get real time feedback on your application, because all of these scholarships are telling you the strength of your application at a certain point, like, if you're applying for, like about 10 of these scholarships or programs, the feedback that you get about. Whether or not you advance. Whether or not you get an interview. Whether or not you get rejected is good feedback for telling you like. 168 00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:32.089 Jenny Duan: what types of things have, what to expect for your college application, because every single one of these 169 00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:53.369 Jenny Duan: is kind of like you can treat it ",
    "as a benchmark for your college application, because if you reach success with these extracurriculars, if you reach success with these awards and scholarships, you'll likely you'll likely to reach success for your college application as well, and if not, then it'll give us feedback on how we can further refine your profile to achieve that level of success. Does that make sense to you? 170 00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.250 huda: Yeah. 171 00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.360 Jenny Duan: amazing. So 172 00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.490 Jenny Duan: maybe we can navigate to this website together. 173 00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:07.640 Jenny Duan: I'll put it in the sheets, but you can also just open it on your own. If you just search up like college scholarship. 174 00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:09.990 huda: Yeah, yeah. 175 00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:11.810 Jenny Duan: cool. 176 00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.240 Jenny Duan: And then. 177 00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.180 Jenny Duan: so this is a really good 178 00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.949 Jenny Duan: like thing that you can read because 179 00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:28.450 Jenny Duan: the the selection, timeline, if you can navigate to that page because it tells you like what kind of things you should expect. So high school juniors so 180 00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:36.440 Jenny Duan: enrolling in college for the first time in fall 2024. That's you. Application. Deadline is February 2320 20. 181 00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.720 Jenny Duan: Oh, shoot! I don't think this is updated. 182 00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.110 huda: Yeah, you should say 183 00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:50.090 Jenny Duan: it should say 2023 to 2024. Let me see. 184 00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.470 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 185 00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.410 Jenny Duan: Cause. I think that the timeline should be open for 186 00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:18.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, never mind. Maybe it is not. Maybe it is not open, but application is open, though, cause. If you go on the application page, it's like accepting.",
    " 187 00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.300 huda: and Pope. 188 00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.280 Jenny Duan: Alright perfect. 189 00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:33.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, that's what I was thinking. because it should be open by now. Okay, so why don't we create your account for this? 190 00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:49.859 Jenny Duan: And I think after you create your account, this will be a time for you to share your screen, so we can look at the questions together, because obviously I don't have an account. I'm not applying for this, but so I won't have access to the questions. But if you could share your screen after you've created the account, that would be amazing. 191 00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.730 Jenny Duan: and then this will also give you a sense of what types of questions college applications will ask you to. 192 00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:56.850 huda: Yeah. 193 00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.029 huda: okay, there's like a lot of questions to sign up. So 194 00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.690 Jenny Duan: what kinds of questions. Is it asking you right now? 195 00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.280 huda: It's just like general, like background information like from 196 00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.149 huda: like my address and my phone number. And such 197 00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.320 Jenny Duan: great. 198 00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.270 Ivy Mentors: This is so amazing. 199 00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.080 Ivy Mentors: thanks a lot, Jenny. 200 00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:17.220 Ivy Mentors: I mean, just like the level of tactics and details and hand holding. You know, I think that that kind of a key? It's it's such a key difference. Would you agree? Houda? 201 00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.490 huda: Yeah, for sure. I'm really happy as a dad 202 00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.520 Ivy Mentors: and thank you so much. 203 00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.090 huda: both asking me for my counsellor's name. 204 00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:50.479 Jenny Duan: See this. This is exactly why we need to build a relationship wit",
    "h your counselor, because every application they might ask you about this 205 00:25:50.810 --> 00:26:08.699 Jenny Duan: like II guess now we can see kind of all the pieces coming together. Why, we're prioritizing that relationship is because they really do ask you which is something that you know most people don't know. But now that you know we are highlighting that it's something that you can be prepared for to have that extra le edge over other people, too. 206 00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:30.359 Jenny Duan: It's asking for her phone number. But I don't have her phone number. But this, okay. 207 00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:43.029 Jenny Duan: put the schools. Usually on the school website, you can find like their business phone number. So if you search up. You know her first name and last name, Mount House, High School. You'll probably be able to find it on this. The schools like Staff Page. 208 00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:47.610 Jenny Duan: and if not, then you can just put the school's phone number. It's okay. If you don't have her phone number. 209 00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.710 huda: Okay. 210 00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.450 huda: okay, 211 00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.190 Jenny Duan: amazing cool. 212 00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.200 huda: are they? So 213 00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.660 huda: it's due on February twenty-third. 214 00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.370 Jenny Duan: Perfect. 215 00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.550 huda: Oh. 216 00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.550 Jenny Duan: oh. 217 00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:29.109 Jenny Duan: oh, okay, it's okay. We can still look at the questions. 218 00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:36.849 Jenny Duan: It'll probably pretty similar. Okay, that's so interesting that they haven't opened the application. 219 00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:49.480 Jenny Duan: I mean that they haven't updated their website. Okay, let's look at. Let's look at what they're asking for, though. So we can be prepared. So if you scroll down, let's see letters of reference. Okay, let's leave what they're a",
    "sking for for letters of reference. 220 00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.489 Jenny Duan: because it'll probably be similar this year. So if you just open that 221 00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:59.789 Jenny Duan: 2 letters. Okay. so this is exactly what college applications look for, too 222 00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:08.409 Jenny Duan: like pretty similar one that can speak to your academic abilities and achievements, and the other who can speak to your character and accomplishments beyond the classroom. 223 00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:17.010 Jenny Duan: So just off the top of the off off the top of your head. Are there 2 teachers or 2 people that you have in mind for these 2 224 00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:25.939 huda: criteria? Yeah. So my, I feel like, maybe my computer science teacher will be able to vouch for. 225 00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:33.410 huda: We're actually my English teacher probably knows me better academically. And my 226 00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.049 huda: can you ask someone that doesn't teach at your school anymore. 227 00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.119 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's fine. It can be anyone. It can be anyone. It can be also like, if you do 228 00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:51.990 Jenny Duan: like a lot of people. They, if they have like mentors outside, they ask them for that. If they would like, volunteered a nonprofit, they asked. Their supervisor doesn't have to be a teacher. 229 00:28:53.130 --> 00:29:03.900 huda: Yeah. So I might ask, my former media art teacher cause she knows me like really personally rather than my other teachers. So yeah. 230 00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.190 Jenny Duan: amazing. 231 00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:12.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, so just thinking ahead, okay, you've identified 2 people. Let's look at the next section 232 00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.820 Jenny Duan: after letters of recommendation. What do they 233 00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.759 Jenny Duan: ask and press close, and then go to the next. Yeah. 234 00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:30.970 Jenny Duan: And t",
    "hen let's see, academic information is that, did you already? 235 00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.549 huda: Oh, you can't click. 236 00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.030 Jenny Duan: darn it. Okay, it would have been cool to see the essays that they would have asked you for that. 237 00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:48.170 Jenny Duan: But okay. let's see. since that's not open. let me see what other ones are open, I think. Actually, Ncw, it 238 00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.130 Jenny Duan: is might be open. 239 00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.539 Jenny Duan: So let me just check that cause. I got 240 00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.580 Jenny Duan: a social media post about that. 241 00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.800 Jenny Duan: So 242 00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.350 Jenny Duan: give me 1 s 243 00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.380 Eastern 244 00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.710 Ivy Mentors: Tusa. Now you know why it's important to invite your teachers to birthdays. 245 00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:33.320 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. I mean, they they all pull my leg, Jenny. I used to invite my teachers to my birthday when I was growing up, but you know I was a very previous student. So finally, I I'm glad that someone understand the important relationship. 246 00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:38.899 Jenny Duan: right? Because they they they do ask you, Huda, like they ask you for things like that which is pretty. 247 00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:48.259 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's it's pretty. It's pretty shocking, because most people don't know that. But you know, you can see how much of a difference it actually makes. 248 00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.470 Jenny Duan: So 249 00:30:50.080 --> 00:31:01.919 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, I think, Ncwit, you can sign up to make an application. But I don't think the applications are open yet. But actually, that's fine, because I have my previous 250 00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:18.470 Jenny Duan: I think they ask the same questions every single year, and I have the access to the question because I applied for it. So it's fine. Let m",
    "e just give these 2, and this is good that we can do this ahead that way, like when the application opens, you can just submit it, forget it and move on to the next thing you know, like, it's 251 00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.909 Jenny Duan: it, it's okay. If we do it a little bit early. In fact, that's actually better. 252 00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:28.080 Jenny Duan: Okay. So if you scroll down on the document 253 00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:38.209 Jenny Duan: you'll see that I'm putting the questions in. Please explain what sparked your interest in computing and technology. 254 00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.140 Jenny Duan: Tell us what you've been doing with technology. Give us specific details. And 255 00:31:46.550 --> 00:32:00.630 Jenny Duan: let's see. this is an optional question, and then is described. So you can already see that for every single one of these applications there's a ton of essays that you have to write. It's not as simple as like. 256 00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:09.710 Jenny Duan: you just submit something, and then, like. forget about it. You actually have to put pretty specific and specialized 257 00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.919 Jenny Duan: responses to all of these. 258 00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.860 huda: So are these prompts more like 259 00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:24.809 huda: you know how in college apps. You can have to tell like a metaphor, or is it more like straight to the point? 260 00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:39.909 Jenny Duan: No, it's always story telling, storytelling, storytelling, storytelling. That's the most important thing you can do. It doesn't necessarily have to be a metaphor. I mean, you can just tell it straight. But the point is, you need to tell it in a way that is different and stands out. 261 00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.900 Jenny Duan: So. okay. 262 00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:51.200 Jenny Duan: yeah, these are the questions that they had last year. They keep the same questions every single year, like, I've done this a couple of times, and it's always t",
    "he same question so 263 00:32:51.780 --> 00:33:20.899 Jenny Duan: pretty helpful to know ahead of time. And 4 or 500 word essays. That's like kind of a lot. So this is why it's good that we're starting early, because it's kind of a lot to write just for one essay. But the good thing is, once you have this narrative down, like once you have your story down, which is what we're trying to nail. You can easily apply this to other frameworks and other essays as well, like every anytime, you need to do an application, you can kind of adapt the essays that you already have does that make sense 264 00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.250 huda: yeah. 265 00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.650 Jenny Duan: amazing. So I think maybe today, we can just take this time, to brainstorm 266 00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.539 Jenny Duan: and that way, next week, we can like start getting drafts down for these essays. 267 00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.569 huda: Yeah, so 268 00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:53.690 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then, just to clarify like, this, application opens on September first. So it would be really great. Actually, if we could have this entire application done by September first. That way, we can just do the check in and submit it within that first week of September, so you can get it in pretty early. I think that would be good for you. What do you think? 269 00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.400 huda: Yeah, that's good. 270 00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:04.180 Jenny Duan: amazing. So just looking at this first question, Do you have any initial thoughts on like what sparked your interest? 271 00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.580 huda: Well, when I was younger I had this 272 00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:22.479 huda: robot, though I think it's called the Gmo Robot, and my dad bought it for me from like the Apple store, and I just thought was like the coolest thing ever just like 273 00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:29.000 huda: having it like you could control, like how it walks. You got to build it. And 274 00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:41",
    ".880 huda: it was actually using like and I thought it was just like, really cool, and I think Pacific inspired me. To like pursue it when it got older. 275 00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.790 huda: yeah. 276 00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.600 huda: Trying to think of something that isn't as like 277 00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.719 huda: cliche. 278 00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.170 huda: So 279 00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.550 huda: also, one thing is, I live in like the Bay Area, and 280 00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:11.259 huda: like, it's just you get to see like so many like founders and important people in terms of like computing and things. 281 00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:17.340 huda: and it really like sparked interest me. As a young person. 282 00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.000 huda: and 283 00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.729 huda: it definitely. 284 00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:30.720 huda: Oh, and since then I've been like trying to invent things just like them cause. When I was younger I like 285 00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:33.570 huda: I'd be amazed by them, but I've never really like 286 00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.400 huda: done anything but what I think one of part of the prompt is that 287 00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.030 huda: on is that 288 00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:47.709 huda: it, the interest furthered. And my experience of computing and technology. So 289 00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.590 huda: yeah, I definitely wanna create something. 290 00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.720 huda: Since I was young. 291 00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.679 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then this is actually well. 292 00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:08.260 Jenny Duan: like a strategy that I want to share with you. And I think we can really work on refining. And I think this is actually where many people in the Bay area actually get it wrong is like 293 00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:19.909 Jenny Duan: not emphasizing your cultural background or your background. General, because with these types of awards, this is award for women in computer science, they're re",
    "ally emphasizing. Now, let's just look at the website. So you can see for yourself. 294 00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:26.870 Jenny Duan: They wanna emphasize your background. And they wanna emphasize like where you come from. So 295 00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.769 Jenny Duan: let's see aspirations in computing. 296 00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.530 Jenny Duan: computing award. 297 00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.440 Jenny Duan: okay. 298 00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:55.699 Jenny Duan: and encourages them to pursue their passions. Award recipients are selected, based on their aptitude and aspirations in technology and computing as well as as demonstrated by their computing experience, computing related activities, leadership, experience, tenacity in the face of barriers to access and future plans. So 299 00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.710 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure like how to better say this, but 300 00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:24.579 Jenny Duan: I think, with any type of application, it's really really important to emphasize, like, how much you struggle to get to where you are like, even if you don't necessarily struggle that much. It's that's something that like they want to hear, and they want to hear how you've overcome like a certain challenge or background. And for you, that might be like not enough representation, not enough access being a woman in stem, etc., and really emphasizing that, does that make sense? Or does that like 301 00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.720 huda: confuse you? 302 00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.809 huda: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. I would say. One thing that definitely inspired me throughout is also like seeing, like all these 303 00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:56.649 huda: like male engineers and technology like heads, and then all just like I've never seen a woman ever being like a CEO were computer sense, major, for that fact. Growing up. And I think I just wanted to do it regardless that if I was a girl 304 00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.350 huda: and 305 00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:05.",
    "689 huda: also, just like the fact that in all these Cs classes that I'm taking 306 00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:14.130 huda: there's like, barely like a handful of girls in the classes. And it just feels like they always talk over us. And 307 00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.770 huda: I just feel like 308 00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.360 huda: I want to further my passion to show that I can 309 00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.940 huda: accomplish the same that they can. 310 00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:34.290 Ivy Mentors: if I may take a minute. Sorry to interrupt here, but I think it's and sorry I didn't mean to interrupt. But I think the last point that Jenny Huda mentioned right, and as as a dad 311 00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.280 Ivy Mentors: I can tell you that Houda's main struggle. 312 00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.890 Ivy Mentors: anxiety. 313 00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:46.080 Ivy Mentors: you know, it's really been very hyper local in her school. 314 00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:56.379 Jenny Duan: right? I think. And I think this is where I told that to be really to show your vulnerability and share, because you know Jenny is your mentor. She's your guide here right? I think you should open up 315 00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:04.390 Ivy Mentors: and her mental struggles. And because I live with her I'm her dad. I can kind of see how she struggles in. 316 00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.030 Ivy Mentors: you know, like for her like it's like the whole system is rigged. 317 00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:35.859 Ivy Mentors: you know. Ii just you know, like she couldn't. She's one of the best programmers, apparently, you know, in the school, but she could not get that leadership role. I think these are the things that kill her right. And she went to this whole. You know, Hackathon in Santa Cruz anytime she goes. She's not able to really gather students around her. She she's really left out, because also, she's new to the school. So I think 318 00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:57.470 Ivy Mentors: I feel like, really, genuinely and au",
    "thentically, I think everything else. Okay. My view that you're right on that. But I feel like that thing is is really very, very authentic and genuine with Huda and I as a parent, really struggle every day like I'm like. Tell me, what do I do? Do I need? Do I need to go and talk to his dad like, you know that kind of stuff right? Like, so yeah, so. 319 00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:08.510 Jenny Duan: And we reason I'm saying this is because admissions officers, they want to see your. They want to see a story. And that's why it's 320 00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:31.640 Jenny Duan: It's really important to like. Be able to tell your story. From like an authentic perspective, whether or not, that's, you know, moving to a new school. Whether or not that's not seeing representation. All these are really important. And they want to see that story. So actually like, I can read a part of my application to you and you can hear like how I tell my story, and you'll see what I mean by like 321 00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:58.450 Jenny Duan: when I say for one tell a story, and this is like pretty personal to me, too, but I can read it out loud to you, or I can just show you actually. So this is like what I wrote. This, this application for this question, this got me like a national award. But do you see what I mean by you really need to emphasize your background, and they want to hear you tell that story like, I have a pretty typical background, like my parents came to us to pursue education, graduate school education and computer science. 322 00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:09.060 Jenny Duan: And a lot of people have that similar background, like, you know, Asian parents coming to do school to to wherever to work. But this is the way I tell my story, and I think it's compelling, because 323 00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.549 Jenny Duan: you wanna have the reader feel like you. 324 00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:37.599 Jenny Duan: They want to feel your story like you don't need to tell it to them. You want them to f",
    "eel it, and when you read my story like, for example, this is why I'm saying I love how anyone with an idea can pursue coding. This is why I think it's imperative to make coding and computer science opportunities accessible and promoted to people from all backgrounds. And like, I'm the I'm talking about. I'm the only girl to come to the meetings. It inspires me to share my love for technology. I say, coding is collaborative. 325 00:41:37.880 --> 00:42:05.570 Jenny Duan: and then, in the beginning, you know, I'm talking about my story how my dad came here with nothing but $200 to pursue graduate degree at in computer engineering, talking about my background like how I started to learn how to code and how I, you know, became interested in that, and really, really trying to sell my story that way, making it very, very personal because you wanna have a story that stands out and you want them to feel your story. Lots people might have the same background as you like lots of people move schools. Lots of people, you know. 326 00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:13.869 Jenny Duan: do all these different things. But how do you tell it? In a way that's unique. And how do you tell that in a way that makes them feel like they know you on a personal level? 327 00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.549 huda: Do you understand what I mean by that? Yeah, for sure. 328 00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:36.129 Jenny Duan: So that's what I'm really trying to get at with your story like, how do you tell it? In a way that's unique to you? And how do you really sell? What's unique about you? And what's unique about you is, you know, you've moved a ton. You're from the Bay area. You're Muslim. I don't think we should discount that again. I think you really need to 329 00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:53.159 Jenny Duan: at least emphasize that in some way, because that's a very underre under represented group in technology, especially because there's not a lot of women, Ceos. There's even less women, Muslim, Ceos. And that's very impo",
    "rtant to see like that's who you are. That's something you should emphasize. I think. 330 00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.810 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? Yeah. 331 00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.030 huda: definitely. 332 00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.550 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think we can pause this brainstorming session here. But I think this is 333 00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:22.289 Jenny Duan: a good start for us to think about. You know, how do we strategize your story? Not just for applications like this. But this is. This is a useful thinking exercise, for you know your other applications as well as your college applications as well, because, again, at the heart of everything. Is your story like, how do you bring out who you are in a unique way? That 334 00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:35.179 Jenny Duan: yeah, what makes you special? And how do you tell your story to stand out from other people. Because again, there's a million Bay area students. There's a million Bay area Cs students. But what makes you different? And how do you share that with other people? 335 00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:39.289 Jenny Duan: Okay? And we can put a pause there. But do you have any questions? 336 00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.920 huda: Yeah, so 337 00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:47.119 huda: would it really like, okay. So one thing I wanted to convey is 338 00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:52.699 huda: in my school. There's there are girls in Cs, but 339 00:43:53.060 --> 00:44:20.560 huda: they just like really are really unmotivated and where guys will like create clubs and try to give each other officer roles the girls. Honestly, just don't really do anything which is kind of like a struggle I faced with like, I know II don't have to stick with only girls, but it's definitely harder to like collaborate with other girls, and empower them when they honestly don't even care about 340 00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:29.899 huda: cool. So I kind of wanted to do that in my essay definitely. That's definitely something you can incorporate.",
    " 341 00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:36.730 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. And I think, that's a good point. And I'm glad that you brought up your story as well, that shows right. Because 342 00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:58.000 Ivy Mentors: II think one thing I've also started with is saying like, Please bring out this vulnerability like there's nothing to be ashamed. In fact, that's your super power. Because when I look at like Bay Area founders and like, that's all like, you know, very cliche, as you rightly said without yourself. But that, and also it's very generally the thing. And I was talking about this hackathon. 343 00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:21.070 Ivy Mentors: That's precisely the struggle that faced that. She took the initiative. People just like jumped on her web wagon didn't go. They didn't help her. She was literally the only person there, right? So in some ways. That's a barrier for her as well, because she's not getting she's not able to rally around and bring people who can really support her. And I think the the 344 00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.250 Ivy Mentors: girls thing being one 345 00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:49.580 Ivy Mentors: in a very guys dominate kind of school and and clubs, but also like not having enough kind of thing, and I think this is where I feel like the struggles are, and I don't know. And and and you said right like might be. That's where her struggle and she still for our passion, can form something online. And I don't know, like, I'm just like throwing some ideas here. So that's that's a great great guidance. Here, Jen. 346 00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.559 Jenny Duan: cool. Yeah. So I think 347 00:45:52.690 --> 00:46:09.530 Jenny Duan: we can put a pause in this. Come back to this strategy next week. But I just wanna make sure that you're set to do all the things that we talked about in our list. So sending the email out, and then everything else. Do you need any other support for me right now? Before you start all these activities? 348 00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.59",
    "9 huda: Oh, no, that sounds good. 349 00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. Then. In that case I will see you over the weekend. 350 00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.219 huda: Thank you very much."

I've done it before. It's pretty cool. 94 and it's about 3 weeks long. So a lot of these programs are pretty short, so you might be able to do 2 of them. So just putting that on your radar.
