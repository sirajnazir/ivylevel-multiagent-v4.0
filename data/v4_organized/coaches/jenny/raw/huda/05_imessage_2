No need to apologize :) I would say power sorry to spam you! this is another Looks good otherwise for the first one Looks good! Fri, Mar 1 at 7:17PM there’s a really big roadblock!! my teacher didn’t submit his letter of recommendation for cmu even though i’ve been reminding him daily for a week! it’s not letting me submit :( Oh no!!! Email your application to the email And explain the issue Put it all in a PDF and email them And send your teacher another follow up today Like right now That looks great! Fingers coursed Crossed Just sent this email i’m really upset with my teacher because i’ve genuinely been reminding him everyday in person \" \" :(( That must be so frustrating to hear especially since you’ve been reminding him What did he say when you reminded him irl? he said “yeah i can do that” \" \" nooooo Maybe he’ll get it in before 8:59pm One time I had a teacher do that and it honestly stressed me out SO much But they did eventually get it in - 1 min before the deadline… 1 I never asked them for a rec after that omg i would freak out that’s so scary… Fri, Mar 1 at 9:30PM Update? Fri, Mar 1 at 10:53PM haven’t got an update : I would not start with “I want to preface this” because it sounds like you feel guilty when you don’t necessarily need to be! I would just say - I want to sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart for relentless supporting me throughout my process applying for summer programs. .. etc etc. and instead of saying I’m sorry… I would say I really appreciate your efforts in accommodating tight deadlines- I understand how much pressure they put and will be more mindful of my asks moving forward. I am grateful to have you as a resource and I’m excited to continue working with you during my time at MHS. Due to your support, I was able to… Take out the oops this… and the signature is great! You can leave the this journey part for the in person vonvo this is what i have for my teacher btw Looks great! Sun, Mar 3 at 11:12PM Check out Morehead-Cain's video. TikTok · Morehead-Cain tiktok.com mental health ideas Mon, Mar 4 at 8:35AM the admissions team got back to me \" i’m not sure what they mean because i requested 1-2 weeks ago and just sent reminders multiple times Mon, Mar 4 at 11:11AM okay so i talked to my teacher about the recommendation and he felt really bad but he submitted the reccomendation to cmu so i cant apply to ais anymore but i applied to the games program Mon, Mar 4 at 12:23PM also, sorry for the spam again, but just submitted to kwk summer! my essay: Tell us about a group or community you belong to. What makes this group or community special to who you are? This could include personal interests, cultural connections, social circles- and beyond. I'm a Muslim-Indian girl, a seemingly rare occurrence. Growing up, I had the struggle of explaining myself to close-minded people who thought only Pakistani Muslims and Indian Hindus existed, having to constantly prove them of my community's existence. As an insecure child tired of explaining myself, I would introduce myself as Pakistani due to the sheer amount of people that tried convincing me that I wasn't Indian or Muslim. As I grew, I learned that at the end of the day, I am Indian, and I am Muslim. My identity is what makes me who I am– celebrating Indian independence day while also fasting during Ramadan. Supporting the Indian cricket team while also going to Friday prayers. Braiding my hair and placing Indian Jasmines in it while also teaching Sunday School at my local mosque. Speaking Hindi, an Indian language, while also writing and reading in Arabic. It is these factors; these cultural traditions, that make me, me. I cannot be confined within certain expectations of who I should be, or if my identity even exists. Mon, Mar 4 at 2:37PM the admissions team got back to me \" i’m not sure what they mean because i requested 1-2 weeks ago and just sent reminders multiple times That’s so frustrating and I’m so sorry :( I think in the future these should be our takeaways 1. Ask for the LOR when you start the application— 3-4 weeks in advance+ 2. Not asking media arts teacher for more recs in the future Amazing!! KWK will be awesome !

Sun, Mar 24 at 4:46PM hello!! so i’m filling out the application for games for change, and it seems i have to make a decision , between the writing challenges and submitting my game Hmm that’s ok! In that case submit the game 2 and i have to categorize it under a sustainability category but im not sure how much it applies to synthoria \" Wait why do you have to categorize it? the other options are “recycle the runway” or recycling fashion and “be clean wise” i think there are different categories so they can choose the best in each one Oh no you have to categorize Categorize? there are still awards such as made with unity but they have to apply to one of the social impact themes i chose stronger and greener community because maybe i could explain some scenes such as the tree example or ai bias as advocating for greener communities So they still have to apply to one of the social impact songs no matter what?

Tue, Aug 27 at 9:23AM yes! see you then Tue, Aug 27 at 11:12PM Amazing! Thu, Aug 29 at 6:03AM Hi Huda!! Can you check if you’re eligible for the Questbridge scholarship? QuestBridge questbridge.org questbridge.org National college match: QuestBridge Application apply.questbridge.org Thu, Aug 29 at 10:39AM hi! - here’s my Riley’s way scholarship essays done! Sign-in docs.google.com Hi Huda!! Can you check if you’re eligible for the Questbridge scholarship? let me check with my dad looks like i am eligible! hi! - here’s my Riley’s way scholarship essays done! Awesome! I’ll take a look today In this case, let’s actually plan to apply via the Questbridge NCM scholarship. It’ll up your chances and also give you a full ride if you match. We can proceed with the same schools as discussed - would you be able to create an account today? The application is similar to commonapp so no worries about the main essay, just means we will need to accelerate slightly as the deadline is approaching i just checked and i think i already made one earlier Perfect! are the prompts similar? would i be able to use the same essay? Would you be able to take a look at the app when you get a chance? I think so, I need to confirm yes i have some free time so i can try working on the basic information right now!! Also if you have the chance maybe it would be a good idea to talk to your teachers sooner rather than later about recs, unsure if the recommender deadline is the same or later ok sounds good- let me check when recommendations are due Okay great looks like october 3rd is the deadline The other thing is through questbridge if you match you have to go— so that’s something to consider It’s binding So we can weigh the benefits of questbridge NCM vs REA vs other options wait does ranking affect the likeliness of getting in? You can rank up to 12 schools via questbridge ranking like school rank? Or what type of ranking like for example i put stanford for 3rd rank and MIT for 1st, would that impact stanford decision in accepting/denying me Actually I say let’s pause asking teachers for LOR while we consider the benefits and costs Ohhh No They just go down the list It doesn’t matter on your chance of admission Actually I say let’s pause asking teachers for LOR while we consider the benefits and costs alright sound good- i think i’ll ask them in september anyways as that’s what my english teach recommended last year as well It’s just if the first school doesn’t admit you you just move on to second school then third etc like mid september So there’s a chance you could match with, say your #9 school if you decide to put that many on And then you’d have to go But you can decide how many schools you rank but ideally you would be comfortable attending any of them i think that shouldn’t be much of a problem as I somewhat have an idea of what order i would like to put them obviously need to think about majors but generally i have an idea and this vs. ED is usually what people think about because at some schools ED gives a big boost, however I don’t think this applies in your case because Stanford REALLY doesn’t increase chances Okay great ’ This is one student’s perspective wait to clarify- is questbridge selective? like if I weren’t to get into the questbridge program would i still have a chance at those universities Questbridge is selective yes If you don’t match through QB I believe you can apply are RD ohhhh so it’s like a way to ED to a lot of schools basically Yes! but with a guaranteed full scholarship hmm my SAT isn’t that high there’s another opportunity at my school to take it but i’m not sure if it would look bad on my application Thu, Aug 29 at 9:27PM hey jenny! do you think i can go ahead and submit the application for the riley’s way program? Hey Huda!! Sorry I haven’t gotten a chance to take a look yet— I’ll review it tomorrow morning and get oo ye— revew omorrow mornng an ge back to you before 10 for that 24 hour turnaround if that’s okay! Otherwise if you want to submit it tonight I can take a cursory read right now I think this first paragraph can be a bit more specific I think as a reader without context I’d be a bit confused by the first sentence- what does it mean to gain seniority? What are your projects? Here it makes it sound like you were just given opportunities even though you’ve put in tons of hard work to create them :)) I’ll do a more in depth edit tomorrow morning but those were the first things that stood out about the first essay I like this essay a lot! I’d love to see more about how teaching relates to leadership in this context NSF invites K-12 students to design their own video games and compete for Game Maker Awards new.nsf.gov Fri, Aug 30 at 9:45AM Done making edits! Gotcha-- do you plan to submit your SAT to stanford and usc REA/EA? Thu, Sep 5 at 11:03AM hey jenny, my english teacher agreed to writing me a LOR! should I submit the request to her? it looks like USC accepts one LOR, so i just wanted to check if i should select her for USC Thu, Sep 5 at 12:16PM Awesome!! Do you think she’s the most representative for you? If so, that sounds great! Sat, Oct 5 at 12:09PM Hi!! I’m wondering if you’d be available to meet earlier tomorrow instead of 8-9? If not that time still works with me! But if you are free anytime before 1pm that would also be great! Sat, Oct 5 at 8:43PM unfortunately can’t do an earlier time because of sunday school volunteering 4 No worries!

Fri, Mar 1 at 7:17PM there’s a really big roadblock!! my teacher didn’t submit his letter of recommendation for cmu even though i’ve been reminding him daily for a week! it’s not letting me submit :( Oh no!!! Email your application to the email And explain the issue Put it all in a PDF and email them And send your teacher another follow up today Like right now That looks great! Fingers coursed Crossed Just sent this email i’m really upset with my teacher because i’ve genuinely been reminding him everyday in person \" \" :(( That must be so frustrating to hear especially since you’ve been reminding him What did he say when you reminded him irl? he said “yeah i can do that” \" \" nooooo Maybe he’ll get it in before 8:59pm One time I had a teacher do that and it honestly stressed me out SO much But they did eventually get it in - 1 min before the deadline… 1 I never asked them for a rec after that omg i would freak out that’s so scary… Fri, Mar 1 at 9:30PM Update?

What makes this group or community special to who you are? This could include personal interests, cultural connections, social circles- and beyond. I'm a Muslim-Indian girl, a seemingly rare occurrence. Growing up, I had the struggle of explaining myself to close-minded people who thought only Pakistani Muslims and Indian Hindus existed, having to constantly prove them of my community's existence. As an insecure child tired of explaining myself, I would introduce myself as Pakistani due to the sheer amount of people that tried convincing me that I wasn't Indian or Muslim. As I grew, I learned that at the end of the day, I am Indian, and I am Muslim. My identity is what makes me who I am– celebrating Indian independence day while also fasting during Ramadan. Supporting the Indian cricket team while also going to Friday prayers. Braiding my hair and placing Indian Jasmines in it while also teaching Sunday School at my local mosque. Speaking Hindi, an Indian language, while also writing and reading ",
    "in Arabic. It is these factors; these cultural traditions, that make me, me. I cannot be confined within certain expectations of who I should be, or if my identity even exists. Mon, Mar 4 at 2:37PM the admissions team got back to me \" i’m not sure what they mean because i requested 1-2 weeks ago and just sent reminders multiple times That’s so frustrating and I’m so sorry :( I think in the future these should be our takeaways 1. Ask for the LOR when you start the application— 3-4 weeks in advance+ 2. Not asking media arts teacher for more recs in the future Amazing!! KWK will be awesome !

Sign-in docs.google.com Hi Huda!! Can you check if you’re eligible for the Questbridge scholarship? let me check with my dad looks like i am eligible! hi! - here’s my Riley’s way scholarship essays done! Awesome! I’ll take a look today In this case, let’s actually plan to apply via the Questbridge NCM scholarship. It’ll up your chances and also give you a full ride if you match. We can proceed with the same schools as discussed - would you be able to create an account today? The application is similar to commonapp so no worries about the main essay, just means we will need to accelerate slightly as the deadline is approaching i just checked and i think i already made one earlier Perfect! are the prompts similar? would i be able to use the same essay? Would you be able to take a look at the app when you get a chance? I think so, I need to confirm yes i have some free time so i can try working on the basic information right now!! Also if you have the chance maybe it would be a good idea to talk to your teachers sooner rather than later about recs, unsure if the recommender de",
    "adline is the same or later ok sounds good- let me check when recommendations are due Okay great looks like october 3rd is the deadline The other thing is through questbridge if you match you have to go— so that’s something to consider It’s binding So we can weigh the benefits of questbridge NCM vs REA vs other options wait does ranking affect the likeliness of getting in? You can rank up to 12 schools via questbridge ranking like school rank? Or what type of ranking like for example i put stanford for 3rd rank and MIT for 1st, would that impact stanford decision in accepting/denying me Actually I say let’s pause asking teachers for LOR while we consider the benefits and costs Ohhh No They just go down the list It doesn’t matter on your chance of admission Actually I say let’s pause asking teachers for LOR while we consider the benefits and costs alright sound good- i think i’ll ask them in september anyways as that’s what my english teach recommended last year as well It’s just if the first school doesn’t admit you you just move on to second school then third etc like mid september So there’s a chance you could match with, say your #9 school if you decide to put that many on And then you’d have to go But you can decide how many schools you rank but ideally you would be comfortable attending any of them i think that shouldn’t be much of a problem as I somewhat have an idea of what order i would like to put them obviously need to think about majors but generally i have an idea and this vs. ED is usually what people think about because at some schools ED gives a big boost, however I don’t think this applies in your case because Stanford REALLY doesn’t increase chances Okay great ’ This is one student’s perspective wait to clarify- is questbridge selective? like if I weren’t to get into the questbridge program would i still have a chance at those universities Questbridge is selective yes If you don’t match through QB I believe you can apply are RD ohhhh so it’s like a ",
    "way to ED to a lot of schools basically Yes! but with a guaranteed full scholarship hmm my SAT isn’t that high there’s another opportunity at my school to take it but i’m not sure if it would look bad on my application Thu, Aug 29 at 9:27PM hey jenny! do you think i can go ahead and submit the application for the riley’s way program? Hey Huda!! Sorry I haven’t gotten a chance to take a look yet— I’ll review it tomorrow morning and get oo ye— revew omorrow mornng an ge back to you before 10 for that 24 hour turnaround if that’s okay! Otherwise if you want to submit it tonight I can take a cursory read right now I think this first paragraph can be a bit more specific I think as a reader without context I’d be a bit confused by the first sentence- what does it mean to gain seniority? What are your projects? Here it makes it sound like you were just given opportunities even though you’ve put in tons of hard work to create them :)) I’ll do a more in depth edit tomorrow morning but those were the first things that stood out about the first essay I like this essay a lot!

      "text": "We can proceed with the same schools as discussed - would you be able to create an account today? The application is similar to commonapp so no worries about the main essay, just means we will need to accelerate slightly as the deadline is approaching i just checked and i think i already made one earlier Perfect! are the prompts similar? would i be able to use the same essay? Would you be able to take a look at the app when you get a chance? I think so, I need to confirm yes i have some free time so i can try working on the basic information right now!! Also if you have the chance maybe it would be a good idea to talk to your teachers sooner rather than later about recs, unsure if the recommender deadline is the same or later ok sounds good- let me check when recommendations are due Okay great looks like october 3rd is the deadline The other thing is through questbridge if you match you have to go— so that’s something to consider It’s binding So we can weigh the benefits of questbridge NCM vs REA vs other options wait does ranking affect the likeliness of getting in? You can rank up to 12 schools via questbridge ranking like school rank? Or what type of ranking like for example i put stanford for 3rd rank and MIT for 1st, would that impact stanford decision in accepting/denying me Actually I say let’s pause asking teachers for LOR while we consider the benefits and costs Ohhh No They just go down the list It doesn’t matter on your chance of admission Actually I say let’s pause asking teachers for LOR while we consider the benefits and costs alright sound good- i think i’ll ask them in september anyways as that’s what my english teach recommended last year as well It’s just if the first school doesn’t admit you you just move on to second school then third etc like mid september So there’s a chance you could match with, say your #9 school if you decide to put that many on And then you’d have to go But you can decide how many schools you rank but ideally you would be comfortable attending any of them i think that shouldn’t be much of a problem as I somewhat have an idea of what order i would like to put them obviously need to think about majors but generally i have an idea and this vs.",

      "text": "ED is usually what people think about because at some schools ED gives a big boost, however I don’t think this applies in your case because Stanford REALLY doesn’t increase chances Okay great ’ This is one student’s perspective wait to clarify- is questbridge selective? like if I weren’t to get into the questbridge program would i still have a chance at those universities Questbridge is selective yes If you don’t match through QB I believe you can apply are RD ohhhh so it’s like a way to ED to a lot of schools basically Yes! but with a guaranteed full scholarship hmm my SAT isn’t that high there’s another opportunity at my school to take it but i’m not sure if it would look bad on my application Thu, Aug 29 at 9:27PM hey jenny! do you think i can go ahead and submit the application for the riley’s way program? Hey Huda!! Sorry I haven’t gotten a chance to take a look yet— I’ll review it tomorrow morning and get oo ye— revew omorrow mornng an ge back to you before 10 for that 24 hour turnaround if that’s okay! Otherwise if you want to submit it tonight I can take a cursory read right now I think this first paragraph can be a bit more specific I think as a reader without context I’d be a bit confused by the first sentence- what does it mean to gain seniority? What are your projects? Here it makes it sound like you were just given opportunities even though you’ve put in tons of hard work to create them :)) I’ll do a more in depth edit tomorrow morning but those were the first things that stood out about the first essay I like this essay a lot! I’d love to see more about how teaching relates to leadership in this context NSF invites K-12 students to design their own video games and compete for Game Maker Awards new.nsf.gov Fri, Aug 30 at 9:45AM Done making edits! Gotcha-- do you plan to submit your SAT to stanford and usc REA/EA? Thu, Sep 5 at 11:03AM hey jenny, my english teacher agreed to writing me a LOR! should I submit the request to her? it looks like USC accepts one LOR, so i just wanted to check if i should select her for USC Thu, Sep 5 at 12:16PM Awesome!! Do you think she’s the most representative for you? If so, that sounds great! Sat, Oct 5 at 12:09PM Hi!! I’m wondering if you’d be available to meet earlier tomorrow instead of 8-9? If not that time still works with me! But if you are free anytime before 1pm that would also be great! Sat, Oct 5 at 8:43PM unfortunately can’t do an earlier time because of sunday school volunteering 4 No worries! Lets stick with 8-9 then :) Sun, Oct 6 at 4:45PM hey jenny! i had a talk with my parents, and we agreed that applying early to unc will be a good opportunity for me i emailed my teachers regarding the",
