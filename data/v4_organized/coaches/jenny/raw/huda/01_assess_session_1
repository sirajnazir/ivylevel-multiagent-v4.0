  "text": "1 00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.810 Jenny Duan: Hi, Huda, how's it going? 2 00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.980 huda: Okay. 3 00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.170 Jenny Duan: Hi, it's really nice to meet you. I'm Jenny, and I go to Stanford, and I'd love to learn a little bit more about you. 4 00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.720 huda: Hmm. 5 00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.290 huda: yeah. I don't know if my dad shared the document already. 6 00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.280 huda: Probably I could share. You know I wasn't back to my calls. Yeah, so feel free to bring it up, and you can share it as well. 7 00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.670 Ivy Mentors: Thanks, Jenny, for joining. And also who does that. So I'm I'm just, gonna you know. Listen to this. thanks for your time. 8 00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.279 Jenny Duan: of course. Yeah. 9 00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:15.799 Jenny Duan: So I can go ahead and introduce myself. And then I'd love to learn a little bit more about you and I have a couple of questions for you as well, but I'm excited to be working together. 10 00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.750 huda: Yeah, me, too 11 00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:44.069 Jenny Duan: awesome. So I'm an incoming sophomore at Stanford. And I'm studying symbolic systems, which is an interdisciplinary major that combines computer science philosophy and psychology. I personally think it's a really cool program, especially because I'm the type of person who had a lot of different interest in high school and wanted to combine them all to make a new thing. But what I'm really passionate about is artificial intelligence, and that's what I'm studying in school. 12 00:01:44.310 --> 00:02:10.100 Jenny Duan: and in high school I was involved with a lot of different things. your dad told me that you're you're interested in film and in high school. I also made documentary videos, and that was one of the things that I found really rewarding and valuable to. So I'm excited to connect on that. But I'd love to learn a little bit more about you. So maybe where you go to school, and some of the things that you're interested in. 13 00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:28.769 huda: Yeah. So my name is Heather and I go to Mountain House. My school. it's not as competitive and definitely like. It's in the Dublin area. If you know where that is? And 14 00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.769 huda: so it's not that competitive. But 15 00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:40.449 huda: as for my passions, I'm really interested in in computer science and just like you artificial intelligence? 16 00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.760 and also phone 17 00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:51.919 huda: and I'm looking to major in a film for some schools and computer science and some other schools. 18 00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.360 huda: and I just really needed guidance for, like my extra curriculum, because my profile is pretty weak. So 19 00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.300 huda: yeah. 20 00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:14.270 Jenny Duan: yeah, And can you tell me how you're feeling about this process in the types of things that you're worried about. So you mentioned that you're looking for help in extracurriculars? Why does this stand out as an area that you want to work on. 21 00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.070 huda: Yeah, definitely. So 22 00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:32.939 huda: for extracurriculars. I sometimes I don't know what to do, because it's so vague and there's never like specific things that we're told to do. for example, I don't have that many awards or owners 23 00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:45.819 huda: and like I just don't know what to search for, and I kind of needed specific help on finding these things. because I had a previous mentor who 24 00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:56.970 huda: told me to find film festivals that are national, but didn't have them any competitors. And I've tried searching for them. But they're obviously kind of hard to find. So 25 00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.330 Jenny Duan: yeah, completely. So 26 00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:24.650 Jenny Duan: this is really useful information for me. Can you talk about your experience in school? So far? So you mentioned that? this is a public school? Right? Yeah, yeah. So we'll have a some time to go over your extra curriculum and dive really deep into that film aspect later. But I love to learn about how you're feeling about school and what classes. And subjects you're, interested in and what classes you've taken so far 27 00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:45.019 huda: so I'm by the end of high school. I've taken 11 a piece and 5 honors. and I think I'd say my academic rigor is pretty high and I'm also, applying to like a community college course to take this full 28 00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.429 huda: and I got a 5 on the Ap Hub exam. and I just I think my academic rigor is probably one of my 29 00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.309 huda: strength, but I don't think that has much of a weight in the actual decision itself. So 30 00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.250 huda: yeah. 31 00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.130 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah, so can you tell me what your Gpa is? So far? 32 00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.659 huda: Yeah. So I have a 4.3 Gpa. 33 00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.260 huda: and 4 unrelated. 34 00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.999 huda: I think it was like 3.9 6 or something like that. 35 00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.009 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And do you know how this compares to sort of the other people in your school 36 00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:29.869 huda: so I think, like many people have the same around the same Gpa or less. 37 00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.240 huda: they have they offer like 18 aps at our school. 38 00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:50.650 huda: I'm taking 11 just because you're not allowed to take any of them in freshman year and sophomore. You only took one because we moved here this summer before freshman year, so I couldn't sign up for one of the Aps. 39 00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.109 huda: So I think that's somewhere where I kinda missed that on 40 00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:08.550 Jenny Duan: yeah, totally understand? And you mentioned that you're signing up for community college classes. Is that right? Do you know what impact those have on your Gpa. If any, or is it separate from your gpu? 41 00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:20.870 huda: It's separate, but It does come as credits. And I've heard that they kind of have a they show that you're more rigorous. And you're trying to outsource different 42 00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.250 huda: programs. So I feel like, I think it's beneficial to your academics. 43 00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And what costs are you considering taking at the community college. 44 00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.060 huda: I'll say I'm taking psi or a film production. 45 00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.719 Jenny Duan: of course, that community college. Why, Polyside 46 00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.420 huda: just because it's 47 00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:52.599 huda: kind of like one of our courses at our schools govern Econ. And I kind of want like a foundation for that. And I think it's just pretty interesting as a class. 48 00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.720 Jenny Duan: And are you deciding between those 2? Are you pretty set on taking Polyside? 49 00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:06.480 huda: I'm still deciding, but I think I'm kind of leaning towards film, actually, because it kinda shows it. I'm interested in reaching out more. 50 00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:21.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would also probably recommend you to take that phone class, just because it connects with the other things that you're passionate as well. passionate in as well. And So I took a look at your extracurriculars. They look great. I 51 00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:39.360 Jenny Duan: be willing to talk about them further in detail in a little bit. So we'll come back to this. But I'm curious what kind of roles you see yourself taking up at school because I looked at your extracurriculars, and a lot of them are outside of school. So I'm curious to see. What kind of roles you're you see yourself in at school? 52 00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:57.159 Jenny Duan: Are you involved in any clubs? I know you're part of the I think. Vfx Club. which is awesome, your president. But at school would you say that? You know you're more? Do you talk a lot in your classes. Are you more quiet? Do you have a big friend group? Can you tell me about how school is going for you? 53 00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:10.379 huda: So I'm kind of like a quiet person. I do have like a friend group, but and they do like take academic seriously. But I feel like, yeah, I am definitely more of a quiet person at school. 54 00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.570 Jenny Duan: And would you say that your friend group is 55 00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:25.570 Jenny Duan: a a bit competitive, or is it more collaborative? How would you describe, because I've heard a lot about the Bay area. So you know, I'm just curious to hear your perspective on that. 56 00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:45.339 huda: Hmm. There's like a couple of people who are competitive or more collaborative. But most of them honestly don't take school that seriously. But the ones that do are definitely more collaborative. cause. Actually, me and my friend are thinking of starting a machine learning club at our school. 57 00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.950 huda: and we're trying to expand it so that other schools can have the same code 58 00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.900 Jenny Duan: that's really awesome. 59 00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:17.930 Jenny Duan: and the reason why I'm asking this is because I'm trying to get a sense of some things that your teachers or your peers might say about you, because for a lot of these really competitive schools that we're looking at applying to like Ucla mit Stanford, etc. That you have on your list. one important aspect of this is your letter of recommendation, for so have you thought about what teachers you want to ask, because I think Junior Year is a great 60 00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:24.689 huda: time to start thinking about that 61 00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:42.119 huda: teacher at like a few years, I think, on freshman year and sophomore year. Actually, And she's actually going into the film industry. And we've been like pretty close, and she knows me pretty well personally. So. 62 00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:51.939 huda: I'm thinking of getting a letter of recommendation for her, because she knows like my passion for film production. And she's from the business. So yeah. 63 00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.270 huda: And I'm also thinking of asking, like. 64 00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.060 huda: maybe my English teachers, and she knows 65 00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.760 huda: Well, she's like 66 00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:16.739 huda: a pretty good writer. And also she sent several students in her class to the John Locke writing competition. So I feel like getting a letter of recommendation from her is definitely prestigious. 67 00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:40.550 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's awesome. So the first one is, did you say that they were a film teacher? Or what subject? Okay, awesome. And do you have a stem teacher that's willing to write you a lot of recommendation, because usually colleges, especially since you have this strong technical background as well. It would be useful to have someone talk about your skills and math computer science or another stem field. 68 00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.629 huda: Yeah, I definitely, I have a a computer science teacher. 69 00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.389 huda: she's taught me since sophomore year, and I think 70 00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.849 huda: to senior. So we'll probably have like a good bond by then. So yeah. 71 00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:02.550 Jenny Duan: okay, so I would. When considering your letters of recommendation. I'd probably try to focus on that stem teacher and that English teacher for your main 72 00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:27.540 Jenny Duan: level for your main recommendation. But then you'll also have the option to add a third recommender which could be your film teacher. And the reason for this is that the letters of recommendation are another really good way to talk about your intellectual maturity and the things that you're interested in on an intellectual level and having a strong stem. And English teacher will just highlight how academically prepared you are to thrive at a school 73 00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:37.770 that you're looking at. Well, the third, the film teacher, might be able to talk about your passions, and the extracurricular involvement that you that you have, as well as your leadership in that Vfx Club, which is super important. 74 00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.769 Jenny Duan: So I would probably keep that top of mind as you enter your senior year 75 00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:54.759 Jenny Duan: and So another thing that I wanted to ask you about is, just what do you have any idea of what you want to do in the future as in career pads and navigating that. 76 00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:02.160 huda: Yeah. So I wanna definitely get into the software engineering field. 77 00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:12.790 huda: if I do an end up majoring in computer science, because I'm thinking of planning, or I'm thinking of applying to public schools as a 78 00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:20.560 huda: computer science major and private schools as a film major, in case like, I decide to switch or minor in the other. 79 00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.480 huda: but I also have. like 80 00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.929 huda: aspirations of being a film producer 81 00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.000 huda: and being in like the 82 00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.480 huda: movie business. 83 00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:53.030 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is really awesome. So one thing that I'm seeing is this dynamic between film and the technical aspect of Cs right? I think, when crafting your application or looking at your college journey so far, it's maybe interesting and important to find a connection between these 2 aspects. Because. 84 00:12:53.030 --> 00:13:15.199 Jenny Duan: you know, when you're applying for college, you're really showing your whole person. You're not just saying like, I'm only a Cs major, or I am only a film student. You are a person with these interests, and you're trying to present them forwards. And you're right to apply Cs at a public school because, you choosing that because you can't really switch your major. Is that? Why? Yeah, okay? So 85 00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:31.870 Jenny Duan: actually, I have another question for you. If you want to do Cs to do software engineering, why, computer science, do you like coding? Or do you want to become a software engineer? Because if you want to become a software engineer, you don't necessarily need to be a Cs major, or do you love coding. 86 00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:51.560 huda: I I really like coding because I've been I've been coding for like a really long time since. I'd say, like even starting at 8. I started doing like basic coding things. I feel like it's always fascinated me. I've built games. And on this is like, it's just. 87 00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.450 huda: I think I want to major in computer science, because 88 00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.609 huda: well, it's like 89 00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:03.100 huda: good to have Cs as your major. If you're pursuing the fuel. 90 00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:22.089 Jenny Duan: Yeah, totally. the thing that we can consider when doing Cs applications is that it does make it a lot harder, obviously, to get into schools. But if there's another alternative, maybe depending on the school. We can consider things like data signs, cognitive science, information, technology and 91 00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:38.269 Jenny Duan: other similar fields that would still empower you to become a software engineer, but perhaps are not as competitive to get into as Acs program. So we can talk about that moving forward. But one thing that I see in you right now is you have a passion for creating things? 92 00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.570 Jenny Duan: Would you say that? That's true? Yeah. 93 00:14:40.850 --> 00:15:05.429 Jenny Duan: definitely, I see that definitely in your Vfx. In the game that you created as well as your love for film. And I think that this is where I see the connection between film and Cs. You like to bring things to life, whether or not that's a game, whether or not that's a video. You like to share stories. And I think that code can be a medium for sharing stories. So I think that this is a really good sort of intersection. We can 94 00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:15.129 Jenny Duan: capture like this love for storytelling and bringing worlds to life. Because, you know, when you're creating a video, you're shooting a situation and you have the creative 95 00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:40.119 Jenny Duan: potential and transforming the ordinary into extraordinary things like you can take an ordinary, you know, image the other people might not see and turn into something beautiful in a documentary, or take a couple of lines of code which you know, code is just a tool to create something greater, to create a story through your game. So I think that that is something really, really powerful, that I think is really special in your journey. do you have any thoughts on that? 96 00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:51.820 huda: Yeah, I think definitely like, I really want to tie the my true passions together, because I really want to do both of them. And I don't want to choose. And I think 97 00:15:51.860 --> 00:16:03.489 huda: creating that like connection on my story. Building and stuff will definitely like strengthen my application and passion when I am in college. 98 00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:09.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I've been on this. Let me just try my charges. Look like, yeah, go ahead. 99 00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:38.839 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, Janice. I think she's just running for her charger. I I can give you real time feedback here that this this is great. Yeah. Sorry I could not send it, because it was my mistake. I think she had basically done it. I you know, I had back to back meetings. But I didn't want 100 00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.560 Ivy Mentors: yeah. 101 00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.749 Ivy Mentors: this is amazing. 102 00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:52.109 Ivy Mentors: I I I definitely feel that had I given you this information as we do, right? So typically like, you know, you could have actually done a more a listed thing. 103 00:16:52.150 --> 00:17:05.360 Ivy Mentors: And because I've been involved in the sessions with Janice as well I can. I can clearly see right. You know, some of the things I think there are a lot of commonalities, but also a lot of nuances that you're bringing. I think the questions you are asking 104 00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:12.180 Ivy Mentors: so feel free about. You know the next session. I think that was more to give you a feel of how we typically run this 105 00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:26.249 Jenny Duan: and formalize it. Okay, I'm going to go in the background. Sorry. 106 00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:38.660 huda: Oh, I didn't really have anything to say, but I did like the connection between Cs like my game making caching. and then your production. 107 00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:54.530 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah, I think this is a really impactful angle that we can take your application forwards because it seems like right now, you have these 2 sides of your identity that you're having trouble connecting and moving forward. So you feel like, I don't know if you feel this way. But 108 00:17:54.530 --> 00:18:18.099 Jenny Duan: I know when I was doing my application, I felt like, you know, I could only present this one side of myself or schools. My only want to see this one side and not the other, and I had trouble like finding out which side to present, and I was eventually able to combine them together, which is what I hope that we can do together. But yeah, I'd love to hear some more of your thoughts on this. 109 00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:41.190 Ivy Mentors: So I do have a question right? So as I. As I said, you know, she's already actually working with the Mentor, and also, you know, from Iv mentors. And she was, see a student. And one of the reasons that we chose that mentor was primarily because of the major things. And and and you asked a very, very important question that got my engine. I'm I'm a Cs a background person as well 110 00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:53.609 Ivy Mentors: you, you said basically that you, you really try to understand who does real goal and thing that she love, which is really developing and bring bringing things to life. 111 00:18:53.740 --> 00:19:06.540 Ivy Mentors: And but definitely, I had the perception. She has a perception, and I would say, like 99% of the people that I know have this perception that oh, cs, anonymous sorry synonymous with development. 112 00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.569 Ivy Mentors: right? And and and you brought this up 113 00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:25.660 Ivy Mentors: so similarly. so thanks a lot for that. I think that really caught, and I would love to understand a bit more on. How do you prepare for that kind of a journey? because it's always been the way we have thought about it and strategize. This is, One of the reasons why the also wants to go through the humanities 114 00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:37.910 Ivy Mentors: is fundamentally like, you know, it's less competitive. So let's try the humanity angle. But we never thought about any other alternative which is like not really humanity. And I think you've opened up that doors might be there something to think about it. 115 00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:56.139 Ivy Mentors: The second thing is in terms of just a passion project, and with a very similar thinking, and I'm glad that we've got a a a validation from you as well that with that combining video and and gaming. And Cs was kind of a a good way to create a passion project. 116 00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:18.260 Ivy Mentors: And this just happened a few weeks ago to be honest, right? She was always developing game, but she was always going into this kind of and and thanks to her dad as well, coming from that tech background like, Hey to go go deep into AI machine learning, you know, try to do crack something very deep. But then it turned out that it's really not about her expertise, and it's more so about her passion, and we were able to course correct. 117 00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:33.689 Ivy Mentors: However, one thing that fellow parent yesterday that I spoke to was actually has a daughter. he's a Columbia grad as well. When I shared my as as a parent to parent conversation, I told about the Passion project that I was following. 118 00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.070 Ivy Mentors: He basically told me that his feedback was all this is good. 119 00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:44.270 Ivy Mentors: but he doesn't see a connection of how it's actually having an impact or making a community impact. 120 00:20:44.370 --> 00:21:14.109 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is this is what I wanted to talk about next, because, looking at your extracurricular profile, it's very strong. But I think that your miss, what the component that you're missing is this element of community service and having an impact in that way because colleges, a lot of them are looking for measurable impact. And what that looks like is the number of people you can serve. The number of hours your team puts in the the scale of your network. And a lot of really strong applicants have 121 00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:29.280 Jenny Duan: this type of background. So doing, some type of community or advocacy work with whatever their passions are. And I think that we can find an intersection of community service Cs and film somewhere in this middle ground. And I think that this is the 122 00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:40.800 Jenny Duan: key element, one of the key elements that you're missing in your application. So I think we should brainstorm a bit about how we can create a plan to move forward to create this community service element. 123 00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:57.869 huda: yeah. So I was actually thinking of starting a Youtube channel. So my community. It's kind of small. I mean, it's big, but we're tight in it and cause we're kind of far away from the 124 00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:06.389 huda: target. And like all those things. So we have lots of small businesses there. and I think it's a good opportunity. So I was thinking of 125 00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:25.969 huda: go into these small businesses and asking if I could just fill the video and like advertising them, and to build their business and then that way it would be we'd be able to present like a community impact and show that we were able to help this many small businesses and etc., 126 00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:33.140 Jenny Duan: got it. But my question for you is, how do you see this scaling over the next 2 years? Or really, just one year? 127 00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.420 huda: maybe like. 128 00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:51.550 huda: because there's a lot of small businesses. So if you're able to do like many, or we'd be able to advertise them like on Youtube publicly, so that we get lots of traction maybe if 129 00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:59.400 huda: they were able to like become viral, then that's something that could definitely scale larger throughout time. 130 00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:13.850 Jenny Duan: All right. Yeah, I think that this is something that it's a great idea, and I think it's something we should keep in the back of our minds, but also think that we're looking for something that can have a big national or international impact. And 131 00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:28.199 Jenny Duan: I'm thinking maybe you should do this. But I think, what if you created a network of other students who are sharing small business stories in their own communities. And that way we can expand the scale. So it's not just yourself, but it's having an impact on 132 00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:49.460 Jenny Duan: not only your community, but communities all around the country by building this network of people who are sharing and the project that I just came up with in my head is called small business stories. But obviously, you can change whatever tagline you want to do. for that cause. But do you see this distinction between having a local community impact versus being able to expand it to a national thing? 133 00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.489 huda: yeah. So like in this, would we? 134 00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:11.669 huda: How do we like to spend it? Because if, say, our asks like in a different state, or whatever And she shows like small businesses stories when we like film it and post on Youtube or 135 00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:22.010 huda: or would she be like a filmmaker? And then she could zoom, and we could just have people from around the world making these videos. 136 00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:40.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So there's a couple of ways I see that can do this. So the first the first option is a Youtube channel. And you can create playlist for the different cities, or perhaps the different states that you're making videos for. And the second option is to create a website. Do you have any experience in web development? 137 00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:48.169 huda: Yeah, I've made several websites in the past, and I made one for my community, actually for 138 00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:59.549 huda: because there was a job loss, happening. And During that time we made like a website. And we tried to help people with their job. Us. 139 00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:29.269 Jenny Duan: yeah, so I think this is a really great idea and option to combine your passion for computer science, but also your passion for film. So what if you created a website? And the interface could be like a map or some type of map feature? And then in every single city you could have, like a collection of videos that other people are making demonstrating the small businesses in their area. So it'd be kind of like a small business locator or a small business network where you tell the stories of the businesses in those areas. 140 00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.370 Jenny Duan: What do you think about that? I think that's a really good idea. 141 00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:56.169 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And I think that this is really cool, because once you have the website up, maybe you can have a submission portal and some guidelines for submission. You can say, like, the video is 3 to 5 min long. people. You can give them a set of guidelines like here is how you can shoot the video. Here's how to get resources. And then people can just submit it on their own. And it'll just link to your website, and that would be really cool because 142 00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:13.169 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if you've seen those videos or those maps where it's like a ton of strangers submit letters or content, but I think, being able to see that would be really cool, to have, like a set of maybe like 10 countries represented 20 countries represented, or like 30 States, or something like that. And just see that 143 00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:19.160 huda: you think originally, I can like, go on red it, and try to get people to 144 00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:27.680 huda: It's like, Submit their posts on the website. Like, do you think it's a good idea to reach out in the beginning? 145 00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:37.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So the let's talk about scaling, because this is really important. How do we get this from idea to action? And I think that 146 00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:56.320 Jenny Duan: posting on Reddit is going to be kind of a black box, and that people will not necessarily respond unless they know specifically what you're doing and who you are, because Reddit is this anonymous platform. It's also it can be some dangerous content on there. So I would probably not advice starting out with Reddit. I would probably try to get your story out on social media. And 147 00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:17.080 Jenny Duan: I think starting by making the website and filming a couple of these videos for yourself as example videos. And then once you have that start building a team because you already have experience leading a club in the Vfx Club, I would try to get a couple of people to work with you and eventually bring this to nonprofit status, which means Get it registered as a 148 00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:31.109 Jenny Duan: 50351 nonprofit, and we can talk about how to do that in the future. But I think, starting out building some type of organization club where you're in a leadership position. And you're able to have other people helping you. 149 00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:57.050 Jenny Duan: make the videos edit the videos and things like that that way. You're not doing it all on your own, because it is quite kind of a large project, especially at scale. And then a way that you can advertise this is, are you familiar with slack discord? Geneva messaging channels? Yeah, I would try to get the word out on college specific channels. And we can talk about. You know what specific channels to target, but getting the word out there. So I think, first 150 00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.979 Jenny Duan: starting your project. So making 151 00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:08.329 Jenny Duan: sort of a document, talking about exactly what you want to achieve with the project, some measurable goals as well as you trying to start working on your website and 152 00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:20.830 Jenny Duan: well, at the same time getting the word out about your project. So that would include making a couple of videos, perhaps starting a social media account to promote your page and then blasting it in those slack discord, Geneva channels. So 153 00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:33.349 Jenny Duan: I know that's a lot. But let's walk through the steps one by one. So first create at least one video, because you want to have a demo or some type of example to show the other people who will be creating their videos. 154 00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.429 Jenny Duan: does that make sense. Yeah. So that's step one, create the first video 155 00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.910 Jenny Duan: step 2, 156 00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:49.970 Jenny Duan: another act. The second action item is to start working on and designing the website. So you said, you have experience designing and building websites. Right? 157 00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.699 Jenny Duan: So step 2 158 00:28:51.720 --> 00:29:05.260 Jenny Duan: is to think about the website, what kind of features you want on the website and start building that I'd imagine the website will be one of the more time consuming spots in this whole activity flow so that will take up a little bit more time. 159 00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:30.520 Jenny Duan: So you want to start it early. So that's step 2. And then the third step is to start a social media page and start promoting your content. And people love stories. You're a natural storyteller. You're, you know, a coder. You make videos. You're good at telling stories. This is what you do. So try to get your story out on social media blast. In those Whatsapp channels on Instagram, on Facebook, you can create a page. You know. 160 00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:53.780 Jenny Duan: Instagram Handle. Whatever your project is called, you pick the name and then say, Introduce yourself, be like, Hi, I'm Huda. I'm making this. I'm doing this video project talking about small businesses in the community and try to grow your Instagram following that way. People are organically looking at your content. And they're thinking about it. So so that way, when you have a call to action, so step 3 social media channels. 161 00:29:53.780 --> 00:30:06.000 Jenny Duan: Step 4 will be to finish everything on your website and start your call to action. When I say, call to action. That's the actual ask of getting people to submit their videos to you. And 162 00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:30.060 Jenny Duan: again, you can do this on social media. Hopefully, you'll have a small following by this time, like on your social media, you can show like behind the scenes you're filming, you editing the website, your whole entire process. And hopefully, people will feel inspired enough to start creating their own content. And so that fourth step. So 1, 2, 3, 4 is the call to action, and where people are uploading their videos. And once you do that sort of in the background while you're doing all these 4 steps. 163 00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:37.849 Jenny Duan: If you feel like you need extra help. That's reaching out to people editing the videos making the website, you can start building a team with you as a leader. 164 00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:47.049 huda: Does that sort of process make sense? Yeah, for sure. And then this is like really specific information. I really like it. yeah. 165 00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.280 huda: so 166 00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.629 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's really a good idea. Thank you. 167 00:30:51.750 --> 00:31:01.519 Ivy Mentors: Hi, again, thanks a lot. Jenny. I think this is really very, very helpful. And this is like more like You know, as the dad here. 168 00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:16.029 Ivy Mentors: you know, one of the things that I'm seeing who that kind of struggle with like, I am super confident, about her skills in terms of both creativity. And and you know, analytical skills of development and problem solving with Cs 169 00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:31.360 Ivy Mentors: the challenges again, like going back to last point on her kind of style. She's a very kind of reserve, and very different than you know probably her dad and also her sister, like older sister, is like more 170 00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.629 Ivy Mentors: you know, outgoing, and who dies more like an inter work right? 171 00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.319 Ivy Mentors: And so there are certain things that we discuss at home as well. 172 00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:58.080 Ivy Mentors: and and she develops a lot of amazing things. But one of the barriers that that has, I would say, as a that at least I feel like she's pretty much within her kind of well, right like her own world. She's sometimes like I look at her product that she's developing. It amazes me. And even like the other mentor 173 00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.249 Ivy Mentors: she's amazed with it as well. 174 00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.790 Ivy Mentors: The problem, however, is 175 00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.829 Ivy Mentors: like video as an example. 176 00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:28.249 Ivy Mentors: like Huda, something's holding her back. I I think there is a a different aspect of this right that she has this video. She has created this amazing thing. But she's really shy to go out there while you don't have. She has a younger brother who's 7 year old. But I'm not fair, but he's very much like an outgoing guy, and he has, like 1,000 of followers already in Youtube. He's an animator. 177 00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:43.449 Ivy Mentors: So I think there is something that's holding our back. And I would love to also that. And and I would love, you know, because, Jenny is your mentor here, I would love to also share your struggle like, just go a bit slow on. These are the execution step. But what are the some of the challenges and barriers that you have? 178 00:32:43.650 --> 00:33:02.680 Ivy Mentors: Right? That you've started a Youtube channel. But you're not able to, you know, come out more strongly. And even like you'd be. you know you have this team. I I I you know I'm seeing that you're not able to not because of your lack of skills or abilities. But I feel there's something lagging there. You wanna get some advice on that. Sorry. 179 00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:11.960 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah. I think that one thing that I talk about that, I think, is really important is you don't. 180 00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:21.530 Jenny Duan: The point is not just to do a bunch of things and get into a good school because you're obviously smart. You're capable, and you know that you can get into a good school. 181 00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:37.570 Jenny Duan: if you put effort in. But the point is to become the type of person that would go to the type of school that you're looking for. And so I'm wondering, like within yourself, what do you feel like? Is holding you back from getting to that next level? 182 00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:47.979 Jenny Duan: Do you think it's a component of your extra particulars. Do you think that it's you know your confidence? What do you think? Are you able to identify the aspects of yourself that you feel like? 183 00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.619 Jenny Duan: you would want to work on. 184 00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.150 huda: Yeah, so definitely, 185 00:33:54.510 --> 00:34:18.060 huda: my dad knows this. But it's not. It's like kind of drive is kind of my issue, and a lot of the time. If I'm given like what I'm supposed supposed to be doing, I'll do it, and like I'll do it well. But I just it's hard to find like opportunities. For example, I started a Youtube channel like 2 days ago, and I posted a video and 186 00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:30.090 huda: well, like, I guess I can't really find like ideas to post and kind of like creator like filmmakers block kind of. And 187 00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.169 huda: I just don't know what to do most of the time. 188 00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.910 huda: And yeah, so I think that's like my main issue. But other than that, like. 189 00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:52.720 huda: I think being quiet is one of my biggest disadvantages because it's hard to collaborate with students at school since a lot of time. I'll be quiet, and I don't really talk to that. Many people. And 190 00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.669 huda: it's hard to find like people to collaborate. For example, on this project. 191 00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:14.029 huda: with the community. small businesses project. I think it might be hard finding a team here in Mount House where I live. And I think it might be tough, because there's not that many driven people at my school and 192 00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.129 huda: I don't talk to many people, and I think that might be a big issue. 193 00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.600 Jenny Duan: Totally. Yeah. 194 00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:29.589 Jenny Duan: So you said that you've done, or I think your dad's mentioned that you've done a couple of hackathons in the past. 195 00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:36.280 Jenny Duan: What any of your hackathon teammates be interested in collaborating with you again on maybe developing the website and being on this team. 196 00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:51.420 huda: Yeah, for sure, I think a lot of my Hackathon teammates were online. And they were like, college students. So maybe I could ask them for help, since they probably know more. and yeah. 197 00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.289 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then another thing that we can do is to have Linkedin. 198 00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:56.320 huda: Yeah. 199 00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:22.589 Jenny Duan: you should. You can advertise on Linkedin. I think it's one of the greatest ways to reach other like pre-professional or students, you want to make an impact. And so maybe if you bake a Linkedin post that's like a call to action calling people to join your team, offer a leadership position. They can be like, maybe head of marketing, or whatever positions you think you would need support with. I think people will be willing to support if you do an online call to action, too. 200 00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.740 huda: Yeah. 201 00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.450 Jenny Duan: awesome. Go ahead. 202 00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.029 huda: No, that's that's oh. 203 00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:34.750 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then I think I want to challenge you to one thing. 204 00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:40.709 Jenny Duan: But before we go into that challenge, I'm curious if you can walk me through what a day in your life looks like? 205 00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.850 Jenny Duan: Obviously. So it's a bit different. 206 00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:52.119 huda: So during the summer wait, do you want me to describe a summer day, or like a school day. Let's do go. 207 00:36:52.300 --> 00:37:07.669 huda: Okay. So for summer, usually I wake up. I And then I start. I kind of like rest, for, like the first few hours of the day, and then then I'll start working on my video game. 208 00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:09.250 huda: and after that. 209 00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:35.569 huda: like after I make like an accomplishment, for example, like a segment of the game. maybe I'll start practicing for the sat since I'm taking in October. So I'd like just some messy practice and it's kind of laid back at the moment, because there's not. I don't know exactly what to do, but I've been trying to do some research. But yes, kind of it. 210 00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:41.280 huda: And then for during the school week I probably 211 00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.850 huda: wake up, go to school and then come back and then 212 00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.210 get started on my homework. 213 00:37:48.550 --> 00:38:01.010 huda: honestly, with, last year I didn't really work on anything extracurricular, I mean, I did work on on like clubs and whatnot. But 214 00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.680 huda: I was pretty much about it. 215 00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:12.799 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. I think that one thing that we can work on together is building a structure to your days, both in the summer and in school, because 216 00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:37.089 Jenny Duan: I know that this is a really challenging thing for many students to figure out how they utilize their time. But I think building a structure to that. You know. Figure out how much time you're going to spend studying how much time you're going to spend working on your projects. Extracurriculars planning ahead can be a really useful way to not only improve your confidence in yourself, but also make time to build all of these exciting projects that we've talked about together. 217 00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.050 Jenny Duan: what do you think about that? 218 00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:48.840 huda: Yeah, definitely, that could be really helpful, because I am missing loss of structure. And yeah, I'll definitely help you get a lot more done. 219 00:38:49.210 --> 00:39:15.890 Jenny Duan: All right. So I'll put a bookmark in that, and we can come back to do that maybe later in the session or another time if we run out of time. But I think now let's do a deep dive into your extracurriculars, because I think that was what we wanted to talk about today. and I'm curious about what you feel, how you feel about journalism, because I know that we've talked about storytelling both with code, with film. And I'm wondering 220 00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:30.560 Jenny Duan: how you how you feel about journalism versus film, because those are 2 pretty similar, but different subject groups or academic majors that you can apply for like journalism versus film. And are you familiar with the difference. And have you thought about it at all? 221 00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:39.030 huda: I haven't really thought about journalism, this is more like a literary thing, I believe and 222 00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:45.639 huda: I know. That's like, Get you jobs that like newspapers and articles and magazines. 223 00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:58.230 huda: whereas I'm kind of a visual storyteller, and I like to tell my stories to Previously, I've done video games, short films, music, videos, I and if we like 224 00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.659 huda: to showing things 225 00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.429 huda: visually. But I do think writing is something that I do enjoy. But 226 00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.929 huda: I I enjoy from making a lot more. 227 00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:25.040 Jenny Duan: I'm asking, because I know within journalism there's a niche for like photo journalism and video journalism like video essays. that are really popular now. And another thing is also data visualization. I don't know if you've looked into this at all. are you familiar with that? 228 00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.649 huda: I think it's a branch of like, 229 00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.389 huda: AI and machine learning right? 230 00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:58.309 Jenny Duan: Yeah, kind of. So it's, how do? How do we draw graphs and identify patterns through data? For example, data journalism was really important during the pandemic, when the New York Times is releasing graphs about like you know how many people were infected in a certain area, or how fast infections were spreading. So I'm not sure how interested you are in data. But I know that this is another way. We can maybe combine storytelling and computer science in another way. 231 00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.900 Jenny Duan: I bring this up also because Stanford has a major called data science and social systems. 232 00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:33.160 Jenny Duan: which is about how we apply data science to address different things like small businesses like small businesses, not having enough business, or like public health, epidemics, and other things. So I think that could be a really interesting intersection, especially since earlier you mentioned. You're taking? you, your, your school has economics. And was it public policy? I forget what? The other class? political science, yeah, economics and political science, so that could be something that you can talk about and explore. 233 00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.220 Jenny Duan: And 234 00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:45.380 Jenny Duan: so I also bring that up, because, as we're looking towards next summer and working on your extracurriculars. some of our programs are a big part of that. And there are a lot of 235 00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:52.019 Jenny Duan: journalism summer program set. You might want to consider applying for in case that in case you're interested in 236 00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:56.310 Jenny Duan: more of that visual storytelling aspect of journalism. 237 00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:21.069 Jenny Duan: yeah. And going back to summer summers, especially this summer and next summer, are really really important times to have a story about what you're doing or how you spend your time. Because Stanford, specifically, I know, has a question on their application that asks, how did you spend your past 2 summers? So you want to be able to in just one or 2 sentences have a clear idea about what you're doing this summer and next summer. 238 00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:41.260 Jenny Duan: So because that starts this summer, I think that just highlights. How important it is to maybe start your projects. Whether that's the Youtube channel, the the small business idea or something different. If you decide that you don't want to do either of those things, starting it this summer, because Stanford will ask you about that. What you're doing this summer on their application 2 years later. 239 00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:49.750 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, so sorry to interrupt here. I think it's a it's a very critical point, and it makes me quite anxious and nervous as a dad as well. 240 00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.779 Ivy Mentors: clearly, you know. 241 00:42:53.260 --> 00:43:05.229 Ivy Mentors: I I'm not as educated in into the process of thanks. A lot of sharing the whole reasoning behind. Why you are asking this question as well, and you kind of trying to map it to the college admission process that really helps 242 00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:16.249 Ivy Mentors: so one of the things I definitely know, like many of the parents, that summers are important, and there are a bunch of options that we are thrown with right. And I had my like older daughter. 243 00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.360 Ivy Mentors: you know. 244 00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:45.120 Ivy Mentors: we have basically made our join like so many programs and summer sessions, including the one in Stanford as well, and we that those things were not as impactful. It didn't really help much, and this time for that I didn't want to do that. So in terms of this particular summer the whole idea was to really help her work with these. you know, Iv mentors. And you know, doing this. This was the main goal that I I started this engagement with, I, we mentors. And 245 00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:58.009 Ivy Mentors: the other Mito, basically, you know, did a very similar kind of a thorough assessment. And one of the things that came out was really to build start building a passion project. However, one of the that the point of view that you know she had basically was 246 00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:13.610 Ivy Mentors: to work, you know, towards a competitive program like Launch X. So the whole story was, okay. You know you don't have to do 100 things. But let's just build something very concrete and and that's the engagement the sugar is in with that particular mentor 247 00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:22.550 Ivy Mentors: and the planning and and the brainstorming and the strategization at the project that she's working on actually came out of that But 248 00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:36.129 Ivy Mentors: so I think this is where and and it's very interesting, because the thing that was also missing and concerning me from that was like, we're probably putting all our eggs in one basket, right? And saying that, okay, let's just focus on a competitive program, because that's your ticket to Iv. 249 00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:49.999 Ivy Mentors: now, you basically opened up you know, various aspects here. because the impact to the community. And this came not from me, but actually another dad who basically told me when you look at it, I'm glad that you basically had a similar kind of feedback. 250 00:44:50.160 --> 00:45:09.330 Ivy Mentors: So it looks like the project is much beyond the game that was making the project is actually much beyond right. It's got all the social element. It's got the awareness. And and I think this is kind of an an interesting thing, because kids and the parents don't get it for us like project, is there something unique that we have developed? 251 00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:15.239 Ivy Mentors: And If you don't show that community impact. That's not really a project, right? If I'm understanding it correct. 252 00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:20.169 Ivy Mentors: So I think, what are your thoughts on that now, and I would love to 253 00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.440 Ivy Mentors: understand. How do we now pivot 254 00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:30.740 Ivy Mentors: or leverage the same assets? And we can the really start also prioritizing our time and effort. 255 00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:46.660 Ivy Mentors: even though we are towards the end of the summer. But she spent a lot of time on building this project. So I think the other mentor, basically, was quite amazed. And she the Cs mentor, because I know that who does a good developer and coder she that she's made great progress in terms of just developing a very unique asset. 256 00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.050 Ivy Mentors: But that's a technology asset. 257 00:45:49.550 --> 00:46:04.919 Jenny Duan: But how do we really take it from here? you know? Sorry to to just like, bring up my anxiety as well. Yeah, I know as a parent it's totally understandable to be concerned about your kid, because you want the best for your future and for their future. And 258 00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:31.509 Jenny Duan: obviously they want the best for themselves, too. So totally understand where you're coming from. And I think to really answer this question. Huda, we can think about the perspective of a college admissions officer like, why do they want you to go to their school. It's because you have something to offer. It's because you can make an impact on the world. That's the really, the purpose of college is to empower young people to have impactful careers and leave impactful legacies. 259 00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:35.610 Jenny Duan: And this whole thing centers on. How are you going to make? 260 00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:56.250 Jenny Duan: How are you going to change the world in some way, and who know you're going to change the world, I can tell you that. But how are you going to do it right? And that's what these colleges are looking for. How can we, you know, bring these passionate, driven, smart young people into our school and make them something greater, and how you specifically going to do that. So that's why, when we consider this, what they're looking for is 261 00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:03.419 Jenny Duan: your pathway of impact so far. And they're trying to use that to make a guess about how you're going to make impact in the future. 262 00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:22.679 Jenny Duan: And that's why community service and that element is so important, not just, you know, to have a certain number of hours on the table, but really to make a difference through your work. And if you really like games. I think that we can pick actually for you one cause that you're well, that you're passionate about supporting. I think 263 00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:33.439 Jenny Duan: everyone has something like some cause that they're passionate about supporting. So let's identify yours. For example, for me some my application. I focus a lot on 264 00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:57.479 Jenny Duan: mental health advocacy and Asian American Pacific Islander advocacy, and like women in stem. So those were like 3 things that I was passionate about. My application was heavily centered around my advocacy, so most people don't need to have 3 things. That's just some of the things that I was passionate about. Obviously it's different for everyone. But is there in your brain one social cause that you're passionate about. If not, we can brainstorm some together. 265 00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:06.630 huda: Yeah, definitely. So I think I'm kind of passionate about women in stem, because I have face like the struggles. 266 00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:19.650 huda: totally, actually, even in my own school. And I think that's just feeling it. And in person has definitely like bought me to like want to advocate for them. 267 00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.520 huda: and I think 268 00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:32.880 huda: that's like my main advocacy. But 269 00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:47.249 huda: I guess, also advocating, for, like people who are quieter because I know, like my entire life, I've kind of been like a bit quiet, so it has definitely affected me. So maybe that's something that I can advocate for. 270 00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:58.130 Jenny Duan: yeah, I have a great and I have an idea for you. But first I want to hear about this game that you created. Can you tell me a bit about it? 271 00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:22.029 huda: Yeah. So basically. it's a view game like an rpg, where this? It's kind of storytelling game, where basically, there's this middle Schooler girl, and she has to an older sister who knows a lot about machine learning, but she doesn't know anything yet. And basically her town runs on this AI robot 272 00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:34.140 huda: and most of the things are generated by the AI and everything like that. But then One day it just goes rogue, and then it goes like And then it starts doing all these crazy things like 273 00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:53.269 huda: like messing up the research lab or the trees start like turning into different objects. And then the object of the game is to basically find the AI, and then, while you're while you're like looking for the AI you learn different things about it like. 274 00:49:53.270 --> 00:50:19.200 huda: Oh, this is a this is a classification model. And AI and yeah, like, you learn different parts of AI, and then at the end, there's going to be like kind of like a boss fight where you have to. D. Why, the robot, using all these things that you know about AI like Oh, we should use classification model for this. And you should use this model for that 275 00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.019 huda: in. Yeah. 276 00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:34.129 huda: this is amazing, amazing. Can I see the game? Do you have a link to it. it's not fully developed yet, but and I haven't released it. But some of the makes and I I do have like clips of they can play, though 277 00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:39.420 Jenny Duan: this is amazing. Have you heard about the concept of AI ethics or AI bias? 278 00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.610 huda: I've heard of a bias for? Yeah. 279 00:50:43.950 --> 00:51:11.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that this, no, this is perfect. I why didn't you tell me about this earlier? This is amazing. I think we can really frame this game, to connect your passion for women in stem and social advocacy by framing it as a game that empowers young female coders to learn about the ethical and social impacts of AI, because this is a huge issue on people's minds, especially within big tech. Within these schools, who 280 00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:22.549 Jenny Duan: are especially Stanford. I know, because I go there. They're huge on AI ethics, AI bias. And they're actively developing programs to support people who are passionate about this. So 281 00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:48.099 Jenny Duan: another strategy that we can use in looking at colleges is seeing what types of programs they're supporting and how much they're funding these programs, because that gives you a glimpse about. You know whether or not they want more people in these programs, whether or not they want less. And I know at Stanford personally, they are funding a lot of AI Ethics departments, the data science and social systems major is brand new. They have a lot of money in that program, which means they're recruiting students for that program. And they really want people to be in that program. 282 00:51:48.580 --> 00:52:07.950 Jenny Duan: So this is where you you come in, I think, talk, framing the scheme as a way to talk about AI education. AI bias, female empowerment and stem is really really powerful, and I want you to win an award for this. So one thing I'm thinking about is One specific thing that you should apply for is 283 00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:16.209 Jenny Duan: Ncw, it. Have you heard about this program. no. I'm gonna send it in the oh, I'm gonna send it to you in the chat. 284 00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:29.050 Jenny Duan: And this is a network of women in Technology National Center for Women and Information Technology, and they offer an award called the Aspirations and Computing award. And 285 00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:51.469 Jenny Duan: I want to help you win this award. This is both a national award. So it's a national award. But they also have levels at the regional and state level, which means that you have plenty of opportunities to win, and I was in a I was a recipient of this award in high school, and it's I think it's really a great program for you to 286 00:52:51.840 --> 00:53:13.130 Jenny Duan: gain some recognition for the game that you've been developing, as well as for your passion in techn for technology. And when applications come out in the fall. I've won this award twice, so I've won the National Honorable mentioned, and also the State winner. Twice you can apply for multiple times. So I'm pretty familiar with how this works, and I'd love to help you apply for this specific award. 287 00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:16.040 Another thing that I think you can 288 00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.279 Jenny Duan: you should think about is, have you? Are you involved with Hat Club at all? 289 00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.979 huda: I don't think they have that at our school. 290 00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:31.680 Jenny Duan: Okay, that club is a national organization. let me just send it to you, and they run hackathons that are 291 00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:34.099 Jenny Duan: free to participate in, and 292 00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:43.590 Jenny Duan: they give awards for every single hackathon. So this is something that you should do, because you said you've already participated at Hackathon in the past. Right? 293 00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.280 huda: Yeah. 294 00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:48.090 Jenny Duan: Have you won any awards at hackathons? 295 00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:55.410 huda: I've got an honorable mention from like a couple in a place. Top 5 and some. Yeah. 296 00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:59.209 Jenny Duan: that's amazing. I think you should register for Hat Club, because I think it's 297 00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:21.980 Jenny Duan: literally the number one best community for young people interested in coding right now. My sister is in Vermont at a Hat Club conference, and they flew her out to participate in that hackathon. They have this every single summer. Last summer she was at the I do know what figma is. She's at the Figma headquarters at ha! At a hat club hackathon. So I think you should get involved in a hat club asap. 298 00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:25.519 Jenny Duan: and I also think, have you ever thought about starting your own hackathon? 299 00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:29.169 huda: Yes, I was actually thinking of that. But 300 00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:43.530 huda: They have a hackathon club at our school. And it's kind of it's like really rigged, and it's like a terrible club. But they do like a annual hackathon at the school, so I don't know if I could. 301 00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:47.600 huda: Should I just do it like independently or at the school? 302 00:54:48.190 --> 00:55:08.359 Jenny Duan: I think. What if you said that your Your school is in is a public school, and it's like there's not a lot of big businesses around your school. Is that sort of the area? Yeah, I think, what if you did a virtual hackathon you didn't have, you don't have to do in person. What if you did a virtual one, so that people from all over the world can join. 303 00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.890 huda: Yeah, it's a good idea. I think I could. 304 00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:23.690 Jenny Duan: So on up. Yeah. And you can make this hackathon, you know, you can set the theme for your hackathon. They can be about maybe game development. It could be a game development hackathon, but I think what would be really powerful is, if you did 305 00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:33.410 Jenny Duan: like a tech ethics hackathon like an like a AI ethics or AI hackathon, and if you made it all women, I think that would be really powerful 306 00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:59.060 Jenny Duan: sure. And then, we can build this hackathon together. I can help bring in mentors and help you with that. But what looks like at a hackathon is. It's about one day or a weekend, I mean, you've done it. So you know of coding, but you can also have speakers come in and since I go to school in the barrier, and your dad is also involved in tech. I'm sure we can bring in some really cool women speakers to come and talk about their jobs, their roles. We can bring in speakers. 307 00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:27.590 Jenny Duan: You can host workshop sessions that you could teach people how you develop a game. How you develop a game, you know, have different mentorship and also workshop sessions during your hackathon. So hosting a virtual hackathon could also be a really, really fun thing to do. And if you're concerned about, you know the club being rigged, I know how club culture works, I know, like extremely frustrating. So having a virtual means that anyone can join. So you're not limited to your geographic area, especially with it being a smaller area. 308 00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.730 Jenny Duan: I would think so much. Yeah, I would look into that. 309 00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:48.590 Jenny Duan: And then I think that the one something else that we wanted to talk a little bit about was your passion for film, and I know one of the original reasons why I'm having this conversation with you, in the first place, is to look at what kinds of film festivals or programs you can apply for right 310 00:56:49.900 --> 00:57:00.340 Jenny Duan: right so i'm going to give you a couple ideas right now and we're going to talk about them together. So does your school have a National History day 311 00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:05.080 Jenny Duan: club or an Nhd. Organization. I'm putting the links in the chat as I speak. 312 00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.569 huda: no, I don't think so. 313 00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:25.790 Jenny Duan: Okay, so I think this is one thing that you can think about doing. It's called national History Date. And what you're doing is you're making documentary film. So one of the one of the categories is film. So you're making a short documentary film about a historical story or a 314 00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:30.509 Jenny Duan: something in history that was impactful. So 315 00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:34.849 Jenny Duan: are you interested in history at all? If not, we can move on. But 316 00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:38.110 Jenny Duan: it is pretty fascinating. Yeah. 317 00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 318 00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:55.370 Jenny Duan: I think one of the things that I have a friend who won the national competition a couple of years ago, and the video that he made was about this battle at over, like native American tribal land in Oregon, and it was something that people don't really talk about, and was pretty like 319 00:57:55.370 --> 00:58:07.019 Jenny Duan: under represented in historian and media. So one thing that I'm thinking that you can maybe make a video about is a short documentary about like women in stem in some regard 320 00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:30.250 Jenny Duan: like, have you seen hidden figures? That's like about the story of the NASA astronauts. But what if you found something similar that you can talk about within computer science, like a famous computer science female role model that you know people don't talk about. And you can make a video about her story and submit it for national history day. I think that would be super super cool. And this is something that you can do throughout the school year. 321 00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:35.810 Jenny Duan: And you can create this video. But I'm pretty sure this 322 00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:43.739 Jenny Duan: you you would have to talk to a teacher to have them organize like a club or a 323 00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:51.299 Jenny Duan: affiliation. So that you're able to. So you're able to enter. So actually, right now, I'm gonna look up your local contest. 324 00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:54.380 Jenny Duan: okay. 325 00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.119 Jenny Duan: I'm going to 326 00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:11.450 Jenny Duan: send you some information about the affiliate coordinator. So to get started on national history day. And I'm sorry I don't have access to the dog. I don't have editing access to the document, but I can just put it in the chat again. 327 00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:17.220 Jenny Duan: so let me just request that access? 328 00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:25.429 Jenny Duan: one specific thing that you can do if you are interested in national history, day is to reach out to 329 00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.590 Jenny Duan: these people. 330 00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:33.090 Jenny Duan: give me 1 s to put their information in the chat. 331 00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:42.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think I just got 332 00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:46.480 Jenny Duan: let me just put that in the chat. 333 00:59:49.830 --> 01:00:08.949 Jenny Duan: So this is the the thing I just put in the document is the information for the local contest director. So it's a scrollable map, and you can go to California, which is the state you're in, and in the Sacramento Bay area there's 2 people, Craig, Irish, and Whitney Olsen, and right after we do this call. 334 01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:17.340 Jenny Duan: we should, you should send them an email asking how you can get involved in California with this competition if you're interested in pursuing this. 335 01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:22.550 Jenny Duan: And I think you should email them. Even if you're not just so, you can learn more about the program. 336 01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:42.110 Jenny Duan: And then another thing that I want you to look into is young arts. And this is a specific film competition. It's a national competition. If you win, you get to have your art displayed in the Us. Capital. So that's really exciting. You can have your film displayed there. It's called A Young Arts and 337 01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:55.139 Jenny Duan: it's in artistic competition that I've just at you the film, the film contest. But you can submit for narrative, documentary, experimental and animation filmmaking. 338 01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:57.290 Jenny Duan: So actually. 339 01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:15.279 Jenny Duan: right after this call, I'm going to make a to do list of like action items after this call. But on the action items list is going to be to sign up for the 2024 young Arts application update. So it's for people in grades 10 to 12. So age 15 to 18, so perfect for you and 340 01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:20.940 Jenny Duan: you can submit a film or documentary to young arts. So 341 01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:23.589 huda: yeah, that's nice. 342 01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:28.840 huda: do you think this competition is competitive? 343 01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:33.839 Jenny Duan: It is definitely competitive. but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't apply 344 01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:53.260 Jenny Duan: because the young arts winners. They also are eligible for presidential scholars in the arts awards, which is a really big accomplishment. So I think that you know, just because something is competitive that shouldn't dissuade you from applying. Obviously, some things are going to be more competitive. Some things that we talk about might be easier to get into. But 345 01:01:53.450 --> 01:02:11.699 Jenny Duan: I think that if you hone your craft and you apply, you have a really good shot of making it, and you shouldn't limit yourself by saying, Oh, is competitive. I shouldn't apply. No, you are capable. You're talented, and you should apply. And the worst case, the worst thing that happens is you try again next year, and that's not that bad, or you apply for something different. 346 01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:30.050 Jenny Duan: So I think one strategy that we're using right now is applying to as many things as possible, because if you apply for more things, and you can probably submit the same content for these different competitions as well. You have a greater chance of winning at least one of them. So that's a strategy that we can talk about. 347 01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.310 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 348 01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:38.659 Jenny Duan: okay, great. And then 349 01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:51.559 Jenny Duan: another thing that you can apply for is Now we're getting into a different category, which I think this is another niche you can really work on. It's science communication. Have you ever heard about this? 350 01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:55.710 Jenny Duan: strategy at all? Science communication? 351 01:02:55.970 --> 01:03:22.229 Jenny Duan: So science communication is like making videos that explain science concepts to young younger audiences, or taking, be able to take a complex idea like what you did in your game and turn it into something that anyone can understand. And there's a couple of scholarships and competitions that I think we can enter in this in this category. So the first thing is the breakthrough. Junior challenge. Have you heard about this? 352 01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.390 huda: No, I don't think so. 353 01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:28.549 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So this is a 354 01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.510 Jenny Duan: Let me put it in the chat. 355 01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:48.579 Jenny Duan: This is a competition about science communication, and this is a very, very prestigious award. So it's hard to win. But actually, I have a friend at Stanford who won it. And it's open to people worldwide. And you're making a 356 01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:53.649 Jenny Duan: video explaining a concept in like a short amount of time. That's that's it. 357 01:03:53.990 --> 01:04:02.449 Jenny Duan: So let me show you the video of that, my friend, one, it's a 3 min long video. And you're explaining a 358 01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:11.810 Jenny Duan: yeah, a concept in a short amount time. So maybe if I found you this video, we can watch it together. So you can get a sense of what I'm talking about. 359 01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:19.380 Jenny Duan: And if you just want to click the link. You can watch like 10 s of it. You don't have to watch the whole thing. 360 01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:30.549 Jenny Duan: So just you can get a sense, it's it's not a very technical or hard concept. It's about taking something big and making it telling a story from it, making it understandable. 361 01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.450 huda: Yeah. 362 01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.160 Jenny Duan: is it like, strictly like science based? yes, it is. It is 363 01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.520 huda: okay. 364 01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:39.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 365 01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:44.989 Jenny Duan: so are you watching the video? Have you seen it? 366 01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.099 huda: Because it did this show you? 367 01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:56.779 Jenny Duan: it's the one I just put in the chat. 368 01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:02.720 Jenny Duan: It's just like amber, Mauritius physics. Winter 21 breakthrough challenge. 369 01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:13.870 huda: Yeah. Okay? I also added to the document, just you are able to edit the document. Now, right? 370 01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:27.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I am. I can. I should, to add it in the document. Then we'll be able to like, you know. So yeah, perfect. Anyways, this, it's only a 3 min long video. It's about Van der Waals forces. and something of 371 01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:33.969 Jenny Duan: physics related. So you can make one about computer science. And I think that would be really, really powerful. 372 01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:38.760 Jenny Duan: Another thing that I'm going to put in the chat, and this is something that we can hold on 373 01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:43.390 Jenny Duan: to until senior year. But it's called the Science Ambassador, scholarship. 374 01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:45.520 Jenny Duan: and 375 01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:56.199 Jenny Duan: If you win it, you get a full, full ride to college. But again, it's a 3 min video on a science topic. And I think talking about AI would personally be really interesting. 376 01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:07.690 Jenny Duan: So that's another thing. But this for the Science Ambassador scholarship that I just put. We can hold off on that until your senior year, because it's only open to incoming freshmen and college students. So 377 01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:15.329 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's something we can apply for right now. But I'm trying to give you a sense of the opportunities that are available in terms of science communication videos 378 01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.729 huda: yeah, it sounds great. 379 01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:32.379 Jenny Duan: So those are some specific things that you can apply for, have you? I think that a film festival is going to be a little bit difficult, because actually, can you tell me what type of film you're interested in, like, what type of films do you like to make? 380 01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:45.589 huda: So honestly, I just, I kinda like making anything but I'd say, like my main favorite kinds of film is like movies, like short films. 381 01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:51.860 huda: music videos. I made a music video before. And I really enjoyed it. I like 382 01:06:51.880 --> 01:07:00.350 huda: making like, I'm fine. I'm making documentaries, but I'm not that great at it. But I could definitely like work on it. But 383 01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:03.490 huda: yeah, and you anything like? 384 01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:09.559 huda: Sure? Because I feel like editing long videos is not really like my strength. 385 01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:15.680 huda: And of what I think vlogs is also like. pretty interesting to me. 386 01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:28.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's awesome. and I think that one thing you should look into I think you should apply for this program, even if you're not that interested in journalism. 387 01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:37.210 Jenny Duan: So it's called Jcamp. I'm gonna the link is in the document. Do you have access to the document? Or would you prefer to putting things in the chat. 388 01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.650 huda: I have access to it. 389 01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:50.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think you should look at this. It's called the Asian American Journalism Association, and they have a summer program. It's only 6 days long. So it's not going to take up your whole summer. You have the option to do other things with your summer next year. 390 01:07:50.770 --> 01:08:00.470 Jenny Duan: but it's very prestigious and it's a good foundation for people who are interested in storytelling, including visual storytelling. So 391 01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:13.659 Jenny Duan: on the page. It says, select a students demonstrate a keen interest in broadcasting newspaper, magazine, photo journalism or an online media. So I would say that you should definitely apply for this program. And 392 01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:26.510 Jenny Duan: the people who have done this are really, really impactful. for example, like speakers that come are like the co-host of the today show Former publishers of the New York Times. 393 01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:44.569 Jenny Duan: people from Cbs news. And all these big news organizations come. So it's a really good way to explore connecting with those powerful people in the media which you know could be an industry that you're interested in working with and also getting into a prestigious summer program. And the reason why summer programs are important is because. 394 01:08:45.170 --> 01:09:08.439 Jenny Duan: first of all, it's a good practice for applying to college, just because you'll have to write essays and do things for that. But also some of our programs function as an award, when you get into a procedure summer program, that's basically an award that's saying, like, you are qualified enough to do this. So other people might like a college might view you as qualified enough to attend there. does that make sense? 395 01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:19.460 Jenny Duan: So I really want to give you some specific programs to apply for. So first of all, J. Camp is a good one. I know that right now you're considering applying for Launch X. Can you tell me why you're applying for launch X, 396 01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:45.639 huda: yeah. So launch X is kind of like an entrepreneurial experience that they let students go through. And I think just like the concept of being an entrepreneur is like really interesting to me, and I think it's probably something that I want to do in the future, and I think it'll help me work with others, and also like emerge as a leader. 397 01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:52.449 Jenny Duan: Okay, if you want to be a leader, do you have to go to an entrepreneurship summer program to do that? 398 01:09:53.060 --> 01:10:02.390 huda: Well, not exactly. But it it'll definitely like, help me like learn how to become a leader. amongst others in a group. 399 01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:08.059 Jenny Duan: What's the best way to become a leader in your opinion. 400 01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:21.199 huda: I'd say, just kinda have experience. like helping others and leading them to do to help leading them to have accomplishments 401 01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:27.020 Jenny Duan: exactly, I think, to be a leader. You don't need someone to teach you how to be a leader. I think 402 01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:33.299 Jenny Duan: the big, the biggest thing to do. To be a leader is simply just be a one, lead other people. And I think that 403 01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:43.789 Jenny Duan: because the rest of your application is not that focused on entrepreneurship. It doesn't make sense, in my opinion, to spend a lot of time at an entrepreneurship Institute, because 404 01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:50.459 Jenny Duan: this isn't something that you have mentioned elsewhere in your application, and also because you can learn the same skills that you would at launch X 405 01:10:50.480 --> 01:11:11.989 Jenny Duan: in other places. For example, by doing your passion projects by connecting other people by leading your club. I think all this demonstrates your leadership, and you wouldn't necessarily have to like sit in classes to learn how to be a leader. Also, same thing with goes for being an entrepreneur. If you want to be an entrepreneur, you can just be one. I don't think you need to be taught how to be an entrepreneur. If you want to start a business, if you have an idea, then 406 01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:21.990 Jenny Duan: you can just build it, and same thing for collaboration, like, if you want to learn how to work with other people, you can just work with other people, I think, spending Do you know how long launch X is? 407 01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.910 huda: not exactly sure I can. And just look. 408 01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.140 Jenny Duan: let me see. 409 01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:32.100 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 410 01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:47.000 Jenny Duan: And I'm telling you this because this is something that my sister was considering, too. She's your age, too, and We eventually decided that this probably wasn't going to be a good fit for her. and I think you fall under a similar background, because. 411 01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:56.410 Jenny Duan: again, like, if you want to be an entrepreneur, you can just be an entrepreneur. You don't need to spend like 7 weeks, or however long it is to 412 01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:59.599 Jenny Duan: to be in this program, because 413 01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:12.340 Jenny Duan: oh, it's for it's 4 weeks, 4 weeks, because 4 weeks is a long part of your summer, and you need to consider, like your time is your most valuable resource, especially because we only have like a one month, one year. Sorry one year 414 01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:31.010 Jenny Duan: time before you start playing to colleges. And so what does one month look like? And what could you be able to accomplish in one month? Because if you go to launch X, then you're at lawn checks for one month, you're not going to be able to have that time to spend working on your other projects, or building something else which could be more valuable at that most critical part of your application process. 415 01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:56.240 Jenny Duan: So because of that, I recommend not doing Launch X. But again, it's it's up to you. this is a decision you can think about in terms of how you feel about yourself things that you're passionate with. But I would say, if you're going to apply for a summer program, we can work together to find one that's a better fit for you than long check. I'm not saying don't apply for a summer program at all. I'm just saying, if you're interested in entrepreneurship and learning how to collaborate and lead other people 416 01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:09.830 huda: the best way to do that might not be to go to camp to do that. Does that make sense? Yeah, also, in that manner. I also wanted to talk about internships, and like, how important are they in my application. 417 01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:33.600 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah, I think that internships are important because they show that you can commit to something, and that you can, that you have these intellectual skills. So whenever we consider any part of a college application, we need to think about like, why does a college want to see this? You know, for example, why does the college want to see your grades? Well, they want to know that you're prepared for the academic river of their institution. So 418 01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.349 Jenny Duan: why, what a college 419 01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:44.920 Jenny Duan: you want an internship? Well, they want you to have skills, and that you can commit to something. And are you thinking about doing internships next summer? 420 01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:48.229 Jenny Duan: Or I guess. What is the context of this question? 421 01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:52.970 huda: Yeah. So I I definitely want to do an internship next summer. But 422 01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.610 huda: it's really hard for anyone as a high school student, and like 423 01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:08.489 huda: kind of related to what I'm doing, machine learning or computer science. It's hard to find internships. I've been trying to search online. But I I can't really find any opportunities. 424 01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:12.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah, have you considered research as at all? 425 01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:18.369 huda: yeah, actually, I tried reaching out to professors near me. 426 01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:27.630 huda: for research. But my other mentors that I should kind of put down the backbench because 427 01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:38.320 huda: it's kind of not as important, since I'm going more on the passion side of the playing, since there's like the spike in the well rounded, I'm more like the spike. So 428 01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:46.620 Jenny Duan: and what's your spike? Would you just want Like, if I'm applying this computer science? then my spike would be like my video and passion. 429 01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:51.350 huda: And if I was applying for film, it would be like my computer science passion 430 01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.130 Jenny Duan: gotcha. 431 01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:57.790 Jenny Duan: So I think that we can find maybe a way to integrate 432 01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.340 Jenny Duan: research with your other passion. So 433 01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:17.050 Jenny Duan: the reason why research is such a popular extracurricular is because it demonstrates your intellectual vitality. That's the thing about research is, it shows the college that you are capable enough and that you are 434 01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:24.280 Jenny Duan: knowledgeable enough to conduct research, which is innovation basically on a scientific level. 435 01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:29.110 Jenny Duan: and I think that 436 01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:38.360 Jenny Duan: How? How academic would you say you are like compared to other people at your school? Would you say that you're like the most academic person. Or do you feel like. 437 01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:41.569 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how strong do you feel like your academics are? 438 01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:47.849 huda: I wouldn't say I'm like the most strong academic person at my school. But 439 01:15:47.930 --> 01:16:11.379 huda: I'm definitely like I'm willing to. I put a lot of time in school for my education, and I definitely prioritize my grades a lot and like my breaker, I think it's pretty because I'm self setting a piece. I'm doing college courses and 2 lots of Aps as well. So I feel like my academic rigor is pretty high in comparison to 440 01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.249 huda: like the majority of the school. 441 01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:16.260 Jenny Duan: How long do you spend doing homework every day. 442 01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.770 huda: last year I spent like 443 01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.730 huda: like 4 h per day, but I think it's probably going to increase because I'm taking like 4 aps 444 01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:31.930 huda: and like a college course. So yeah. 445 01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:39.860 Jenny Duan: okay, who? I'm going to be honest with you. You spend too much time on school. I know that. That's probably something that 446 01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:52.770 Jenny Duan: is, it seems very counterintuitive. Because, you know, as a student, we're told that you need to focus on school, you get good grades and all that is important. But when we think about your time, you have 24 h in a day, you're going to be at school for like 447 01:16:52.780 --> 01:17:03.570 Jenny Duan: 8 h, 6 h, 7 h. You're gonna be sleeping for 8 h hopefully. And if the rest of your remaining 8 h, if let's say, like 3 of them are spent 448 01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:06.290 Jenny Duan: going to the bathroom, you know, getting ready eating like 449 01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:14.200 Jenny Duan: no, let's say 2 h, for, like everything else, then that means you only have 6 h left right, because 8 h in school, 8 h sleeping. 450 01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.029 Jenny Duan: and 2 h like eating transportation, going to the bathroom. All that that means 451 01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:24.329 Jenny Duan: you only have 6 h left left, and if you spend 4 of those hours 452 01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:30.559 Jenny Duan: doing homework, then you only have 2 h to work on everything else, which is not a lot of time. 453 01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:38.660 Jenny Duan: So we, I think we need to think about, how do we maximize your time and create the biggest impact in the smallest amount of time possible. 454 01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.760 Jenny Duan: So 455 01:17:42.130 --> 01:18:01.450 Jenny Duan: I think this is a really interesting area that we need to talk about in the future. But back to the research and summer program. internship conversation. I think that doing some type of research that's connected to things that you're passionate about and already working on can be a good way to spend one of your summers because 456 01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.219 Jenny Duan: I think that 457 01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:10.370 Jenny Duan: you have a really strong academic profile, but it doesn't stand out to me. 458 01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:28.949 Jenny Duan: does that make sense like you are very smart, and you have great academics. But every single applicant to these schools has great academics. No one's going to be applied to a top school with a 3.0 Gpa, right? So everything around you has great academic. So how do you make yourself stand out and show that you are 459 01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:36.409 Jenny Duan: willing to be at the academic rigor that a competitive institution like Harvard Stanford, Berkeley, Ucla would require. 460 01:18:36.410 --> 01:19:01.199 Jenny Duan: And I think research is one way to do that. And this doesn't mean pick a random research topic. It means pick something that's related to what you're already doing and what you're already passionate about. And I think one interesting area that we can explore is the use of AI in film. For example, AI generated film, AI generated imagery and things like that. So I think that that would be a really interesting research area to explore. 461 01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:11.429 Jenny Duan: And the re. The way that I did this is in my experience. I reached out to people at at local universities, and you said that you did some cold outreach, and it wasn't working. Can you tell me a little bit more about that. 462 01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:35.179 huda: Yeah. So at that time I didn't really like focus on film production. So I was reaching out to like computer science and AI professors at the local community college. And I did some research on them. And like, I found what studies they did and things like that. And I made like a email template. 463 01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:46.690 huda: And I would put like details of their research and things that they're interested in. But I didn't really get a response back. So yeah, 464 01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:51.119 Jenny Duan: I'm going to tell you why you didn't get a response back. And then we're going to talk about how we move forward. 465 01:19:51.130 --> 01:20:14.359 Jenny Duan: So the reason why I think you didn't get a response back is not because your emails are bad or anything. But it's because we're identifying the wrong demographic. So community college professors are very busy teaching. That is their main priority. community colleges are really great for teaching, but they don't do as much research as larger institutions like Stanford, Santa Clara. 466 01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:32.659 Jenny Duan: Those types of schools would do, and because of that they might not have a lot of time to offer you research positions, because they also don't have enough funding to support additional positions in their labs. They might be very busy again handling their teaching, because that's the priority at a community college. So I think when we think about research, we need to identify 467 01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.219 Jenny Duan: departments are aligned with what you already do, as well as 468 01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:54.359 Jenny Duan: places that would have the funding time and opportunity to mentor you, because a lot of research, especially in high school, is not necessarily about the actual research, but it's about mentoring the student and ensuring that they're aware of how science research works, how grant funding works and all of that. So 469 01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.639 Jenny Duan: I think that's something that we can change in our target. 470 01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:20.090 Jenny Duan: And I know that we have the last 7 min of our conversation. So I really want to take this time to solidify a plan and talk about next steps. So we talked about a lot of things today. which I think each of the things we talked about could be another conversation. But let's break down the concrete steps you can take to Take some of the things that we talked about and turn them into actionable items. 471 01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:23.970 huda: does that sound good to you? 472 01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:30.910 Jenny Duan: So one thing. So the things that we talked about are summer plans. 473 01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:35.080 Jenny Duan: Time blocking 474 01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.710 Jenny Duan: had. time, blocking means, like schedule. 475 01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.880 Jenny Duan: passion projects. So this includes 476 01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:49.809 Jenny Duan: your Youtube channel the game that you're creating as well as small business idea. 477 01:21:49.900 --> 01:22:14.849 Jenny Duan: And the hackathon. Those were like a couple of the projects that we talked about. And I think that one misconception people have is that you can only have one passion project. But in reality I think you can have multiple. They could connect to each other. it doesn't have to be like. There's only one thing you're working on. If you're passionate about doing multiple things, you can do that in your own time, and we can create time in the schedule that we create to have for all of these things. 478 01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:29.689 Jenny Duan: so passion projects. the Youtube channel, the game, the small business idea, the hackathon. those are all really powerful things in in summer plans. We talked about research. We also talked about internships, and we talked about summer programs. 479 01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.209 Jenny Duan: and then the other thing that we talked about was 480 01:22:33.710 --> 01:22:38.029 Jenny Duan: community service, and how you can integrate that with your passion projects. 481 01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:43.220 Jenny Duan: let's see, integrate with Asian projects as well as awards. 482 01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:47.569 Jenny Duan: So the ones that we talked about are signs great through 483 01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.040 Jenny Duan: science break the breakthrough, challenge 484 01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.680 Jenny Duan: science, ambassador scholarship. 485 01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:05.669 Jenny Duan: the aspirations and computing award. This is the Nc. We, one aspirations in computing. 486 01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:10.070 Jenny Duan: That's the Ncw. It. One and 487 01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:17.530 Jenny Duan: for summer programs. We talked about J. Camp, which is the Asian American Journalism Association one 488 01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:19.210 Jenny Duan: and 489 01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:30.440 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay. And then these are the things that talked about. Let me just check if there's anything else. perfect. 490 01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:33.120 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And then we also talked about like 491 01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:42.560 Jenny Duan: advocacy and impact. So I'm just going to make those small sections and moving forward. I think. Let's say, some concrete action items. 492 01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:53.710 Jenny Duan: the first auction item, I think, would be to email the national history day. people that were in the National History day, California website. 493 01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.600 Jenny Duan: So I think you should do that. I think. Also 494 01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:01.430 Jenny Duan: sign up 495 01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.719 Jenny Duan: for the young Arts mailing list 496 01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.460 Jenny Duan: and then 497 01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:16.150 Jenny Duan: moving forward with your passion projects. I think we've identified a lot of potential ones. 498 01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:20.659 Jenny Duan: I think that our next step would be to time block. 499 01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:22.350 Jenny Duan: hey? Scheduled 500 01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.500 Jenny Duan: for each Passion Project. 501 01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:36.180 Jenny Duan: and also plan out your schedule for the next school year and then identify the key strategy for next summer. 502 01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:44.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think these are a couple of action items that I'm identifying right now. Is there anything that stands out to you that you would want to add onto that list? 503 01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:51.330 huda: maybe. 504 01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.589 huda: Yeah. I think that says it all. But maybe I can talk about 505 01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:04.900 huda: Considering journalism and 506 01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:15.960 huda: I could do more research about like the journalism field. And like different programs and different schools like you said in Stanford, they have the 507 01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.930 huda: AI bias program. 508 01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:26.480 huda: yeah, I think I could do some more research on the actual courses. 509 01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:31.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. And I'm happy to give you a list of that. 510 01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:47.870 Jenny Duan: First, I think another program that you should apply for for next summer. I'm going to write this down to. It's called Stanford AI. For all. And this is different from the Stanford Pre college program. It's a specific program for high school students that was started by Fifa Lee. Are you familiar with her? 511 01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:49.950 huda: no. 512 01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.479 Jenny Duan: she's one of the she's one of the most impactful people at Stanford. But 513 01:25:54.590 --> 01:26:08.980 Jenny Duan: for people who do this program they do small group research projects about the social impacts of AI and how AI can be used to address our most pressing problems. So this might be a really good way to combine your passion for research, and also with that social advocacy. 514 01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:13.160 Jenny Duan: So I think this is a really standout program that we can talk about 515 01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:17.179 Jenny Duan: and apply for for sure. 516 01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:24.789 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I know that we talked about a lot of things so far. do you have any questions about 517 01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:30.670 Jenny Duan: what we're going to be working on in the future, and what ideas you might have. 518 01:26:31.050 --> 01:26:37.899 huda: Yeah. So will you be able to help me? find internship and research for next summer? 519 01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:57.660 Jenny Duan: Yes, I think that this is something specifically we can work on together, is creating a schedule that allows room for all of your passion projects and then also creating an application and game plan for next year, including a timeline of all the awards, like in internships that you're going to be applying for for next summer. So summer programs, internships and awards. 520 01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:00.840 huda: Yeah, that sounds good. 521 01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And 522 01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:14.990 Jenny Duan: with that, do you have any other questions as we wrap up anything else that you're curious about about the college application process, or any thing that I can talk about from my own experience in college that you're wondering about. 523 01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:28.999 huda: Yeah. So you said you? did a documentary in high school? How did you like come about that like? Where did you post it? What was it about? And how is it? Like. 524 01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:51.199 Jenny Duan: yeah, I saw, I did a short video series about the Asian American community in Chinatown during the pandemic and how that's actually impacted small businesses. So it's pretty similar to what you are thinking about doing. And it's just a Youtube series. But I think the biggest thing about that is that I was able to get a network of other students to work with me and to really expand that 525 01:27:51.200 --> 01:28:01.439 Jenny Duan: And I think that that's what made it bigger from like an individual contributor impact to having like a national or community. Why, like team player impact. 526 01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:06.809 huda: that sounds so cool? can I see that? Can I see your documentary? 527 01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:13.260 Jenny Duan: Sure. Yeah, let me just send you a link. It's not a documentary, really. It's a video series. But yeah. 528 01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.849 Jenny Duan: let me just send it to you. 529 01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:30.739 Jenny Duan: And I think one misconception is that you have to have like perfect video video skills before posting. I think the most important thing is to just get your content out there. 530 01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.109 Jenny Duan: And yeah. 531 01:28:33.150 --> 01:28:41.690 Jenny Duan: so I'm just gonna send this channel to you. The videos, like at the bottom are what I've made there. Someone else has taken over the 532 01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:52.049 Jenny Duan: someone else has taken over the channel. So they're they're posting different things now. But like the very first couple of videos are the ones that we made me and my team 533 01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.890 huda: actually cool. 534 01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 535 01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.100 Jenny Duan: well, 536 01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:13.499 Jenny Duan: so yeah, moving forward, I'd love to know what your availability is for setting up sessions. If this is something that you'd be interested in and how we can best work together. 537 01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:32.879 huda: Yeah, definitely, I really loved. this quality, and I think it was very insightful and definitely like way more specific than anything I've ever tried. So thank you so much? And yeah, definitely, we could set up meetings like either weekly or by weekly 538 01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:37.560 huda: or not by weekly, but like 2 times a week or so like that. 539 01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:39.490 Ivy Mentors: Wow! 540 01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:48.990 Ivy Mentors: That is music to my years. Actually, and I'm actually now, you know, do you have like 50 more minutes. You know, there are multiple things I kind of want to connect. So 541 01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.600 Ivy Mentors: thanks a lot. I think, Jenny, I'm just like 542 01:29:51.770 --> 01:30:05.850 Ivy Mentors: Number one. as a dad. Of course, you know, between my both roles I always will be a dad first. and it's it's giving me a lot of comfort, I think, as I shared with you. We just had this 543 01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:09.159 Ivy Mentors: very anxious and stressful session yesterday. 544 01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:26.910 Ivy Mentors: despite all the great skills that Hoda has, I've been really struggling, and and I told you I've shared you with my like even my former story. I struggle to this the first time, and I genuinely believe the value that met us like yourself can offer. I'm very, very genuinely, I believe I believe in it. 545 01:30:27.010 --> 01:30:29.840 Ivy Mentors: but I was still struggling to find where the issue is. 546 01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:36.489 Ivy Mentors: And I think you really you I think we are very holistically taken a stab at this. 547 01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:42.250 Ivy Mentors: I know that even though we came to you mainly, for like extracurriculars. 548 01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:47.780 Ivy Mentors: I think you really opened up a lot of horizon and 549 01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:58.380 Ivy Mentors: and I think you've also like kind of gone one level, deeper right? And this is this is exactly one of the challenges which we did not discuss in any other, any other session, or with any other mentor 550 01:30:58.690 --> 01:30:59.710 Ivy Mentors: where 551 01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:18.430 Ivy Mentors: we are all like so focused on the kind of I would say means, like, you know, just like do x to y, but I mean, there is like the core core challenges mindset barrier style. I think that is so fundamental. Those foundational things, and every student is so different, and every like child is so different. 552 01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:26.179 Ivy Mentors: And then also, like the way these are all our perceptions and certain misconceptions. And a lot of these things where we feel like. 553 01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:30.320 Ivy Mentors: Oh, you need to do X to to to get into this, or you need to do why 554 01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:40.839 Ivy Mentors: So I think you've really opened up that thing for us, and I think I'm I'm glad to hear that very German reaction. To be very honest, like I was a not even sure whether 555 01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.169 Ivy Mentors: I should really 556 01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:55.820 Ivy Mentors: put that through this kind of whole. you know, mentorship program, you know more because I think there's some initial value that we were able to get out of the strategy. And you know, with the other mentor. So I think thanks a lot for that first. 557 01:31:55.850 --> 01:32:00.740 Ivy Mentors: And it's you know I who that was absolutely independent 558 01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:11.780 Ivy Mentors: and she was able to like in, you know, it's a very instant reaction from her to say, Oh, yeah, I would love to actually even work like on a my like twice a week. so 559 01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:24.690 Ivy Mentors: thanks a lot that about that. And I'm definitely gonna also have like, what about separate conversation with Huda to kind of really? see? How does she feel now? What are the areas where she really needs help? But 560 01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:31.259 Ivy Mentors: I would like to ask you, you know, just in terms of the program that we can really design for. who? The 561 01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:42.139 Ivy Mentors: Because the 3 3 things are kind of resonated. Or you know, if I were to really like bucket it into 3 things. Really, it's one is the whole strategy. And the game plan around like, how are 562 01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:49.299 Ivy Mentors: we going to really help? Or how are you really going to help with the make it into her, like, you know, dream schools, or whatever top schools? 563 01:32:49.420 --> 01:33:09.649 Ivy Mentors: it's very competitive, but at least like to do the best game plan as possible. Then, again, is you know the planning right? And and this is where, like time, management, and planning. And how do you juggle with all these things? And I know as a dad, that's one. Also one of the weak areas that Huda has right where she's she's not able to really progress on every front. 564 01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:23.199 Ivy Mentors: A one is not knowing what to do, but second is also, if she knows what to do, then it's just not possible. Right? So I think your your whole thing about maximizing time that's a foundational skill where I I really believe that your help can really help us. as as a mentor. 565 01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:30.649 Ivy Mentors: And the third one is really like executing it. So having an action item and plan. So it's your typical strategy planning and execution. 566 01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:54.509 Ivy Mentors: I would love to get a very candid view from from you like you know about how do you view like, you know, a a student like the how do you think? What kind of a cadence and what kind of a program? And you don't have to answer it right now, and that will be a part of our other, my other hat, where I would love you to design this, and and literally like, sell it to me, and I'm gonna buy it because I'm all sold for it now, because my daughter has agreed right like that. She wants this help? 567 01:33:54.540 --> 01:34:15.560 Ivy Mentors: but at a very high level I want you to hear this from you. and and to like, what do you think are her key. Weak areas. And how do? What kind of a cadence do you think can help her? Because you you brought up this important point that we also are a bit late into this process. Right game, because, you know, I wish we had met you like last year. 568 01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:19.350 Ivy Mentors: so we only have like a year now and then. She has this one month in summer. 569 01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:35.879 Ivy Mentors: And there are like too many things. So that's a bit like I'm I'm a bit scared. Now, right? So tell me, what do you think would be a good kind of cadence? And what are the areas that you you think you would actually more help Huda on that Joda needs help on. I would love to hear your thoughts. 570 01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.620 Jenny Duan: Who? That? 571 01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:44.969 Jenny Duan: I know that you are exceptional, and I know that you are great. I want you to believe it for yourself. 572 01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:56.430 Jenny Duan: So I think that's what we can work on. The most is just having that leadership initiative and drive. I think I see it in you, but I want you to believe it for yourself. 573 01:34:56.450 --> 01:35:20.960 Jenny Duan: I think that you spend too much time on school, in my opinion, and I think that you should spend more time cultivating those extra curriculums because there are a million 4.0 students. But there is no one else who's built a game like you have. There's no one else who's leading a Vfx club who's doing all these things, and we want that to shine because your academic background is speaks for yourself. It speaks for itself. 574 01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:31.140 Jenny Duan: You're smart. You don't need to spend too many time too much time doing that. So I think one thing is optimizing how much time we spend on school and other things and helping you do that. 575 01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:38.310 Jenny Duan: I think that's one thing. Second thing, I think that you might struggle with is lack of awareness of opportunities, and 576 01:35:38.310 --> 01:36:03.829 Jenny Duan: that's something that I can also help you with crafting specific tailored activities that fit your profile, fit your goals, because obviously every student has different needs and different things that might help them. For example, a student studying business might go to lawn checks because they want to learn how to build a business. But you're not setting business. So why should you do that you should do something that's more specific towards you, something that can align with the experience that you already have. And maybe that's 577 01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:22.269 Jenny Duan: one reason why you're struggling to apply for these summer programs is because you're applying for programs that don't fit you. For example, you're not going to apply for astrophysics research because you don't do astrophysics research, right? You're going to apply for something that has to do with film communication, journalism, computer science and things like that. So let's work towards that. 578 01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:28.099 Jenny Duan: And I think another thing is working on your leadership. I think this is 579 01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:48.669 Jenny Duan: something that a lot of top schools really look for is your ability to lead other people? Because you know Stanford Harvard, they're looking for the future leaders of America. And what does that mean? That means people who can take initiative. That means people who can organize manage as well as get their own work done. So I think I'd like to see you take a more, a larger leadership role 580 01:36:48.710 --> 01:37:00.450 Jenny Duan: in your school, in, you know your classes in your community and all around. So I think that that's one thing that we can work on together is how we develop that leadership within you. 581 01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:07.639 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. I think that's music to your my, yours. And and in terms of just the execution aspect. 582 01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:11.770 Ivy Mentors: I I love this kind of core fundamental things, and I so clearly see the value 583 01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:28.390 Ivy Mentors: like. just to kind of recap first is really about the planning right? Like, in terms of like, how to manage time and optimize way to focus. I think you're gonna put that framework and stuff like that. that falls under kind of planning. And then the second thing 584 01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:56.519 Ivy Mentors: I think, lack of awareness and being more specific. It's kind of a bit of strategy and access to information. So you're gonna really help with bringing in that like offline resources where she that's one of the challenges. Why, she's not able to do some of this, and I would imagine that would actually kind of fix some of the execution issue right? It's not that she doesn't want to do it. Otherwise, if she was not a a a doer she would have probably not developed the game. So I think she clearly has that. I think there are you you you you've really identified some root causes here. 585 01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:05.380 Ivy Mentors: And then finally, I think there's also a very mindset, oriented thing, with her nature and style of being very quiet and introvert. She's not able to really go out and take that initiative 586 01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:16.040 Ivy Mentors: right? So that that would be it. So what what do you think will be a good kind of a cadence, you know, for you know, for someone like you to help like the, for example. 587 01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:23.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it depends on how involved. Who do you want me to be with your passion projects. I think the 588 01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:45.340 Jenny Duan: general strategy guidance. Obviously this doesn't take too much time. It's more like giving you the opportunities, and you can apply for them, and do things on your own time. I think that's about once a week will be enough. But if you want depending on how much support you need with your passion projects. I think that would be additional time if we want to like work on building that together. 589 01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:57.299 Jenny Duan: But that just depends on how you're feeling. And then, obviously, if you want specific help with an application or something like that, we can do it additional time to support you on that. But I think starting out 590 01:38:57.430 --> 01:39:10.940 Jenny Duan: probably once a week, with those additional like support sessions as needed. might be a good fit for now. But I'm curious to see like, do you feel like you would want extra support? Or do you feel like you would want less support? What do you think? How can I best help you? 591 01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:16.069 huda: Yeah. So I think we could start out by doing a weekly call 592 01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:22.059 huda: and see if like, if I need your support, like with the passion projects 593 01:39:22.150 --> 01:39:31.970 huda: for more time. Then maybe we could do like another session. that we can see how that works. But as for now, I think we should start up with a weekly call. 594 01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:41.459 Ivy Mentors: Great. I I think that is that that is, absolutely, I think, even like having a weekly once. we're 595 01:39:41.500 --> 01:40:04.939 Ivy Mentors: I think, number one also. Thanks for redefining. what fashion project has for us. Right? Because, And of course, like, you know, different people have different part of view. I'm also a big admirer of really focusing on one thing and getting it done. Well, but I think here the point was what is really a passion project, I mean just tying it to the community fact. But now you see, like how the passion project. 596 01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:15.679 Ivy Mentors: In fact, what we are doing. What you have done is really helped. Huda and me see the passion project through the see extra curricular through the lens of Passion Project number one 597 01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:24.519 Ivy Mentors: and and in fact, it's pretty much now synonymous right? It's like extracurricular to that, for you is Fashion Project. But 598 01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:36.479 Ivy Mentors: the gaming is just one component of it, right? I think you have really like structured the project, for, you know, like it's not just enough for you to just execute and deliver because you're not just an engineer. Here. 599 01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:49.950 Ivy Mentors: What you are is actually it is you, and and you have to demonstrate. So I think that's the game plan. And I've I think that planning that accountability is another thing that I you know there's one thing which is execution support where you can. Actually 600 01:40:49.950 --> 01:41:07.520 Ivy Mentors: I I would love to understand from Huda what execution support, because now it's no more just about game development to that it. I think we have to reassess this because game development, I agree, even like Janice, for example, like, you know, because you are a good developer. You don't really need an upskilling or a a code feature like for you to to help you how to code. 601 01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:18.660 Ivy Mentors: I think. But now, when it comes to Youtube channel social media. I think that wealth of information and a very technical and specific information that Jenny has given us. 602 01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:27.260 Ivy Mentors: It makes me wonder that there would be a very different need from an execution perspective as well. Right? So I'm just saying my point of view, and more than happy to discuss offline. 603 01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:49.869 Ivy Mentors: but I think at least with the one week, you know more than happy to, you know. Kick, start, get started. So what I would request you. Jenny is like, you know. Thanks a lot for this. And Iv mentors what I would request is like, you know, if you could just like structure it for us, like, you know the plan of this package. Just give it a name so that you know, I'm able to really like, you know. See what it is. And then 604 01:41:49.870 --> 01:42:05.649 Ivy Mentors: we can get started with like 10 weeks to start with, and beyond that we could just keep extending it, because I would love for Hoda, because it's it's the game plan that is now coming out of your collaboration. So I would really want you to really be her kind of partner through the journey. 605 01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:13.949 Ivy Mentors: right? and and and that is what I firmly believe can can really help with that. So let's touch based on that as a next step. 606 01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:15.459 Jenny Duan: cool, sounds good. 607 01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:18.400 Ivy Mentors: amazing. Hold on, is that? Okay. 608 01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:23.560 huda: yeah, thank you so much, Jenny, this is such an insightful call. 609 01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:25.560 Jenny Duan: Yeah, thank you. 610 01:42:25.710 --> 01:42:47.309 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. So thanks a lot, Jenny. So I think, as a in our next connector, whatever you want to do. you know, I think first, like, if you have time today, just, you know, send me like an email to you know, my, I we mentor's Id and say, Hey, I I think this is a good way to package this program for Roda, and you know this is what you can do, and you can put some agenda and like just label it. I think all this information is already here. 611 01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.200 Ivy Mentors: then I can check with that as well. And let's see, let's start to get started with 10 weeks thing. 612 01:42:52.220 --> 01:43:02.670 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I I think this is a co-creation. Right? I mean, we have really created something, understanding our needs. And I love it. And even this particular session that you did 613 01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:11.130 Ivy Mentors: this is itself has so much value, like the things that have come out of it. And I would love to really like, you know. Take even this session and and offer this to many more students 614 01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:28.629 Ivy Mentors: even many more students like Huda, for example, right? You could clearly see, like you know, how a student like who the living, like, you know, not having enough access, living in kind of a non, very, not very competitive school has a disadvantage. But I hope there is an advantage to, because she's compared within her kind of school system. Right? 615 01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:29.440 Okay. 616 01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:35.970 Ivy Mentors: great. Thank you.",

    "1 00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.810 Jenny Duan: Hi, Huda, how's it going? 2 00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.980 huda: Okay. 3 00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.170 Jenny Duan: Hi, it's really nice to meet you. I'm Jenny, and I go to Stanford, and I'd love to learn a little bit more about you. 4 00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.720 huda: Hmm. 5 00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.290 huda: yeah. I don't know if my dad shared the document already. 6 00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.280 huda: Probably I could share. You know I wasn't back to my calls. Yeah, so feel free to bring it up, and you can share it as well. 7 00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.670 Ivy Mentors: Thanks, Jenny, for joining. And also who does that. So I'm I'm just, gonna you know. Listen to this. thanks for your time. 8 00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.279 Jenny Duan: of course. Yeah. 9 00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:15.799 Jenny Duan: So I can go ahead and introduce myself. And then I'd love to learn a little bit more about you and I have a couple of questions for you as well, but I'm excited to be working together. 10 00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.750 huda: Yeah, me, too 11 00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:44.069 Jenny Duan: awesome. So I'm an incoming sophomore at Stanford. And I'm studying symbolic systems, which is an interdisciplinary major that combines computer science philosophy and psychology. I personally think it's a really cool program, especially because I'm the type of person who had a lot of different interest in high school and wanted to combine them all to make a new thing. But what I'm really passionate about is artificial intelligence, and that's what I'm studying in school. 12 00:01:44.310 --> 00:02:10.100 Jenny Duan: and in high school I was involved with a lot of different things. your dad told me that you're you're interested in film and in high school. I also made documentary videos, and that was one of the things that I found really rewarding and valuable to. So I'm excited to connect on that. But I'd love to learn a little bit more about you. So mayb",
    "e where you go to school, and some of the things that you're interested in. 13 00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:28.769 huda: Yeah. So my name is Heather and I go to Mountain House. My school. it's not as competitive and definitely like. It's in the Dublin area. If you know where that is? And 14 00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.769 huda: so it's not that competitive. But 15 00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:40.449 huda: as for my passions, I'm really interested in in computer science and just like you artificial intelligence? 16 00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.760 and also phone 17 00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:51.919 huda: and I'm looking to major in a film for some schools and computer science and some other schools. 18 00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.360 huda: and I just really needed guidance for, like my extra curriculum, because my profile is pretty weak. So 19 00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.300 huda: yeah. 20 00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:14.270 Jenny Duan: yeah, And can you tell me how you're feeling about this process in the types of things that you're worried about. So you mentioned that you're looking for help in extracurriculars? Why does this stand out as an area that you want to work on. 21 00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.070 huda: Yeah, definitely. So 22 00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:32.939 huda: for extracurriculars. I sometimes I don't know what to do, because it's so vague and there's never like specific things that we're told to do. for example, I don't have that many awards or owners 23 00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:45.819 huda: and like I just don't know what to search for, and I kind of needed specific help on finding these things. because I had a previous mentor who 24 00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:56.970 huda: told me to find film festivals that are national, but didn't have them any competitors. And I've tried searching for them. But they're obviously kind of hard to find. So 25 00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.330 Jenny Duan: yeah, completely. So 26 00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:24.650 Jenny Duan: this is really useful information for me. ",
    "Can you talk about your experience in school? So far? So you mentioned that? this is a public school? Right? Yeah, yeah. So we'll have a some time to go over your extra curriculum and dive really deep into that film aspect later. But I love to learn about how you're feeling about school and what classes. And subjects you're, interested in and what classes you've taken so far 27 00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:45.019 huda: so I'm by the end of high school. I've taken 11 a piece and 5 honors. and I think I'd say my academic rigor is pretty high and I'm also, applying to like a community college course to take this full 28 00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.429 huda: and I got a 5 on the Ap Hub exam. and I just I think my academic rigor is probably one of my 29 00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.309 huda: strength, but I don't think that has much of a weight in the actual decision itself. So 30 00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.250 huda: yeah. 31 00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.130 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah, so can you tell me what your Gpa is? So far? 32 00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.659 huda: Yeah. So I have a 4.3 Gpa. 33 00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.260 huda: and 4 unrelated. 34 00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.999 huda: I think it was like 3.9 6 or something like that. 35 00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.009 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And do you know how this compares to sort of the other people in your school 36 00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:29.869 huda: so I think, like many people have the same around the same Gpa or less. 37 00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.240 huda: they have they offer like 18 aps at our school. 38 00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:50.650 huda: I'm taking 11 just because you're not allowed to take any of them in freshman year and sophomore. You only took one because we moved here this summer before freshman year, so I couldn't sign up for one of the Aps. 39 00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.109 huda: So I think that's somewhere where I kinda missed that on 40 00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:08.550 Jenny Duan: yeah, totally understand? And you mentioned th",
    "at you're signing up for community college classes. Is that right? Do you know what impact those have on your Gpa. If any, or is it separate from your gpu? 41 00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:20.870 huda: It's separate, but It does come as credits. And I've heard that they kind of have a they show that you're more rigorous. And you're trying to outsource different 42 00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.250 huda: programs. So I feel like, I think it's beneficial to your academics. 43 00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And what costs are you considering taking at the community college. 44 00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.060 huda: I'll say I'm taking psi or a film production. 45 00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.719 Jenny Duan: of course, that community college. Why, Polyside 46 00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.420 huda: just because it's 47 00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:52.599 huda: kind of like one of our courses at our schools govern Econ. And I kind of want like a foundation for that. And I think it's just pretty interesting as a class. 48 00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.720 Jenny Duan: And are you deciding between those 2? Are you pretty set on taking Polyside? 49 00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:06.480 huda: I'm still deciding, but I think I'm kind of leaning towards film, actually, because it kinda shows it. I'm interested in reaching out more. 50 00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:21.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would also probably recommend you to take that phone class, just because it connects with the other things that you're passionate as well. passionate in as well. And So I took a look at your extracurriculars. They look great. I 51 00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:39.360 Jenny Duan: be willing to talk about them further in detail in a little bit. So we'll come back to this. But I'm curious what kind of roles you see yourself taking up at school because I looked at your extracurriculars, and a lot of them are outside of school. So I'm curious to see. What kind of roles you're you see yourself in at school? 52 00:07:39.740 --> 00:07",
    ":57.159 Jenny Duan: Are you involved in any clubs? I know you're part of the I think. Vfx Club. which is awesome, your president. But at school would you say that? You know you're more? Do you talk a lot in your classes. Are you more quiet? Do you have a big friend group? Can you tell me about how school is going for you? 53 00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:10.379 huda: So I'm kind of like a quiet person. I do have like a friend group, but and they do like take academic seriously. But I feel like, yeah, I am definitely more of a quiet person at school. 54 00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.570 Jenny Duan: And would you say that your friend group is 55 00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:25.570 Jenny Duan: a a bit competitive, or is it more collaborative? How would you describe, because I've heard a lot about the Bay area. So you know, I'm just curious to hear your perspective on that. 56 00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:45.339 huda: Hmm. There's like a couple of people who are competitive or more collaborative. But most of them honestly don't take school that seriously. But the ones that do are definitely more collaborative. cause. Actually, me and my friend are thinking of starting a machine learning club at our school. 57 00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.950 huda: and we're trying to expand it so that other schools can have the same code 58 00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.900 Jenny Duan: that's really awesome. 59 00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:17.930 Jenny Duan: and the reason why I'm asking this is because I'm trying to get a sense of some things that your teachers or your peers might say about you, because for a lot of these really competitive schools that we're looking at applying to like Ucla mit Stanford, etc. That you have on your list. one important aspect of this is your letter of recommendation, for so have you thought about what teachers you want to ask, because I think Junior Year is a great 60 00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:24.689 huda: time to start thinking about that 61 00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:42.119 huda: teacher at li",
    "ke a few years, I think, on freshman year and sophomore year. Actually, And she's actually going into the film industry. And we've been like pretty close, and she knows me pretty well personally. So. 62 00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:51.939 huda: I'm thinking of getting a letter of recommendation for her, because she knows like my passion for film production. And she's from the business. So yeah. 63 00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.270 huda: And I'm also thinking of asking, like. 64 00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.060 huda: maybe my English teachers, and she knows 65 00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.760 huda: Well, she's like 66 00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:16.739 huda: a pretty good writer. And also she sent several students in her class to the John Locke writing competition. So I feel like getting a letter of recommendation from her is definitely prestigious. 67 00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:40.550 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's awesome. So the first one is, did you say that they were a film teacher? Or what subject? Okay, awesome. And do you have a stem teacher that's willing to write you a lot of recommendation, because usually colleges, especially since you have this strong technical background as well. It would be useful to have someone talk about your skills and math computer science or another stem field. 68 00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.629 huda: Yeah, I definitely, I have a a computer science teacher. 69 00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.389 huda: she's taught me since sophomore year, and I think 70 00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.849 huda: to senior. So we'll probably have like a good bond by then. So yeah. 71 00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:02.550 Jenny Duan: okay, so I would. When considering your letters of recommendation. I'd probably try to focus on that stem teacher and that English teacher for your main 72 00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:27.540 Jenny Duan: level for your main recommendation. But then you'll also have the option to add a third recommender which could be your film teacher. And the reason for this is that the letter",
    "s of recommendation are another really good way to talk about your intellectual maturity and the things that you're interested in on an intellectual level and having a strong stem. And English teacher will just highlight how academically prepared you are to thrive at a school 73 00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:37.770 that you're looking at. Well, the third, the film teacher, might be able to talk about your passions, and the extracurricular involvement that you that you have, as well as your leadership in that Vfx Club, which is super important. 74 00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.769 Jenny Duan: So I would probably keep that top of mind as you enter your senior year 75 00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:54.759 Jenny Duan: and So another thing that I wanted to ask you about is, just what do you have any idea of what you want to do in the future as in career pads and navigating that. 76 00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:02.160 huda: Yeah. So I wanna definitely get into the software engineering field. 77 00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:12.790 huda: if I do an end up majoring in computer science, because I'm thinking of planning, or I'm thinking of applying to public schools as a 78 00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:20.560 huda: computer science major and private schools as a film major, in case like, I decide to switch or minor in the other. 79 00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.480 huda: but I also have. like 80 00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.929 huda: aspirations of being a film producer 81 00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.000 huda: and being in like the 82 00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.480 huda: movie business. 83 00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:53.030 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is really awesome. So one thing that I'm seeing is this dynamic between film and the technical aspect of Cs right? I think, when crafting your application or looking at your college journey so far, it's maybe interesting and important to find a connection between these 2 aspects. Because. 84 00:12:53.030 --> 00:13:15.199 Jenny Duan: you know, when you're applying for college, you're re",
    "ally showing your whole person. You're not just saying like, I'm only a Cs major, or I am only a film student. You are a person with these interests, and you're trying to present them forwards. And you're right to apply Cs at a public school because, you choosing that because you can't really switch your major. Is that? Why? Yeah, okay? So 85 00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:31.870 Jenny Duan: actually, I have another question for you. If you want to do Cs to do software engineering, why, computer science, do you like coding? Or do you want to become a software engineer? Because if you want to become a software engineer, you don't necessarily need to be a Cs major, or do you love coding. 86 00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:51.560 huda: I I really like coding because I've been I've been coding for like a really long time since. I'd say, like even starting at 8. I started doing like basic coding things. I feel like it's always fascinated me. I've built games. And on this is like, it's just. 87 00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.450 huda: I think I want to major in computer science, because 88 00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.609 huda: well, it's like 89 00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:03.100 huda: good to have Cs as your major. If you're pursuing the fuel. 90 00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:22.089 Jenny Duan: Yeah, totally. the thing that we can consider when doing Cs applications is that it does make it a lot harder, obviously, to get into schools. But if there's another alternative, maybe depending on the school. We can consider things like data signs, cognitive science, information, technology and 91 00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:38.269 Jenny Duan: other similar fields that would still empower you to become a software engineer, but perhaps are not as competitive to get into as Acs program. So we can talk about that moving forward. But one thing that I see in you right now is you have a passion for creating things? 92 00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.570 Jenny Duan: Would you say that? That's true? Yeah. 93 00:14:40.850 --> 00:15:05",
    ".429 Jenny Duan: definitely, I see that definitely in your Vfx. In the game that you created as well as your love for film. And I think that this is where I see the connection between film and Cs. You like to bring things to life, whether or not that's a game, whether or not that's a video. You like to share stories. And I think that code can be a medium for sharing stories. So I think that this is a really good sort of intersection. We can 94 00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:15.129 Jenny Duan: capture like this love for storytelling and bringing worlds to life. Because, you know, when you're creating a video, you're shooting a situation and you have the creative 95 00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:40.119 Jenny Duan: potential and transforming the ordinary into extraordinary things like you can take an ordinary, you know, image the other people might not see and turn into something beautiful in a documentary, or take a couple of lines of code which you know, code is just a tool to create something greater, to create a story through your game. So I think that that is something really, really powerful, that I think is really special in your journey. do you have any thoughts on that? 96 00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:51.820 huda: Yeah, I think definitely like, I really want to tie the my true passions together, because I really want to do both of them. And I don't want to choose. And I think 97 00:15:51.860 --> 00:16:03.489 huda: creating that like connection on my story. Building and stuff will definitely like strengthen my application and passion when I am in college. 98 00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:09.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I've been on this. Let me just try my charges. Look like, yeah, go ahead. 99 00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:38.839 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, Janice. I think she's just running for her charger. I I can give you real time feedback here that this this is great. Yeah. Sorry I could not send it, because it was my mistake. I think she had basically done it. I you know, I had back to back meetings. But",
    " I didn't want 100 00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.560 Ivy Mentors: yeah. 101 00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.749 Ivy Mentors: this is amazing. 102 00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:52.109 Ivy Mentors: I I I definitely feel that had I given you this information as we do, right? So typically like, you know, you could have actually done a more a listed thing. 103 00:16:52.150 --> 00:17:05.360 Ivy Mentors: And because I've been involved in the sessions with Janice as well I can. I can clearly see right. You know, some of the things I think there are a lot of commonalities, but also a lot of nuances that you're bringing. I think the questions you are asking 104 00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:12.180 Ivy Mentors: so feel free about. You know the next session. I think that was more to give you a feel of how we typically run this 105 00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:26.249 Jenny Duan: and formalize it. Okay, I'm going to go in the background. Sorry. 106 00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:38.660 huda: Oh, I didn't really have anything to say, but I did like the connection between Cs like my game making caching. and then your production. 107 00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:54.530 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah, I think this is a really impactful angle that we can take your application forwards because it seems like right now, you have these 2 sides of your identity that you're having trouble connecting and moving forward. So you feel like, I don't know if you feel this way. But 108 00:17:54.530 --> 00:18:18.099 Jenny Duan: I know when I was doing my application, I felt like, you know, I could only present this one side of myself or schools. My only want to see this one side and not the other, and I had trouble like finding out which side to present, and I was eventually able to combine them together, which is what I hope that we can do together. But yeah, I'd love to hear some more of your thoughts on this. 109 00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:41.190 Ivy Mentors: So I do have a question right? So as I. As I said, you know, she's already actually working",
    " with the Mentor, and also, you know, from Iv mentors. And she was, see a student. And one of the reasons that we chose that mentor was primarily because of the major things. And and and you asked a very, very important question that got my engine. I'm I'm a Cs a background person as well 110 00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:53.609 Ivy Mentors: you, you said basically that you, you really try to understand who does real goal and thing that she love, which is really developing and bring bringing things to life. 111 00:18:53.740 --> 00:19:06.540 Ivy Mentors: And but definitely, I had the perception. She has a perception, and I would say, like 99% of the people that I know have this perception that oh, cs, anonymous sorry synonymous with development. 112 00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.569 Ivy Mentors: right? And and and you brought this up 113 00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:25.660 Ivy Mentors: so similarly. so thanks a lot for that. I think that really caught, and I would love to understand a bit more on. How do you prepare for that kind of a journey? because it's always been the way we have thought about it and strategize. This is, One of the reasons why the also wants to go through the humanities 114 00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:37.910 Ivy Mentors: is fundamentally like, you know, it's less competitive. So let's try the humanity angle. But we never thought about any other alternative which is like not really humanity. And I think you've opened up that doors might be there something to think about it. 115 00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:56.139 Ivy Mentors: The second thing is in terms of just a passion project, and with a very similar thinking, and I'm glad that we've got a a a validation from you as well that with that combining video and and gaming. And Cs was kind of a a good way to create a passion project. 116 00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:18.260 Ivy Mentors: And this just happened a few weeks ago to be honest, right? She was always developing game, but she was always going into this kind of and and thanks ",
    "to her dad as well, coming from that tech background like, Hey to go go deep into AI machine learning, you know, try to do crack something very deep. But then it turned out that it's really not about her expertise, and it's more so about her passion, and we were able to course correct. 117 00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:33.689 Ivy Mentors: However, one thing that fellow parent yesterday that I spoke to was actually has a daughter. he's a Columbia grad as well. When I shared my as as a parent to parent conversation, I told about the Passion project that I was following. 118 00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.070 Ivy Mentors: He basically told me that his feedback was all this is good. 119 00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:44.270 Ivy Mentors: but he doesn't see a connection of how it's actually having an impact or making a community impact. 120 00:20:44.370 --> 00:21:14.109 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is this is what I wanted to talk about next, because, looking at your extracurricular profile, it's very strong. But I think that your miss, what the component that you're missing is this element of community service and having an impact in that way because colleges, a lot of them are looking for measurable impact. And what that looks like is the number of people you can serve. The number of hours your team puts in the the scale of your network. And a lot of really strong applicants have 121 00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:29.280 Jenny Duan: this type of background. So doing, some type of community or advocacy work with whatever their passions are. And I think that we can find an intersection of community service Cs and film somewhere in this middle ground. And I think that this is the 122 00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:40.800 Jenny Duan: key element, one of the key elements that you're missing in your application. So I think we should brainstorm a bit about how we can create a plan to move forward to create this community service element. 123 00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:57.869 huda: yeah. So I was actually thinking of start",
    "ing a Youtube channel. So my community. It's kind of small. I mean, it's big, but we're tight in it and cause we're kind of far away from the 124 00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:06.389 huda: target. And like all those things. So we have lots of small businesses there. and I think it's a good opportunity. So I was thinking of 125 00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:25.969 huda: go into these small businesses and asking if I could just fill the video and like advertising them, and to build their business and then that way it would be we'd be able to present like a community impact and show that we were able to help this many small businesses and etc., 126 00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:33.140 Jenny Duan: got it. But my question for you is, how do you see this scaling over the next 2 years? Or really, just one year? 127 00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.420 huda: maybe like. 128 00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:51.550 huda: because there's a lot of small businesses. So if you're able to do like many, or we'd be able to advertise them like on Youtube publicly, so that we get lots of traction maybe if 129 00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:59.400 huda: they were able to like become viral, then that's something that could definitely scale larger throughout time. 130 00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:13.850 Jenny Duan: All right. Yeah, I think that this is something that it's a great idea, and I think it's something we should keep in the back of our minds, but also think that we're looking for something that can have a big national or international impact. And 131 00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:28.199 Jenny Duan: I'm thinking maybe you should do this. But I think, what if you created a network of other students who are sharing small business stories in their own communities. And that way we can expand the scale. So it's not just yourself, but it's having an impact on 132 00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:49.460 Jenny Duan: not only your community, but communities all around the country by building this network of people who are sharing and the project that I ju",
    "st came up with in my head is called small business stories. But obviously, you can change whatever tagline you want to do. for that cause. But do you see this distinction between having a local community impact versus being able to expand it to a national thing? 133 00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.489 huda: yeah. So like in this, would we? 134 00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:11.669 huda: How do we like to spend it? Because if, say, our asks like in a different state, or whatever And she shows like small businesses stories when we like film it and post on Youtube or 135 00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:22.010 huda: or would she be like a filmmaker? And then she could zoom, and we could just have people from around the world making these videos. 136 00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:40.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So there's a couple of ways I see that can do this. So the first the first option is a Youtube channel. And you can create playlist for the different cities, or perhaps the different states that you're making videos for. And the second option is to create a website. Do you have any experience in web development? 137 00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:48.169 huda: Yeah, I've made several websites in the past, and I made one for my community, actually for 138 00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:59.549 huda: because there was a job loss, happening. And During that time we made like a website. And we tried to help people with their job. Us. 139 00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:29.269 Jenny Duan: yeah, so I think this is a really great idea and option to combine your passion for computer science, but also your passion for film. So what if you created a website? And the interface could be like a map or some type of map feature? And then in every single city you could have, like a collection of videos that other people are making demonstrating the small businesses in their area. So it'd be kind of like a small business locator or a small business network where you tell the stories of the businesses in those areas. 140 00:25:30.190 --> 00:25",
    ":33.370 Jenny Duan: What do you think about that? I think that's a really good idea. 141 00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:56.169 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And I think that this is really cool, because once you have the website up, maybe you can have a submission portal and some guidelines for submission. You can say, like, the video is 3 to 5 min long. people. You can give them a set of guidelines like here is how you can shoot the video. Here's how to get resources. And then people can just submit it on their own. And it'll just link to your website, and that would be really cool because 142 00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:13.169 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if you've seen those videos or those maps where it's like a ton of strangers submit letters or content, but I think, being able to see that would be really cool, to have, like a set of maybe like 10 countries represented 20 countries represented, or like 30 States, or something like that. And just see that 143 00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:19.160 huda: you think originally, I can like, go on red it, and try to get people to 144 00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:27.680 huda: It's like, Submit their posts on the website. Like, do you think it's a good idea to reach out in the beginning? 145 00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:37.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So the let's talk about scaling, because this is really important. How do we get this from idea to action? And I think that 146 00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:56.320 Jenny Duan: posting on Reddit is going to be kind of a black box, and that people will not necessarily respond unless they know specifically what you're doing and who you are, because Reddit is this anonymous platform. It's also it can be some dangerous content on there. So I would probably not advice starting out with Reddit. I would probably try to get your story out on social media. And 147 00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:17.080 Jenny Duan: I think starting by making the website and filming a couple of these videos for yourself as example videos. And then once you have that star",
    "t building a team because you already have experience leading a club in the Vfx Club, I would try to get a couple of people to work with you and eventually bring this to nonprofit status, which means Get it registered as a 148 00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:31.109 Jenny Duan: 50351 nonprofit, and we can talk about how to do that in the future. But I think, starting out building some type of organization club where you're in a leadership position. And you're able to have other people helping you. 149 00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:57.050 Jenny Duan: make the videos edit the videos and things like that that way. You're not doing it all on your own, because it is quite kind of a large project, especially at scale. And then a way that you can advertise this is, are you familiar with slack discord? Geneva messaging channels? Yeah, I would try to get the word out on college specific channels. And we can talk about. You know what specific channels to target, but getting the word out there. So I think, first 150 00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.979 Jenny Duan: starting your project. So making 151 00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:08.329 Jenny Duan: sort of a document, talking about exactly what you want to achieve with the project, some measurable goals as well as you trying to start working on your website and 152 00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:20.830 Jenny Duan: well, at the same time getting the word out about your project. So that would include making a couple of videos, perhaps starting a social media account to promote your page and then blasting it in those slack discord, Geneva channels. So 153 00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:33.349 Jenny Duan: I know that's a lot. But let's walk through the steps one by one. So first create at least one video, because you want to have a demo or some type of example to show the other people who will be creating their videos. 154 00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.429 Jenny Duan: does that make sense. Yeah. So that's step one, create the first video 155 00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.910 Jenny Dua",
    "n: step 2, 156 00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:49.970 Jenny Duan: another act. The second action item is to start working on and designing the website. So you said, you have experience designing and building websites. Right? 157 00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.699 Jenny Duan: So step 2 158 00:28:51.720 --> 00:29:05.260 Jenny Duan: is to think about the website, what kind of features you want on the website and start building that I'd imagine the website will be one of the more time consuming spots in this whole activity flow so that will take up a little bit more time. 159 00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:30.520 Jenny Duan: So you want to start it early. So that's step 2. And then the third step is to start a social media page and start promoting your content. And people love stories. You're a natural storyteller. You're, you know, a coder. You make videos. You're good at telling stories. This is what you do. So try to get your story out on social media blast. In those Whatsapp channels on Instagram, on Facebook, you can create a page. You know. 160 00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:53.780 Jenny Duan: Instagram Handle. Whatever your project is called, you pick the name and then say, Introduce yourself, be like, Hi, I'm Huda. I'm making this. I'm doing this video project talking about small businesses in the community and try to grow your Instagram following that way. People are organically looking at your content. And they're thinking about it. So so that way, when you have a call to action, so step 3 social media channels. 161 00:29:53.780 --> 00:30:06.000 Jenny Duan: Step 4 will be to finish everything on your website and start your call to action. When I say, call to action. That's the actual ask of getting people to submit their videos to you. And 162 00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:30.060 Jenny Duan: again, you can do this on social media. Hopefully, you'll have a small following by this time, like on your social media, you can show like behind the scenes you're filming, you editing the website, your whol",
    "e entire process. And hopefully, people will feel inspired enough to start creating their own content. And so that fourth step. So 1, 2, 3, 4 is the call to action, and where people are uploading their videos. And once you do that sort of in the background while you're doing all these 4 steps. 163 00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:37.849 Jenny Duan: If you feel like you need extra help. That's reaching out to people editing the videos making the website, you can start building a team with you as a leader. 164 00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:47.049 huda: Does that sort of process make sense? Yeah, for sure. And then this is like really specific information. I really like it. yeah. 165 00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.280 huda: so 166 00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.629 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's really a good idea. Thank you. 167 00:30:51.750 --> 00:31:01.519 Ivy Mentors: Hi, again, thanks a lot. Jenny. I think this is really very, very helpful. And this is like more like You know, as the dad here. 168 00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:16.029 Ivy Mentors: you know, one of the things that I'm seeing who that kind of struggle with like, I am super confident, about her skills in terms of both creativity. And and you know, analytical skills of development and problem solving with Cs 169 00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:31.360 Ivy Mentors: the challenges again, like going back to last point on her kind of style. She's a very kind of reserve, and very different than you know probably her dad and also her sister, like older sister, is like more 170 00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.629 Ivy Mentors: you know, outgoing, and who dies more like an inter work right? 171 00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.319 Ivy Mentors: And so there are certain things that we discuss at home as well. 172 00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:58.080 Ivy Mentors: and and she develops a lot of amazing things. But one of the barriers that that has, I would say, as a that at least I feel like she's pretty much within her kind of well, right like her own world. She's sometimes like I look",
    " at her product that she's developing. It amazes me. And even like the other mentor 173 00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.249 Ivy Mentors: she's amazed with it as well. 174 00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.790 Ivy Mentors: The problem, however, is 175 00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.829 Ivy Mentors: like video as an example. 176 00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:28.249 Ivy Mentors: like Huda, something's holding her back. I I think there is a a different aspect of this right that she has this video. She has created this amazing thing. But she's really shy to go out there while you don't have. She has a younger brother who's 7 year old. But I'm not fair, but he's very much like an outgoing guy, and he has, like 1,000 of followers already in Youtube. He's an animator. 177 00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:43.449 Ivy Mentors: So I think there is something that's holding our back. And I would love to also that. And and I would love, you know, because, Jenny is your mentor here, I would love to also share your struggle like, just go a bit slow on. These are the execution step. But what are the some of the challenges and barriers that you have? 178 00:32:43.650 --> 00:33:02.680 Ivy Mentors: Right? That you've started a Youtube channel. But you're not able to, you know, come out more strongly. And even like you'd be. you know you have this team. I I I you know I'm seeing that you're not able to not because of your lack of skills or abilities. But I feel there's something lagging there. You wanna get some advice on that. Sorry. 179 00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:11.960 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah. I think that one thing that I talk about that, I think, is really important is you don't. 180 00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:21.530 Jenny Duan: The point is not just to do a bunch of things and get into a good school because you're obviously smart. You're capable, and you know that you can get into a good school. 181 00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:37.570 Jenny Duan: if you put effort in. But the point is to become the type of person that would go to ",
    "the type of school that you're looking for. And so I'm wondering, like within yourself, what do you feel like? Is holding you back from getting to that next level? 182 00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:47.979 Jenny Duan: Do you think it's a component of your extra particulars. Do you think that it's you know your confidence? What do you think? Are you able to identify the aspects of yourself that you feel like? 183 00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.619 Jenny Duan: you would want to work on. 184 00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.150 huda: Yeah, so definitely, 185 00:33:54.510 --> 00:34:18.060 huda: my dad knows this. But it's not. It's like kind of drive is kind of my issue, and a lot of the time. If I'm given like what I'm supposed supposed to be doing, I'll do it, and like I'll do it well. But I just it's hard to find like opportunities. For example, I started a Youtube channel like 2 days ago, and I posted a video and 186 00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:30.090 huda: well, like, I guess I can't really find like ideas to post and kind of like creator like filmmakers block kind of. And 187 00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.169 huda: I just don't know what to do most of the time. 188 00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.910 huda: And yeah, so I think that's like my main issue. But other than that, like. 189 00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:52.720 huda: I think being quiet is one of my biggest disadvantages because it's hard to collaborate with students at school since a lot of time. I'll be quiet, and I don't really talk to that. Many people. And 190 00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.669 huda: it's hard to find like people to collaborate. For example, on this project. 191 00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:14.029 huda: with the community. small businesses project. I think it might be hard finding a team here in Mount House where I live. And I think it might be tough, because there's not that many driven people at my school and 192 00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.129 huda: I don't talk to many people, and I think that might be a big issue. 193 00:35:20.260 -",
    "-> 00:35:21.600 Jenny Duan: Totally. Yeah. 194 00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:29.589 Jenny Duan: So you said that you've done, or I think your dad's mentioned that you've done a couple of hackathons in the past. 195 00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:36.280 Jenny Duan: What any of your hackathon teammates be interested in collaborating with you again on maybe developing the website and being on this team. 196 00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:51.420 huda: Yeah, for sure, I think a lot of my Hackathon teammates were online. And they were like, college students. So maybe I could ask them for help, since they probably know more. and yeah. 197 00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.289 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then another thing that we can do is to have Linkedin. 198 00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:56.320 huda: Yeah. 199 00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:22.589 Jenny Duan: you should. You can advertise on Linkedin. I think it's one of the greatest ways to reach other like pre-professional or students, you want to make an impact. And so maybe if you bake a Linkedin post that's like a call to action calling people to join your team, offer a leadership position. They can be like, maybe head of marketing, or whatever positions you think you would need support with. I think people will be willing to support if you do an online call to action, too. 200 00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.740 huda: Yeah. 201 00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.450 Jenny Duan: awesome. Go ahead. 202 00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.029 huda: No, that's that's oh. 203 00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:34.750 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then I think I want to challenge you to one thing. 204 00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:40.709 Jenny Duan: But before we go into that challenge, I'm curious if you can walk me through what a day in your life looks like? 205 00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.850 Jenny Duan: Obviously. So it's a bit different. 206 00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:52.119 huda: So during the summer wait, do you want me to describe a summer day, or like a school day. Let's do go. 207 00:36:52.300 --> 00:37:07.669 huda: O",
    "kay. So for summer, usually I wake up. I And then I start. I kind of like rest, for, like the first few hours of the day, and then then I'll start working on my video game. 208 00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:09.250 huda: and after that. 209 00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:35.569 huda: like after I make like an accomplishment, for example, like a segment of the game. maybe I'll start practicing for the sat since I'm taking in October. So I'd like just some messy practice and it's kind of laid back at the moment, because there's not. I don't know exactly what to do, but I've been trying to do some research. But yes, kind of it. 210 00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:41.280 huda: And then for during the school week I probably 211 00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.850 huda: wake up, go to school and then come back and then 212 00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.210 get started on my homework. 213 00:37:48.550 --> 00:38:01.010 huda: honestly, with, last year I didn't really work on anything extracurricular, I mean, I did work on on like clubs and whatnot. But 214 00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.680 huda: I was pretty much about it. 215 00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:12.799 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. I think that one thing that we can work on together is building a structure to your days, both in the summer and in school, because 216 00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:37.089 Jenny Duan: I know that this is a really challenging thing for many students to figure out how they utilize their time. But I think building a structure to that. You know. Figure out how much time you're going to spend studying how much time you're going to spend working on your projects. Extracurriculars planning ahead can be a really useful way to not only improve your confidence in yourself, but also make time to build all of these exciting projects that we've talked about together. 217 00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.050 Jenny Duan: what do you think about that? 218 00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:48.840 huda: Yeah, definitely, that could be really helpful, because I am missing loss o",
    "f structure. And yeah, I'll definitely help you get a lot more done. 219 00:38:49.210 --> 00:39:15.890 Jenny Duan: All right. So I'll put a bookmark in that, and we can come back to do that maybe later in the session or another time if we run out of time. But I think now let's do a deep dive into your extracurriculars, because I think that was what we wanted to talk about today. and I'm curious about what you feel, how you feel about journalism, because I know that we've talked about storytelling both with code, with film. And I'm wondering 220 00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:30.560 Jenny Duan: how you how you feel about journalism versus film, because those are 2 pretty similar, but different subject groups or academic majors that you can apply for like journalism versus film. And are you familiar with the difference. And have you thought about it at all? 221 00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:39.030 huda: I haven't really thought about journalism, this is more like a literary thing, I believe and 222 00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:45.639 huda: I know. That's like, Get you jobs that like newspapers and articles and magazines. 223 00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:58.230 huda: whereas I'm kind of a visual storyteller, and I like to tell my stories to Previously, I've done video games, short films, music, videos, I and if we like 224 00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.659 huda: to showing things 225 00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.429 huda: visually. But I do think writing is something that I do enjoy. But 226 00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.929 huda: I I enjoy from making a lot more. 227 00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:25.040 Jenny Duan: I'm asking, because I know within journalism there's a niche for like photo journalism and video journalism like video essays. that are really popular now. And another thing is also data visualization. I don't know if you've looked into this at all. are you familiar with that? 228 00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.649 huda: I think it's a branch of like, 229 00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.389 huda: AI and machine ",
    "learning right? 230 00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:58.309 Jenny Duan: Yeah, kind of. So it's, how do? How do we draw graphs and identify patterns through data? For example, data journalism was really important during the pandemic, when the New York Times is releasing graphs about like you know how many people were infected in a certain area, or how fast infections were spreading. So I'm not sure how interested you are in data. But I know that this is another way. We can maybe combine storytelling and computer science in another way. 231 00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.900 Jenny Duan: I bring this up also because Stanford has a major called data science and social systems. 232 00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:33.160 Jenny Duan: which is about how we apply data science to address different things like small businesses like small businesses, not having enough business, or like public health, epidemics, and other things. So I think that could be a really interesting intersection, especially since earlier you mentioned. You're taking? you, your, your school has economics. And was it public policy? I forget what? The other class? political science, yeah, economics and political science, so that could be something that you can talk about and explore. 233 00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.220 Jenny Duan: And 234 00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:45.380 Jenny Duan: so I also bring that up, because, as we're looking towards next summer and working on your extracurriculars. some of our programs are a big part of that. And there are a lot of 235 00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:52.019 Jenny Duan: journalism summer program set. You might want to consider applying for in case that in case you're interested in 236 00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:56.310 Jenny Duan: more of that visual storytelling aspect of journalism. 237 00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:21.069 Jenny Duan: yeah. And going back to summer summers, especially this summer and next summer, are really really important times to have a story about what you're doing or how you spend your time.",
    " Because Stanford, specifically, I know, has a question on their application that asks, how did you spend your past 2 summers? So you want to be able to in just one or 2 sentences have a clear idea about what you're doing this summer and next summer. 238 00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:41.260 Jenny Duan: So because that starts this summer, I think that just highlights. How important it is to maybe start your projects. Whether that's the Youtube channel, the the small business idea or something different. If you decide that you don't want to do either of those things, starting it this summer, because Stanford will ask you about that. What you're doing this summer on their application 2 years later. 239 00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:49.750 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, so sorry to interrupt here. I think it's a it's a very critical point, and it makes me quite anxious and nervous as a dad as well. 240 00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.779 Ivy Mentors: clearly, you know. 241 00:42:53.260 --> 00:43:05.229 Ivy Mentors: I I'm not as educated in into the process of thanks. A lot of sharing the whole reasoning behind. Why you are asking this question as well, and you kind of trying to map it to the college admission process that really helps 242 00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:16.249 Ivy Mentors: so one of the things I definitely know, like many of the parents, that summers are important, and there are a bunch of options that we are thrown with right. And I had my like older daughter. 243 00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.360 Ivy Mentors: you know. 244 00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:45.120 Ivy Mentors: we have basically made our join like so many programs and summer sessions, including the one in Stanford as well, and we that those things were not as impactful. It didn't really help much, and this time for that I didn't want to do that. So in terms of this particular summer the whole idea was to really help her work with these. you know, Iv mentors. And you know, doing this. This was the main goal that I I started this engagement wi",
    "th, I, we mentors. And 245 00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:58.009 Ivy Mentors: the other Mito, basically, you know, did a very similar kind of a thorough assessment. And one of the things that came out was really to build start building a passion project. However, one of the that the point of view that you know she had basically was 246 00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:13.610 Ivy Mentors: to work, you know, towards a competitive program like Launch X. So the whole story was, okay. You know you don't have to do 100 things. But let's just build something very concrete and and that's the engagement the sugar is in with that particular mentor 247 00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:22.550 Ivy Mentors: and the planning and and the brainstorming and the strategization at the project that she's working on actually came out of that But 248 00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:36.129 Ivy Mentors: so I think this is where and and it's very interesting, because the thing that was also missing and concerning me from that was like, we're probably putting all our eggs in one basket, right? And saying that, okay, let's just focus on a competitive program, because that's your ticket to Iv. 249 00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:49.999 Ivy Mentors: now, you basically opened up you know, various aspects here. because the impact to the community. And this came not from me, but actually another dad who basically told me when you look at it, I'm glad that you basically had a similar kind of feedback. 250 00:44:50.160 --> 00:45:09.330 Ivy Mentors: So it looks like the project is much beyond the game that was making the project is actually much beyond right. It's got all the social element. It's got the awareness. And and I think this is kind of an an interesting thing, because kids and the parents don't get it for us like project, is there something unique that we have developed? 251 00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:15.239 Ivy Mentors: And If you don't show that community impact. That's not really a project, right? If I'm understanding it correct. 252 00",
    ":45:15.390 --> 00:45:20.169 Ivy Mentors: So I think, what are your thoughts on that now, and I would love to 253 00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.440 Ivy Mentors: understand. How do we now pivot 254 00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:30.740 Ivy Mentors: or leverage the same assets? And we can the really start also prioritizing our time and effort. 255 00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:46.660 Ivy Mentors: even though we are towards the end of the summer. But she spent a lot of time on building this project. So I think the other mentor, basically, was quite amazed. And she the Cs mentor, because I know that who does a good developer and coder she that she's made great progress in terms of just developing a very unique asset. 256 00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.050 Ivy Mentors: But that's a technology asset. 257 00:45:49.550 --> 00:46:04.919 Jenny Duan: But how do we really take it from here? you know? Sorry to to just like, bring up my anxiety as well. Yeah, I know as a parent it's totally understandable to be concerned about your kid, because you want the best for your future and for their future. And 258 00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:31.509 Jenny Duan: obviously they want the best for themselves, too. So totally understand where you're coming from. And I think to really answer this question. Huda, we can think about the perspective of a college admissions officer like, why do they want you to go to their school. It's because you have something to offer. It's because you can make an impact on the world. That's the really, the purpose of college is to empower young people to have impactful careers and leave impactful legacies. 259 00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:35.610 Jenny Duan: And this whole thing centers on. How are you going to make? 260 00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:56.250 Jenny Duan: How are you going to change the world in some way, and who know you're going to change the world, I can tell you that. But how are you going to do it right? And that's what these colleges are looking for. How can we, you know, bring these",
    " passionate, driven, smart young people into our school and make them something greater, and how you specifically going to do that. So that's why, when we consider this, what they're looking for is 261 00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:03.419 Jenny Duan: your pathway of impact so far. And they're trying to use that to make a guess about how you're going to make impact in the future. 262 00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:22.679 Jenny Duan: And that's why community service and that element is so important, not just, you know, to have a certain number of hours on the table, but really to make a difference through your work. And if you really like games. I think that we can pick actually for you one cause that you're well, that you're passionate about supporting. I think 263 00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:33.439 Jenny Duan: everyone has something like some cause that they're passionate about supporting. So let's identify yours. For example, for me some my application. I focus a lot on 264 00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:57.479 Jenny Duan: mental health advocacy and Asian American Pacific Islander advocacy, and like women in stem. So those were like 3 things that I was passionate about. My application was heavily centered around my advocacy, so most people don't need to have 3 things. That's just some of the things that I was passionate about. Obviously it's different for everyone. But is there in your brain one social cause that you're passionate about. If not, we can brainstorm some together. 265 00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:06.630 huda: Yeah, definitely. So I think I'm kind of passionate about women in stem, because I have face like the struggles. 266 00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:19.650 huda: totally, actually, even in my own school. And I think that's just feeling it. And in person has definitely like bought me to like want to advocate for them. 267 00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.520 huda: and I think 268 00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:32.880 huda: that's like my main advocacy. But 269 00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:47.249 huda: I guess,",
    " also advocating, for, like people who are quieter because I know, like my entire life, I've kind of been like a bit quiet, so it has definitely affected me. So maybe that's something that I can advocate for. 270 00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:58.130 Jenny Duan: yeah, I have a great and I have an idea for you. But first I want to hear about this game that you created. Can you tell me a bit about it? 271 00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:22.029 huda: Yeah. So basically. it's a view game like an rpg, where this? It's kind of storytelling game, where basically, there's this middle Schooler girl, and she has to an older sister who knows a lot about machine learning, but she doesn't know anything yet. And basically her town runs on this AI robot 272 00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:34.140 huda: and most of the things are generated by the AI and everything like that. But then One day it just goes rogue, and then it goes like And then it starts doing all these crazy things like 273 00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:53.269 huda: like messing up the research lab or the trees start like turning into different objects. And then the object of the game is to basically find the AI, and then, while you're while you're like looking for the AI you learn different things about it like. 274 00:49:53.270 --> 00:50:19.200 huda: Oh, this is a this is a classification model. And AI and yeah, like, you learn different parts of AI, and then at the end, there's going to be like kind of like a boss fight where you have to. D. Why, the robot, using all these things that you know about AI like Oh, we should use classification model for this. And you should use this model for that 275 00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.019 huda: in. Yeah. 276 00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:34.129 huda: this is amazing, amazing. Can I see the game? Do you have a link to it. it's not fully developed yet, but and I haven't released it. But some of the makes and I I do have like clips of they can play, though 277 00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:39.420 Jenny Duan: this is amazing. ",
    "Have you heard about the concept of AI ethics or AI bias? 278 00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.610 huda: I've heard of a bias for? Yeah. 279 00:50:43.950 --> 00:51:11.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that this, no, this is perfect. I why didn't you tell me about this earlier? This is amazing. I think we can really frame this game, to connect your passion for women in stem and social advocacy by framing it as a game that empowers young female coders to learn about the ethical and social impacts of AI, because this is a huge issue on people's minds, especially within big tech. Within these schools, who 280 00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:22.549 Jenny Duan: are especially Stanford. I know, because I go there. They're huge on AI ethics, AI bias. And they're actively developing programs to support people who are passionate about this. So 281 00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:48.099 Jenny Duan: another strategy that we can use in looking at colleges is seeing what types of programs they're supporting and how much they're funding these programs, because that gives you a glimpse about. You know whether or not they want more people in these programs, whether or not they want less. And I know at Stanford personally, they are funding a lot of AI Ethics departments, the data science and social systems major is brand new. They have a lot of money in that program, which means they're recruiting students for that program. And they really want people to be in that program. 282 00:51:48.580 --> 00:52:07.950 Jenny Duan: So this is where you you come in, I think, talk, framing the scheme as a way to talk about AI education. AI bias, female empowerment and stem is really really powerful, and I want you to win an award for this. So one thing I'm thinking about is One specific thing that you should apply for is 283 00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:16.209 Jenny Duan: Ncw, it. Have you heard about this program. no. I'm gonna send it in the oh, I'm gonna send it to you in the chat. 284 00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:29.050 Jenny Duan: An",
    "d this is a network of women in Technology National Center for Women and Information Technology, and they offer an award called the Aspirations and Computing award. And 285 00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:51.469 Jenny Duan: I want to help you win this award. This is both a national award. So it's a national award. But they also have levels at the regional and state level, which means that you have plenty of opportunities to win, and I was in a I was a recipient of this award in high school, and it's I think it's really a great program for you to 286 00:52:51.840 --> 00:53:13.130 Jenny Duan: gain some recognition for the game that you've been developing, as well as for your passion in techn for technology. And when applications come out in the fall. I've won this award twice, so I've won the National Honorable mentioned, and also the State winner. Twice you can apply for multiple times. So I'm pretty familiar with how this works, and I'd love to help you apply for this specific award. 287 00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:16.040 Another thing that I think you can 288 00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.279 Jenny Duan: you should think about is, have you? Are you involved with Hat Club at all? 289 00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.979 huda: I don't think they have that at our school. 290 00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:31.680 Jenny Duan: Okay, that club is a national organization. let me just send it to you, and they run hackathons that are 291 00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:34.099 Jenny Duan: free to participate in, and 292 00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:43.590 Jenny Duan: they give awards for every single hackathon. So this is something that you should do, because you said you've already participated at Hackathon in the past. Right? 293 00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.280 huda: Yeah. 294 00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:48.090 Jenny Duan: Have you won any awards at hackathons? 295 00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:55.410 huda: I've got an honorable mention from like a couple in a place. Top 5 and some. Yeah. 296 00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:59.209 Jenny Duan: ",
    "that's amazing. I think you should register for Hat Club, because I think it's 297 00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:21.980 Jenny Duan: literally the number one best community for young people interested in coding right now. My sister is in Vermont at a Hat Club conference, and they flew her out to participate in that hackathon. They have this every single summer. Last summer she was at the I do know what figma is. She's at the Figma headquarters at ha! At a hat club hackathon. So I think you should get involved in a hat club asap. 298 00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:25.519 Jenny Duan: and I also think, have you ever thought about starting your own hackathon? 299 00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:29.169 huda: Yes, I was actually thinking of that. But 300 00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:43.530 huda: They have a hackathon club at our school. And it's kind of it's like really rigged, and it's like a terrible club. But they do like a annual hackathon at the school, so I don't know if I could. 301 00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:47.600 huda: Should I just do it like independently or at the school? 302 00:54:48.190 --> 00:55:08.359 Jenny Duan: I think. What if you said that your Your school is in is a public school, and it's like there's not a lot of big businesses around your school. Is that sort of the area? Yeah, I think, what if you did a virtual hackathon you didn't have, you don't have to do in person. What if you did a virtual one, so that people from all over the world can join. 303 00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.890 huda: Yeah, it's a good idea. I think I could. 304 00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:23.690 Jenny Duan: So on up. Yeah. And you can make this hackathon, you know, you can set the theme for your hackathon. They can be about maybe game development. It could be a game development hackathon, but I think what would be really powerful is, if you did 305 00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:33.410 Jenny Duan: like a tech ethics hackathon like an like a AI ethics or AI hackathon, and if you made it all women, I think that would be reall",
    "y powerful 306 00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:59.060 Jenny Duan: sure. And then, we can build this hackathon together. I can help bring in mentors and help you with that. But what looks like at a hackathon is. It's about one day or a weekend, I mean, you've done it. So you know of coding, but you can also have speakers come in and since I go to school in the barrier, and your dad is also involved in tech. I'm sure we can bring in some really cool women speakers to come and talk about their jobs, their roles. We can bring in speakers. 307 00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:27.590 Jenny Duan: You can host workshop sessions that you could teach people how you develop a game. How you develop a game, you know, have different mentorship and also workshop sessions during your hackathon. So hosting a virtual hackathon could also be a really, really fun thing to do. And if you're concerned about, you know the club being rigged, I know how club culture works, I know, like extremely frustrating. So having a virtual means that anyone can join. So you're not limited to your geographic area, especially with it being a smaller area. 308 00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.730 Jenny Duan: I would think so much. Yeah, I would look into that. 309 00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:48.590 Jenny Duan: And then I think that the one something else that we wanted to talk a little bit about was your passion for film, and I know one of the original reasons why I'm having this conversation with you, in the first place, is to look at what kinds of film festivals or programs you can apply for right 310 00:56:49.900 --> 00:57:00.340 Jenny Duan: right so i'm going to give you a couple ideas right now and we're going to talk about them together. So does your school have a National History day 311 00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:05.080 Jenny Duan: club or an Nhd. Organization. I'm putting the links in the chat as I speak. 312 00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.569 huda: no, I don't think so. 313 00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:25.790 Jenny Duan: Okay, so I think th",
    "is is one thing that you can think about doing. It's called national History Date. And what you're doing is you're making documentary film. So one of the one of the categories is film. So you're making a short documentary film about a historical story or a 314 00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:30.509 Jenny Duan: something in history that was impactful. So 315 00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:34.849 Jenny Duan: are you interested in history at all? If not, we can move on. But 316 00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:38.110 Jenny Duan: it is pretty fascinating. Yeah. 317 00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 318 00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:55.370 Jenny Duan: I think one of the things that I have a friend who won the national competition a couple of years ago, and the video that he made was about this battle at over, like native American tribal land in Oregon, and it was something that people don't really talk about, and was pretty like 319 00:57:55.370 --> 00:58:07.019 Jenny Duan: under represented in historian and media. So one thing that I'm thinking that you can maybe make a video about is a short documentary about like women in stem in some regard 320 00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:30.250 Jenny Duan: like, have you seen hidden figures? That's like about the story of the NASA astronauts. But what if you found something similar that you can talk about within computer science, like a famous computer science female role model that you know people don't talk about. And you can make a video about her story and submit it for national history day. I think that would be super super cool. And this is something that you can do throughout the school year. 321 00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:35.810 Jenny Duan: And you can create this video. But I'm pretty sure this 322 00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:43.739 Jenny Duan: you you would have to talk to a teacher to have them organize like a club or a 323 00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:51.299 Jenny Duan: affiliation. So that you're able to. So you're able to enter. So actually, right now, I'",
    "m gonna look up your local contest. 324 00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:54.380 Jenny Duan: okay. 325 00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.119 Jenny Duan: I'm going to 326 00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:11.450 Jenny Duan: send you some information about the affiliate coordinator. So to get started on national history day. And I'm sorry I don't have access to the dog. I don't have editing access to the document, but I can just put it in the chat again. 327 00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:17.220 Jenny Duan: so let me just request that access? 328 00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:25.429 Jenny Duan: one specific thing that you can do if you are interested in national history, day is to reach out to 329 00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.590 Jenny Duan: these people. 330 00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:33.090 Jenny Duan: give me 1 s to put their information in the chat. 331 00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:42.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think I just got 332 00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:46.480 Jenny Duan: let me just put that in the chat. 333 00:59:49.830 --> 01:00:08.949 Jenny Duan: So this is the the thing I just put in the document is the information for the local contest director. So it's a scrollable map, and you can go to California, which is the state you're in, and in the Sacramento Bay area there's 2 people, Craig, Irish, and Whitney Olsen, and right after we do this call. 334 01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:17.340 Jenny Duan: we should, you should send them an email asking how you can get involved in California with this competition if you're interested in pursuing this. 335 01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:22.550 Jenny Duan: And I think you should email them. Even if you're not just so, you can learn more about the program. 336 01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:42.110 Jenny Duan: And then another thing that I want you to look into is young arts. And this is a specific film competition. It's a national competition. If you win, you get to have your art displayed in the Us. Capital. So that's really exciting. You can have your film displayed there. It's called A Young Arts and ",
    "337 01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:55.139 Jenny Duan: it's in artistic competition that I've just at you the film, the film contest. But you can submit for narrative, documentary, experimental and animation filmmaking. 338 01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:57.290 Jenny Duan: So actually. 339 01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:15.279 Jenny Duan: right after this call, I'm going to make a to do list of like action items after this call. But on the action items list is going to be to sign up for the 2024 young Arts application update. So it's for people in grades 10 to 12. So age 15 to 18, so perfect for you and 340 01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:20.940 Jenny Duan: you can submit a film or documentary to young arts. So 341 01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:23.589 huda: yeah, that's nice. 342 01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:28.840 huda: do you think this competition is competitive? 343 01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:33.839 Jenny Duan: It is definitely competitive. but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't apply 344 01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:53.260 Jenny Duan: because the young arts winners. They also are eligible for presidential scholars in the arts awards, which is a really big accomplishment. So I think that you know, just because something is competitive that shouldn't dissuade you from applying. Obviously, some things are going to be more competitive. Some things that we talk about might be easier to get into. But 345 01:01:53.450 --> 01:02:11.699 Jenny Duan: I think that if you hone your craft and you apply, you have a really good shot of making it, and you shouldn't limit yourself by saying, Oh, is competitive. I shouldn't apply. No, you are capable. You're talented, and you should apply. And the worst case, the worst thing that happens is you try again next year, and that's not that bad, or you apply for something different. 346 01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:30.050 Jenny Duan: So I think one strategy that we're using right now is applying to as many things as possible, because if you apply for more things, and you can probably submit the ",
    "same content for these different competitions as well. You have a greater chance of winning at least one of them. So that's a strategy that we can talk about. 347 01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.310 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 348 01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:38.659 Jenny Duan: okay, great. And then 349 01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:51.559 Jenny Duan: another thing that you can apply for is Now we're getting into a different category, which I think this is another niche you can really work on. It's science communication. Have you ever heard about this? 350 01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:55.710 Jenny Duan: strategy at all? Science communication? 351 01:02:55.970 --> 01:03:22.229 Jenny Duan: So science communication is like making videos that explain science concepts to young younger audiences, or taking, be able to take a complex idea like what you did in your game and turn it into something that anyone can understand. And there's a couple of scholarships and competitions that I think we can enter in this in this category. So the first thing is the breakthrough. Junior challenge. Have you heard about this? 352 01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.390 huda: No, I don't think so. 353 01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:28.549 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So this is a 354 01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.510 Jenny Duan: Let me put it in the chat. 355 01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:48.579 Jenny Duan: This is a competition about science communication, and this is a very, very prestigious award. So it's hard to win. But actually, I have a friend at Stanford who won it. And it's open to people worldwide. And you're making a 356 01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:53.649 Jenny Duan: video explaining a concept in like a short amount of time. That's that's it. 357 01:03:53.990 --> 01:04:02.449 Jenny Duan: So let me show you the video of that, my friend, one, it's a 3 min long video. And you're explaining a 358 01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:11.810 Jenny Duan: yeah, a concept in a short amount time. So maybe if I found you this video, we can watch it together. So you can get a sen",
    "se of what I'm talking about. 359 01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:19.380 Jenny Duan: And if you just want to click the link. You can watch like 10 s of it. You don't have to watch the whole thing. 360 01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:30.549 Jenny Duan: So just you can get a sense, it's it's not a very technical or hard concept. It's about taking something big and making it telling a story from it, making it understandable. 361 01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.450 huda: Yeah. 362 01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.160 Jenny Duan: is it like, strictly like science based? yes, it is. It is 363 01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.520 huda: okay. 364 01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:39.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 365 01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:44.989 Jenny Duan: so are you watching the video? Have you seen it? 366 01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.099 huda: Because it did this show you? 367 01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:56.779 Jenny Duan: it's the one I just put in the chat. 368 01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:02.720 Jenny Duan: It's just like amber, Mauritius physics. Winter 21 breakthrough challenge. 369 01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:13.870 huda: Yeah. Okay? I also added to the document, just you are able to edit the document. Now, right? 370 01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:27.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I am. I can. I should, to add it in the document. Then we'll be able to like, you know. So yeah, perfect. Anyways, this, it's only a 3 min long video. It's about Van der Waals forces. and something of 371 01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:33.969 Jenny Duan: physics related. So you can make one about computer science. And I think that would be really, really powerful. 372 01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:38.760 Jenny Duan: Another thing that I'm going to put in the chat, and this is something that we can hold on 373 01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:43.390 Jenny Duan: to until senior year. But it's called the Science Ambassador, scholarship. 374 01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:45.520 Jenny Duan: and 375 01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:56.199 Jenny Duan: If you win it, you get a full, full ride to college. But again, it's a 3 mi",
    "n video on a science topic. And I think talking about AI would personally be really interesting. 376 01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:07.690 Jenny Duan: So that's another thing. But this for the Science Ambassador scholarship that I just put. We can hold off on that until your senior year, because it's only open to incoming freshmen and college students. So 377 01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:15.329 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's something we can apply for right now. But I'm trying to give you a sense of the opportunities that are available in terms of science communication videos 378 01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.729 huda: yeah, it sounds great. 379 01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:32.379 Jenny Duan: So those are some specific things that you can apply for, have you? I think that a film festival is going to be a little bit difficult, because actually, can you tell me what type of film you're interested in, like, what type of films do you like to make? 380 01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:45.589 huda: So honestly, I just, I kinda like making anything but I'd say, like my main favorite kinds of film is like movies, like short films. 381 01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:51.860 huda: music videos. I made a music video before. And I really enjoyed it. I like 382 01:06:51.880 --> 01:07:00.350 huda: making like, I'm fine. I'm making documentaries, but I'm not that great at it. But I could definitely like work on it. But 383 01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:03.490 huda: yeah, and you anything like? 384 01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:09.559 huda: Sure? Because I feel like editing long videos is not really like my strength. 385 01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:15.680 huda: And of what I think vlogs is also like. pretty interesting to me. 386 01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:28.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's awesome. and I think that one thing you should look into I think you should apply for this program, even if you're not that interested in journalism. 387 01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:37.210 Jenny Duan: So it's called Jcamp. I'm gonna the link is in the document. Do you",
    " have access to the document? Or would you prefer to putting things in the chat. 388 01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.650 huda: I have access to it. 389 01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:50.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think you should look at this. It's called the Asian American Journalism Association, and they have a summer program. It's only 6 days long. So it's not going to take up your whole summer. You have the option to do other things with your summer next year. 390 01:07:50.770 --> 01:08:00.470 Jenny Duan: but it's very prestigious and it's a good foundation for people who are interested in storytelling, including visual storytelling. So 391 01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:13.659 Jenny Duan: on the page. It says, select a students demonstrate a keen interest in broadcasting newspaper, magazine, photo journalism or an online media. So I would say that you should definitely apply for this program. And 392 01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:26.510 Jenny Duan: the people who have done this are really, really impactful. for example, like speakers that come are like the co-host of the today show Former publishers of the New York Times. 393 01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:44.569 Jenny Duan: people from Cbs news. And all these big news organizations come. So it's a really good way to explore connecting with those powerful people in the media which you know could be an industry that you're interested in working with and also getting into a prestigious summer program. And the reason why summer programs are important is because. 394 01:08:45.170 --> 01:09:08.439 Jenny Duan: first of all, it's a good practice for applying to college, just because you'll have to write essays and do things for that. But also some of our programs function as an award, when you get into a procedure summer program, that's basically an award that's saying, like, you are qualified enough to do this. So other people might like a college might view you as qualified enough to attend there. does that make sense? 395 01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:19.460 Je",
    "nny Duan: So I really want to give you some specific programs to apply for. So first of all, J. Camp is a good one. I know that right now you're considering applying for Launch X. Can you tell me why you're applying for launch X, 396 01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:45.639 huda: yeah. So launch X is kind of like an entrepreneurial experience that they let students go through. And I think just like the concept of being an entrepreneur is like really interesting to me, and I think it's probably something that I want to do in the future, and I think it'll help me work with others, and also like emerge as a leader. 397 01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:52.449 Jenny Duan: Okay, if you want to be a leader, do you have to go to an entrepreneurship summer program to do that? 398 01:09:53.060 --> 01:10:02.390 huda: Well, not exactly. But it it'll definitely like, help me like learn how to become a leader. amongst others in a group. 399 01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:08.059 Jenny Duan: What's the best way to become a leader in your opinion. 400 01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:21.199 huda: I'd say, just kinda have experience. like helping others and leading them to do to help leading them to have accomplishments 401 01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:27.020 Jenny Duan: exactly, I think, to be a leader. You don't need someone to teach you how to be a leader. I think 402 01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:33.299 Jenny Duan: the big, the biggest thing to do. To be a leader is simply just be a one, lead other people. And I think that 403 01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:43.789 Jenny Duan: because the rest of your application is not that focused on entrepreneurship. It doesn't make sense, in my opinion, to spend a lot of time at an entrepreneurship Institute, because 404 01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:50.459 Jenny Duan: this isn't something that you have mentioned elsewhere in your application, and also because you can learn the same skills that you would at launch X 405 01:10:50.480 --> 01:11:11.989 Jenny Duan: in other places. For example, by doing your pass",
    "ion projects by connecting other people by leading your club. I think all this demonstrates your leadership, and you wouldn't necessarily have to like sit in classes to learn how to be a leader. Also, same thing with goes for being an entrepreneur. If you want to be an entrepreneur, you can just be one. I don't think you need to be taught how to be an entrepreneur. If you want to start a business, if you have an idea, then 406 01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:21.990 Jenny Duan: you can just build it, and same thing for collaboration, like, if you want to learn how to work with other people, you can just work with other people, I think, spending Do you know how long launch X is? 407 01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.910 huda: not exactly sure I can. And just look. 408 01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.140 Jenny Duan: let me see. 409 01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:32.100 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 410 01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:47.000 Jenny Duan: And I'm telling you this because this is something that my sister was considering, too. She's your age, too, and We eventually decided that this probably wasn't going to be a good fit for her. and I think you fall under a similar background, because. 411 01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:56.410 Jenny Duan: again, like, if you want to be an entrepreneur, you can just be an entrepreneur. You don't need to spend like 7 weeks, or however long it is to 412 01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:59.599 Jenny Duan: to be in this program, because 413 01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:12.340 Jenny Duan: oh, it's for it's 4 weeks, 4 weeks, because 4 weeks is a long part of your summer, and you need to consider, like your time is your most valuable resource, especially because we only have like a one month, one year. Sorry one year 414 01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:31.010 Jenny Duan: time before you start playing to colleges. And so what does one month look like? And what could you be able to accomplish in one month? Because if you go to launch X, then you're at lawn checks for one month, you're not going to be able to have tha",
    "t time to spend working on your other projects, or building something else which could be more valuable at that most critical part of your application process. 415 01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:56.240 Jenny Duan: So because of that, I recommend not doing Launch X. But again, it's it's up to you. this is a decision you can think about in terms of how you feel about yourself things that you're passionate with. But I would say, if you're going to apply for a summer program, we can work together to find one that's a better fit for you than long check. I'm not saying don't apply for a summer program at all. I'm just saying, if you're interested in entrepreneurship and learning how to collaborate and lead other people 416 01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:09.830 huda: the best way to do that might not be to go to camp to do that. Does that make sense? Yeah, also, in that manner. I also wanted to talk about internships, and like, how important are they in my application. 417 01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:33.600 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah, I think that internships are important because they show that you can commit to something, and that you can, that you have these intellectual skills. So whenever we consider any part of a college application, we need to think about like, why does a college want to see this? You know, for example, why does the college want to see your grades? Well, they want to know that you're prepared for the academic river of their institution. So 418 01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.349 Jenny Duan: why, what a college 419 01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:44.920 Jenny Duan: you want an internship? Well, they want you to have skills, and that you can commit to something. And are you thinking about doing internships next summer? 420 01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:48.229 Jenny Duan: Or I guess. What is the context of this question? 421 01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:52.970 huda: Yeah. So I I definitely want to do an internship next summer. But 422 01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.610 huda: it's really hard for anyone as a ",
    "high school student, and like 423 01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:08.489 huda: kind of related to what I'm doing, machine learning or computer science. It's hard to find internships. I've been trying to search online. But I I can't really find any opportunities. 424 01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:12.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah, have you considered research as at all? 425 01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:18.369 huda: yeah, actually, I tried reaching out to professors near me. 426 01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:27.630 huda: for research. But my other mentors that I should kind of put down the backbench because 427 01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:38.320 huda: it's kind of not as important, since I'm going more on the passion side of the playing, since there's like the spike in the well rounded, I'm more like the spike. So 428 01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:46.620 Jenny Duan: and what's your spike? Would you just want Like, if I'm applying this computer science? then my spike would be like my video and passion. 429 01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:51.350 huda: And if I was applying for film, it would be like my computer science passion 430 01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.130 Jenny Duan: gotcha. 431 01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:57.790 Jenny Duan: So I think that we can find maybe a way to integrate 432 01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.340 Jenny Duan: research with your other passion. So 433 01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:17.050 Jenny Duan: the reason why research is such a popular extracurricular is because it demonstrates your intellectual vitality. That's the thing about research is, it shows the college that you are capable enough and that you are 434 01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:24.280 Jenny Duan: knowledgeable enough to conduct research, which is innovation basically on a scientific level. 435 01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:29.110 Jenny Duan: and I think that 436 01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:38.360 Jenny Duan: How? How academic would you say you are like compared to other people at your school? Would you say that you're like the most academic person. Or do you feel like. 437 01:1",
    "5:39.170 --> 01:15:41.569 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how strong do you feel like your academics are? 438 01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:47.849 huda: I wouldn't say I'm like the most strong academic person at my school. But 439 01:15:47.930 --> 01:16:11.379 huda: I'm definitely like I'm willing to. I put a lot of time in school for my education, and I definitely prioritize my grades a lot and like my breaker, I think it's pretty because I'm self setting a piece. I'm doing college courses and 2 lots of Aps as well. So I feel like my academic rigor is pretty high in comparison to 440 01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.249 huda: like the majority of the school. 441 01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:16.260 Jenny Duan: How long do you spend doing homework every day. 442 01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.770 huda: last year I spent like 443 01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.730 huda: like 4 h per day, but I think it's probably going to increase because I'm taking like 4 aps 444 01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:31.930 huda: and like a college course. So yeah. 445 01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:39.860 Jenny Duan: okay, who? I'm going to be honest with you. You spend too much time on school. I know that. That's probably something that 446 01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:52.770 Jenny Duan: is, it seems very counterintuitive. Because, you know, as a student, we're told that you need to focus on school, you get good grades and all that is important. But when we think about your time, you have 24 h in a day, you're going to be at school for like 447 01:16:52.780 --> 01:17:03.570 Jenny Duan: 8 h, 6 h, 7 h. You're gonna be sleeping for 8 h hopefully. And if the rest of your remaining 8 h, if let's say, like 3 of them are spent 448 01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:06.290 Jenny Duan: going to the bathroom, you know, getting ready eating like 449 01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:14.200 Jenny Duan: no, let's say 2 h, for, like everything else, then that means you only have 6 h left right, because 8 h in school, 8 h sleeping. 450 01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.029 Jenny Duan: and 2 h like ",
    "eating transportation, going to the bathroom. All that that means 451 01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:24.329 Jenny Duan: you only have 6 h left left, and if you spend 4 of those hours 452 01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:30.559 Jenny Duan: doing homework, then you only have 2 h to work on everything else, which is not a lot of time. 453 01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:38.660 Jenny Duan: So we, I think we need to think about, how do we maximize your time and create the biggest impact in the smallest amount of time possible. 454 01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.760 Jenny Duan: So 455 01:17:42.130 --> 01:18:01.450 Jenny Duan: I think this is a really interesting area that we need to talk about in the future. But back to the research and summer program. internship conversation. I think that doing some type of research that's connected to things that you're passionate about and already working on can be a good way to spend one of your summers because 456 01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.219 Jenny Duan: I think that 457 01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:10.370 Jenny Duan: you have a really strong academic profile, but it doesn't stand out to me. 458 01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:28.949 Jenny Duan: does that make sense like you are very smart, and you have great academics. But every single applicant to these schools has great academics. No one's going to be applied to a top school with a 3.0 Gpa, right? So everything around you has great academic. So how do you make yourself stand out and show that you are 459 01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:36.409 Jenny Duan: willing to be at the academic rigor that a competitive institution like Harvard Stanford, Berkeley, Ucla would require. 460 01:18:36.410 --> 01:19:01.199 Jenny Duan: And I think research is one way to do that. And this doesn't mean pick a random research topic. It means pick something that's related to what you're already doing and what you're already passionate about. And I think one interesting area that we can explore is the use of AI in film. For example, AI generated film, AI gen",
    "erated imagery and things like that. So I think that that would be a really interesting research area to explore. 461 01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:11.429 Jenny Duan: And the re. The way that I did this is in my experience. I reached out to people at at local universities, and you said that you did some cold outreach, and it wasn't working. Can you tell me a little bit more about that. 462 01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:35.179 huda: Yeah. So at that time I didn't really like focus on film production. So I was reaching out to like computer science and AI professors at the local community college. And I did some research on them. And like, I found what studies they did and things like that. And I made like a email template. 463 01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:46.690 huda: And I would put like details of their research and things that they're interested in. But I didn't really get a response back. So yeah, 464 01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:51.119 Jenny Duan: I'm going to tell you why you didn't get a response back. And then we're going to talk about how we move forward. 465 01:19:51.130 --> 01:20:14.359 Jenny Duan: So the reason why I think you didn't get a response back is not because your emails are bad or anything. But it's because we're identifying the wrong demographic. So community college professors are very busy teaching. That is their main priority. community colleges are really great for teaching, but they don't do as much research as larger institutions like Stanford, Santa Clara. 466 01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:32.659 Jenny Duan: Those types of schools would do, and because of that they might not have a lot of time to offer you research positions, because they also don't have enough funding to support additional positions in their labs. They might be very busy again handling their teaching, because that's the priority at a community college. So I think when we think about research, we need to identify 467 01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.219 Jenny Duan: departments are aligned with what you already ",
    "do, as well as 468 01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:54.359 Jenny Duan: places that would have the funding time and opportunity to mentor you, because a lot of research, especially in high school, is not necessarily about the actual research, but it's about mentoring the student and ensuring that they're aware of how science research works, how grant funding works and all of that. So 469 01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.639 Jenny Duan: I think that's something that we can change in our target. 470 01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:20.090 Jenny Duan: And I know that we have the last 7 min of our conversation. So I really want to take this time to solidify a plan and talk about next steps. So we talked about a lot of things today. which I think each of the things we talked about could be another conversation. But let's break down the concrete steps you can take to Take some of the things that we talked about and turn them into actionable items. 471 01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:23.970 huda: does that sound good to you? 472 01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:30.910 Jenny Duan: So one thing. So the things that we talked about are summer plans. 473 01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:35.080 Jenny Duan: Time blocking 474 01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.710 Jenny Duan: had. time, blocking means, like schedule. 475 01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.880 Jenny Duan: passion projects. So this includes 476 01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:49.809 Jenny Duan: your Youtube channel the game that you're creating as well as small business idea. 477 01:21:49.900 --> 01:22:14.849 Jenny Duan: And the hackathon. Those were like a couple of the projects that we talked about. And I think that one misconception people have is that you can only have one passion project. But in reality I think you can have multiple. They could connect to each other. it doesn't have to be like. There's only one thing you're working on. If you're passionate about doing multiple things, you can do that in your own time, and we can create time in the schedule that we create to have for all of the",
    "se things. 478 01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:29.689 Jenny Duan: so passion projects. the Youtube channel, the game, the small business idea, the hackathon. those are all really powerful things in in summer plans. We talked about research. We also talked about internships, and we talked about summer programs. 479 01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.209 Jenny Duan: and then the other thing that we talked about was 480 01:22:33.710 --> 01:22:38.029 Jenny Duan: community service, and how you can integrate that with your passion projects. 481 01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:43.220 Jenny Duan: let's see, integrate with Asian projects as well as awards. 482 01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:47.569 Jenny Duan: So the ones that we talked about are signs great through 483 01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.040 Jenny Duan: science break the breakthrough, challenge 484 01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.680 Jenny Duan: science, ambassador scholarship. 485 01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:05.669 Jenny Duan: the aspirations and computing award. This is the Nc. We, one aspirations in computing. 486 01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:10.070 Jenny Duan: That's the Ncw. It. One and 487 01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:17.530 Jenny Duan: for summer programs. We talked about J. Camp, which is the Asian American Journalism Association one 488 01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:19.210 Jenny Duan: and 489 01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:30.440 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay. And then these are the things that talked about. Let me just check if there's anything else. perfect. 490 01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:33.120 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And then we also talked about like 491 01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:42.560 Jenny Duan: advocacy and impact. So I'm just going to make those small sections and moving forward. I think. Let's say, some concrete action items. 492 01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:53.710 Jenny Duan: the first auction item, I think, would be to email the national history day. people that were in the National History day, California website. 493 01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.600 Jenny Duan: So I think you should do that. I ",
    "think. Also 494 01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:01.430 Jenny Duan: sign up 495 01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.719 Jenny Duan: for the young Arts mailing list 496 01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.460 Jenny Duan: and then 497 01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:16.150 Jenny Duan: moving forward with your passion projects. I think we've identified a lot of potential ones. 498 01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:20.659 Jenny Duan: I think that our next step would be to time block. 499 01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:22.350 Jenny Duan: hey? Scheduled 500 01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.500 Jenny Duan: for each Passion Project. 501 01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:36.180 Jenny Duan: and also plan out your schedule for the next school year and then identify the key strategy for next summer. 502 01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:44.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think these are a couple of action items that I'm identifying right now. Is there anything that stands out to you that you would want to add onto that list? 503 01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:51.330 huda: maybe. 504 01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.589 huda: Yeah. I think that says it all. But maybe I can talk about 505 01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:04.900 huda: Considering journalism and 506 01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:15.960 huda: I could do more research about like the journalism field. And like different programs and different schools like you said in Stanford, they have the 507 01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.930 huda: AI bias program. 508 01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:26.480 huda: yeah, I think I could do some more research on the actual courses. 509 01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:31.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. And I'm happy to give you a list of that. 510 01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:47.870 Jenny Duan: First, I think another program that you should apply for for next summer. I'm going to write this down to. It's called Stanford AI. For all. And this is different from the Stanford Pre college program. It's a specific program for high school students that was started by Fifa Lee. Are you familiar with her? 511 01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:49.950 huda: no. 51",
    "2 01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.479 Jenny Duan: she's one of the she's one of the most impactful people at Stanford. But 513 01:25:54.590 --> 01:26:08.980 Jenny Duan: for people who do this program they do small group research projects about the social impacts of AI and how AI can be used to address our most pressing problems. So this might be a really good way to combine your passion for research, and also with that social advocacy. 514 01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:13.160 Jenny Duan: So I think this is a really standout program that we can talk about 515 01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:17.179 Jenny Duan: and apply for for sure. 516 01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:24.789 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I know that we talked about a lot of things so far. do you have any questions about 517 01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:30.670 Jenny Duan: what we're going to be working on in the future, and what ideas you might have. 518 01:26:31.050 --> 01:26:37.899 huda: Yeah. So will you be able to help me? find internship and research for next summer? 519 01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:57.660 Jenny Duan: Yes, I think that this is something specifically we can work on together, is creating a schedule that allows room for all of your passion projects and then also creating an application and game plan for next year, including a timeline of all the awards, like in internships that you're going to be applying for for next summer. So summer programs, internships and awards. 520 01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:00.840 huda: Yeah, that sounds good. 521 01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And 522 01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:14.990 Jenny Duan: with that, do you have any other questions as we wrap up anything else that you're curious about about the college application process, or any thing that I can talk about from my own experience in college that you're wondering about. 523 01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:28.999 huda: Yeah. So you said you? did a documentary in high school? How did you like come about that like? Where did you post it? What was it abou",
    "t? And how is it? Like. 524 01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:51.199 Jenny Duan: yeah, I saw, I did a short video series about the Asian American community in Chinatown during the pandemic and how that's actually impacted small businesses. So it's pretty similar to what you are thinking about doing. And it's just a Youtube series. But I think the biggest thing about that is that I was able to get a network of other students to work with me and to really expand that 525 01:27:51.200 --> 01:28:01.439 Jenny Duan: And I think that that's what made it bigger from like an individual contributor impact to having like a national or community. Why, like team player impact. 526 01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:06.809 huda: that sounds so cool? can I see that? Can I see your documentary? 527 01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:13.260 Jenny Duan: Sure. Yeah, let me just send you a link. It's not a documentary, really. It's a video series. But yeah. 528 01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.849 Jenny Duan: let me just send it to you. 529 01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:30.739 Jenny Duan: And I think one misconception is that you have to have like perfect video video skills before posting. I think the most important thing is to just get your content out there. 530 01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.109 Jenny Duan: And yeah. 531 01:28:33.150 --> 01:28:41.690 Jenny Duan: so I'm just gonna send this channel to you. The videos, like at the bottom are what I've made there. Someone else has taken over the 532 01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:52.049 Jenny Duan: someone else has taken over the channel. So they're they're posting different things now. But like the very first couple of videos are the ones that we made me and my team 533 01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.890 huda: actually cool. 534 01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 535 01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.100 Jenny Duan: well, 536 01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:13.499 Jenny Duan: so yeah, moving forward, I'd love to know what your availability is for setting up sessions. If this is something that you'd be in",
    "terested in and how we can best work together. 537 01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:32.879 huda: Yeah, definitely, I really loved. this quality, and I think it was very insightful and definitely like way more specific than anything I've ever tried. So thank you so much? And yeah, definitely, we could set up meetings like either weekly or by weekly 538 01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:37.560 huda: or not by weekly, but like 2 times a week or so like that. 539 01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:39.490 Ivy Mentors: Wow! 540 01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:48.990 Ivy Mentors: That is music to my years. Actually, and I'm actually now, you know, do you have like 50 more minutes. You know, there are multiple things I kind of want to connect. So 541 01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.600 Ivy Mentors: thanks a lot. I think, Jenny, I'm just like 542 01:29:51.770 --> 01:30:05.850 Ivy Mentors: Number one. as a dad. Of course, you know, between my both roles I always will be a dad first. and it's it's giving me a lot of comfort, I think, as I shared with you. We just had this 543 01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:09.159 Ivy Mentors: very anxious and stressful session yesterday. 544 01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:26.910 Ivy Mentors: despite all the great skills that Hoda has, I've been really struggling, and and I told you I've shared you with my like even my former story. I struggle to this the first time, and I genuinely believe the value that met us like yourself can offer. I'm very, very genuinely, I believe I believe in it. 545 01:30:27.010 --> 01:30:29.840 Ivy Mentors: but I was still struggling to find where the issue is. 546 01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:36.489 Ivy Mentors: And I think you really you I think we are very holistically taken a stab at this. 547 01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:42.250 Ivy Mentors: I know that even though we came to you mainly, for like extracurriculars. 548 01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:47.780 Ivy Mentors: I think you really opened up a lot of horizon and 549 01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:58.380 Ivy Mentors: and I think you've also like kin",
    "d of gone one level, deeper right? And this is this is exactly one of the challenges which we did not discuss in any other, any other session, or with any other mentor 550 01:30:58.690 --> 01:30:59.710 Ivy Mentors: where 551 01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:18.430 Ivy Mentors: we are all like so focused on the kind of I would say means, like, you know, just like do x to y, but I mean, there is like the core core challenges mindset barrier style. I think that is so fundamental. Those foundational things, and every student is so different, and every like child is so different. 552 01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:26.179 Ivy Mentors: And then also, like the way these are all our perceptions and certain misconceptions. And a lot of these things where we feel like. 553 01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:30.320 Ivy Mentors: Oh, you need to do X to to to get into this, or you need to do why 554 01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:40.839 Ivy Mentors: So I think you've really opened up that thing for us, and I think I'm I'm glad to hear that very German reaction. To be very honest, like I was a not even sure whether 555 01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.169 Ivy Mentors: I should really 556 01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:55.820 Ivy Mentors: put that through this kind of whole. you know, mentorship program, you know more because I think there's some initial value that we were able to get out of the strategy. And you know, with the other mentor. So I think thanks a lot for that first. 557 01:31:55.850 --> 01:32:00.740 Ivy Mentors: And it's you know I who that was absolutely independent 558 01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:11.780 Ivy Mentors: and she was able to like in, you know, it's a very instant reaction from her to say, Oh, yeah, I would love to actually even work like on a my like twice a week. so 559 01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:24.690 Ivy Mentors: thanks a lot that about that. And I'm definitely gonna also have like, what about separate conversation with Huda to kind of really? see? How does she feel now? What are the areas where she really need",
    "s help? But 560 01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:31.259 Ivy Mentors: I would like to ask you, you know, just in terms of the program that we can really design for. who? The 561 01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:42.139 Ivy Mentors: Because the 3 3 things are kind of resonated. Or you know, if I were to really like bucket it into 3 things. Really, it's one is the whole strategy. And the game plan around like, how are 562 01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:49.299 Ivy Mentors: we going to really help? Or how are you really going to help with the make it into her, like, you know, dream schools, or whatever top schools? 563 01:32:49.420 --> 01:33:09.649 Ivy Mentors: it's very competitive, but at least like to do the best game plan as possible. Then, again, is you know the planning right? And and this is where, like time, management, and planning. And how do you juggle with all these things? And I know as a dad, that's one. Also one of the weak areas that Huda has right where she's she's not able to really progress on every front. 564 01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:23.199 Ivy Mentors: A one is not knowing what to do, but second is also, if she knows what to do, then it's just not possible. Right? So I think your your whole thing about maximizing time that's a foundational skill where I I really believe that your help can really help us. as as a mentor. 565 01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:30.649 Ivy Mentors: And the third one is really like executing it. So having an action item and plan. So it's your typical strategy planning and execution. 566 01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:54.509 Ivy Mentors: I would love to get a very candid view from from you like you know about how do you view like, you know, a a student like the how do you think? What kind of a cadence and what kind of a program? And you don't have to answer it right now, and that will be a part of our other, my other hat, where I would love you to design this, and and literally like, sell it to me, and I'm gonna buy it because I'm all sold for it now, because my daughter h",
    "as agreed right like that. She wants this help? 567 01:33:54.540 --> 01:34:15.560 Ivy Mentors: but at a very high level I want you to hear this from you. and and to like, what do you think are her key. Weak areas. And how do? What kind of a cadence do you think can help her? Because you you brought up this important point that we also are a bit late into this process. Right game, because, you know, I wish we had met you like last year. 568 01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:19.350 Ivy Mentors: so we only have like a year now and then. She has this one month in summer. 569 01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:35.879 Ivy Mentors: And there are like too many things. So that's a bit like I'm I'm a bit scared. Now, right? So tell me, what do you think would be a good kind of cadence? And what are the areas that you you think you would actually more help Huda on that Joda needs help on. I would love to hear your thoughts. 570 01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.620 Jenny Duan: Who? That? 571 01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:44.969 Jenny Duan: I know that you are exceptional, and I know that you are great. I want you to believe it for yourself. 572 01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:56.430 Jenny Duan: So I think that's what we can work on. The most is just having that leadership initiative and drive. I think I see it in you, but I want you to believe it for yourself. 573 01:34:56.450 --> 01:35:20.960 Jenny Duan: I think that you spend too much time on school, in my opinion, and I think that you should spend more time cultivating those extra curriculums because there are a million 4.0 students. But there is no one else who's built a game like you have. There's no one else who's leading a Vfx club who's doing all these things, and we want that to shine because your academic background is speaks for yourself. It speaks for itself. 574 01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:31.140 Jenny Duan: You're smart. You don't need to spend too many time too much time doing that. So I think one thing is optimizing how much time we spend on school and other thi",
    "ngs and helping you do that. 575 01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:38.310 Jenny Duan: I think that's one thing. Second thing, I think that you might struggle with is lack of awareness of opportunities, and 576 01:35:38.310 --> 01:36:03.829 Jenny Duan: that's something that I can also help you with crafting specific tailored activities that fit your profile, fit your goals, because obviously every student has different needs and different things that might help them. For example, a student studying business might go to lawn checks because they want to learn how to build a business. But you're not setting business. So why should you do that you should do something that's more specific towards you, something that can align with the experience that you already have. And maybe that's 577 01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:22.269 Jenny Duan: one reason why you're struggling to apply for these summer programs is because you're applying for programs that don't fit you. For example, you're not going to apply for astrophysics research because you don't do astrophysics research, right? You're going to apply for something that has to do with film communication, journalism, computer science and things like that. So let's work towards that. 578 01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:28.099 Jenny Duan: And I think another thing is working on your leadership. I think this is 579 01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:48.669 Jenny Duan: something that a lot of top schools really look for is your ability to lead other people? Because you know Stanford Harvard, they're looking for the future leaders of America. And what does that mean? That means people who can take initiative. That means people who can organize manage as well as get their own work done. So I think I'd like to see you take a more, a larger leadership role 580 01:36:48.710 --> 01:37:00.450 Jenny Duan: in your school, in, you know your classes in your community and all around. So I think that that's one thing that we can work on together is how we develop that leadership wi",
    "thin you. 581 01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:07.639 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. I think that's music to your my, yours. And and in terms of just the execution aspect. 582 01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:11.770 Ivy Mentors: I I love this kind of core fundamental things, and I so clearly see the value 583 01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:28.390 Ivy Mentors: like. just to kind of recap first is really about the planning right? Like, in terms of like, how to manage time and optimize way to focus. I think you're gonna put that framework and stuff like that. that falls under kind of planning. And then the second thing 584 01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:56.519 Ivy Mentors: I think, lack of awareness and being more specific. It's kind of a bit of strategy and access to information. So you're gonna really help with bringing in that like offline resources where she that's one of the challenges. Why, she's not able to do some of this, and I would imagine that would actually kind of fix some of the execution issue right? It's not that she doesn't want to do it. Otherwise, if she was not a a a doer she would have probably not developed the game. So I think she clearly has that. I think there are you you you you've really identified some root causes here. 585 01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:05.380 Ivy Mentors: And then finally, I think there's also a very mindset, oriented thing, with her nature and style of being very quiet and introvert. She's not able to really go out and take that initiative 586 01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:16.040 Ivy Mentors: right? So that that would be it. So what what do you think will be a good kind of a cadence, you know, for you know, for someone like you to help like the, for example. 587 01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:23.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it depends on how involved. Who do you want me to be with your passion projects. I think the 588 01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:45.340 Jenny Duan: general strategy guidance. Obviously this doesn't take too much time. It's more like giving you the opportunities, and you can a",
    "pply for them, and do things on your own time. I think that's about once a week will be enough. But if you want depending on how much support you need with your passion projects. I think that would be additional time if we want to like work on building that together. 589 01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:57.299 Jenny Duan: But that just depends on how you're feeling. And then, obviously, if you want specific help with an application or something like that, we can do it additional time to support you on that. But I think starting out 590 01:38:57.430 --> 01:39:10.940 Jenny Duan: probably once a week, with those additional like support sessions as needed. might be a good fit for now. But I'm curious to see like, do you feel like you would want extra support? Or do you feel like you would want less support? What do you think? How can I best help you? 591 01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:16.069 huda: Yeah. So I think we could start out by doing a weekly call 592 01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:22.059 huda: and see if like, if I need your support, like with the passion projects 593 01:39:22.150 --> 01:39:31.970 huda: for more time. Then maybe we could do like another session. that we can see how that works. But as for now, I think we should start up with a weekly call. 594 01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:41.459 Ivy Mentors: Great. I I think that is that that is, absolutely, I think, even like having a weekly once. we're 595 01:39:41.500 --> 01:40:04.939 Ivy Mentors: I think, number one also. Thanks for redefining. what fashion project has for us. Right? Because, And of course, like, you know, different people have different part of view. I'm also a big admirer of really focusing on one thing and getting it done. Well, but I think here the point was what is really a passion project, I mean just tying it to the community fact. But now you see, like how the passion project. 596 01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:15.679 Ivy Mentors: In fact, what we are doing. What you have done is really helped. Huda and me see the passion ",
    "project through the see extra curricular through the lens of Passion Project number one 597 01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:24.519 Ivy Mentors: and and in fact, it's pretty much now synonymous right? It's like extracurricular to that, for you is Fashion Project. But 598 01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:36.479 Ivy Mentors: the gaming is just one component of it, right? I think you have really like structured the project, for, you know, like it's not just enough for you to just execute and deliver because you're not just an engineer. Here. 599 01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:49.950 Ivy Mentors: What you are is actually it is you, and and you have to demonstrate. So I think that's the game plan. And I've I think that planning that accountability is another thing that I you know there's one thing which is execution support where you can. Actually 600 01:40:49.950 --> 01:41:07.520 Ivy Mentors: I I would love to understand from Huda what execution support, because now it's no more just about game development to that it. I think we have to reassess this because game development, I agree, even like Janice, for example, like, you know, because you are a good developer. You don't really need an upskilling or a a code feature like for you to to help you how to code. 601 01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:18.660 Ivy Mentors: I think. But now, when it comes to Youtube channel social media. I think that wealth of information and a very technical and specific information that Jenny has given us. 602 01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:27.260 Ivy Mentors: It makes me wonder that there would be a very different need from an execution perspective as well. Right? So I'm just saying my point of view, and more than happy to discuss offline. 603 01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:49.869 Ivy Mentors: but I think at least with the one week, you know more than happy to, you know. Kick, start, get started. So what I would request you. Jenny is like, you know. Thanks a lot for this. And Iv mentors what I would request is like, you know, if you could just l",
    "ike structure it for us, like, you know the plan of this package. Just give it a name so that you know, I'm able to really like, you know. See what it is. And then 604 01:41:49.870 --> 01:42:05.649 Ivy Mentors: we can get started with like 10 weeks to start with, and beyond that we could just keep extending it, because I would love for Hoda, because it's it's the game plan that is now coming out of your collaboration. So I would really want you to really be her kind of partner through the journey. 605 01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:13.949 Ivy Mentors: right? and and and that is what I firmly believe can can really help with that. So let's touch based on that as a next step. 606 01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:15.459 Jenny Duan: cool, sounds good. 607 01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:18.400 Ivy Mentors: amazing. Hold on, is that? Okay. 608 01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:23.560 huda: yeah, thank you so much, Jenny, this is such an insightful call. 609 01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:25.560 Jenny Duan: Yeah, thank you. 610 01:42:25.710 --> 01:42:47.309 Ivy Mentors: Amazing. So thanks a lot, Jenny. So I think, as a in our next connector, whatever you want to do. you know, I think first, like, if you have time today, just, you know, send me like an email to you know, my, I we mentor's Id and say, Hey, I I think this is a good way to package this program for Roda, and you know this is what you can do, and you can put some agenda and like just label it. I think all this information is already here. 611 01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.200 Ivy Mentors: then I can check with that as well. And let's see, let's start to get started with 10 weeks thing. 612 01:42:52.220 --> 01:43:02.670 Ivy Mentors: yeah, I I think this is a co-creation. Right? I mean, we have really created something, understanding our needs. And I love it. And even this particular session that you did 613 01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:11.130 Ivy Mentors: this is itself has so much value, like the things that have come out of it. And I would love to really like, you ",
