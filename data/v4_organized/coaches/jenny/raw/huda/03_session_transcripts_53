How's it going. 2 00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.320 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.520 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well, too. It's good to see you, I think, today. Oh, yeah. How was code with quasi? Actually, 1st day. 4 00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.400 huda: Yeah. So yesterday we went in person, and I was around 2 h away. 5 00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.919 huda: And. 6 00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.529 Jenny Duan: That's really far. 7 00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:37.659 huda: Yeah, it was really far. It was really fun, though. But then today, like, while we were heading out I was just like, I, just emailed like, like the code with classy team. And I asked if I could switch to online cause 8 00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:58.140 huda: it like 2 h there and back was like really hectic, and then I I couldn't do any of my like other work, like, for example, my summer homework, or like my extracurriculars. So so I was just like, Oh, can I switch to online? So from now on, I'm going to be doing online code of classy. But yeah. 9 00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.980 Jenny Duan: How? But what? Where was the office again 10 00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.990 Jenny Duan: like? Where was. 11 00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.050 huda: It was like in Sunnyvale. Like Santa Clara area. 12 00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.810 Jenny Duan: Oh, was it at a corporate office? I think you told me. 13 00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.210 huda: Yeah, it was at 23, and me's office. 14 00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.419 Jenny Duan: Wait. That's that is pretty cool, though, like. How was it seeing the office just for one day. 15 00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:30.650 huda: It was really cool, like so like you know how their Logos, like a pink and green like DNA strand like they have, like that decoration, like everywhere, like in Leds and stuff. It's pretty cool. 16 00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.160 Jenny Duan: Wow. 17 00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.670 Jenny Duan: that's pretty cool. And 18 00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.689 Jenny Duan: I guess now that you're doing online, like, how is it online. 19 00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.799 huda: Oh, it's definitely like a lot. It's like. 20 00:05:43.534 --> 00:05:44.250 huda: So 21 00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:56.792 huda: I guess yesterday we started working on like data visualization. And then I think there. Like the online is like a day behind, or something cause like we did the same exact thing. So I was a bit bored. But 22 00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.900 huda: I think. And it's it's gonna it's like, it's been pretty interesting so far, a lot about data science. 23 00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.560 Jenny Duan: Cool. 24 00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:21.919 Jenny Duan: okay. I think today, we wanted to focus on talking about your your game plan for your essays and for the like how you're going to approach that do you have anything that you wanted to cover before we go into that. 25 00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.670 huda: No, I think that's like the main topic. 26 00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.450 Jenny Duan: Okay. Sounds good. Then. 27 00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.150 Jenny Duan: let's see. Maybe. Do you want to work on the notion around the document? 28 00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.230 huda: I think the notion might be good. 29 00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.369 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me go on that. 30 00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.710 Jenny Duan: who's 31 00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.729 Jenny Duan: we have to make a new? 32 00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.759 Jenny Duan: It's fine. I'm just gonna go to the bottom. Do you see where it says action items. We can just work like under there. 33 00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.820 Jenny Duan: Like if you go into the main 34 00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.590 Jenny Duan: who does college and major list, and then if you go all the way down. 35 00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.220 Jenny Duan: Actually, I'm just gonna make a new notion page. 36 00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.530 huda: Wait. I think there's 1 called Personal Statement. 37 00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.349 Jenny Duan: Personal statement, examples or just personal statement. 38 00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.381 huda: It's just called personal statement. 39 00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.670 Jenny Duan: I see this? 40 00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.669 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, yeah, we can work down here. Then. 41 00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.180 Jenny Duan: So 42 00:07:42.130 --> 00:08:03.210 Jenny Duan: the structure, I think we can. What would might be helpful instead of talking about the structure. Because I feel like that's pretty standardized, like brainstorming writing essays, we can make a calendar of when we want to get things done with some like key dates and deadlines. And that way we can structure everything around when your applications are due. Now that we have your college list, and when you need to have 43 00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.820 Jenny Duan: you know everything complete. So 44 00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:11.640 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna segment it by month. Starting with June, July and August. 45 00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:16.210 Jenny Duan: Can you. Do you see my updates as they're live? Sure. Okay. 46 00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.680 Jenny Duan: so this month is June. 47 00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:21.020 Jenny Duan: july, August. 48 00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.920 Jenny Duan: September. 49 00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.840 Jenny Duan: October, December, January. 50 00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.699 Jenny Duan: So you basically have 6 months. 51 00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.430 Jenny Duan: to finish everything like a little bit over 6 months. 52 00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:41.980 Jenny Duan: so these next few months are, gonna be a big grind before you start before you get into your school. 53 00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.310 Jenny Duan: So 54 00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:54.020 Jenny Duan: let's start by blocking it sort of working backwards. So Usc is where you're applying early, and the Usc early application deadline is one. 55 00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.580 huda: It's november first.st 56 00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.037 Jenny Duan: November first.st Okay? So on November first, st I'm just gonna put this in 57 00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.470 Jenny Duan: in here as a bullet point. 58 00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.549 Jenny Duan: November first.st 59 00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.779 Jenny Duan: Usc Ea deadline. 60 00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.880 Jenny Duan: So if 61 00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:23.199 Jenny Duan: November 1st is the deadline, I think October, we can say we want to finish all of your all Usc essays by October. So that means. In September we're going to start drafting 62 00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:39.159 Jenny Duan: draft Usc essays. And in August the priority. So we're working backwards kind of from where the goal is to where we are right now. So in August, I think it would be good to draft your common app statement. So the reason why we're drafting it in August rather than now versus July is because 63 00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:53.195 Jenny Duan: we want you to have the summer to like, learn new things, to make more progress in your extracurriculars, and to like, have more impact. So that's why we're not starting writing your common app right now, like, I mean, we are. You are starting to draft it. I know that. But like 64 00:09:53.490 --> 00:10:01.080 Jenny Duan: I think we could, we don't need to finalize it until August. Just so you have more time to build on your extracurriculars and make more impact in that 65 00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.793 Jenny Duan: regard. And 66 00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.500 Jenny Duan: so 67 00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:27.249 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that that means that in June and July I I don't. I really don't think that you need to start essays like writing essays for things in June and July. I think that in these 2 months the best focus, the best priority for you should be to focus on your extracurriculars, and like putting all your energy into scaling them to the best of your ability. That's because 68 00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:40.000 Jenny Duan: you know you it. I think that once you start writing like everything goes kind of quickly. So I don't think it will. Actually, I don't think we need to start writing so far in advance, because then you don't have like the proof yet of your extracurriculars. 69 00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.640 Jenny Duan: And so in August you're going to draft your common F statement. 70 00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:52.130 Jenny Duan: And so temporary to draft the Usc essays, and then let me open your college list to see like what other schools are. 71 00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.040 Jenny Duan: Are 72 00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.329 Jenny Duan: coming in. 73 00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.540 Jenny Duan: So you have a total of 74 00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.940 Jenny Duan: let's see. 75 00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:09.573 Jenny Duan: 11 schools like counting the Uc application as one school. So the Uc regular decision is 76 00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.699 Jenny Duan: Can you look up when the Uc. Regular admissions deadline is. 77 00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.829 huda: Yeah, 78 00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.520 huda: It's in 79 00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.440 huda: November 30.th 80 00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.110 Jenny Duan: Okay. 81 00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.480 Jenny Duan: so I'm gonna put that down as another important date. So November 30th is Uc application deadline. 82 00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.710 Jenny Duan: which means that in 83 00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.799 Jenny Duan: I think November, we can finish 84 00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.390 Jenny Duan: all you see, 85 00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:50.830 Jenny Duan: essays. 86 00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.590 Jenny Duan: October should be draft, you see, essays. 87 00:11:56.403 --> 00:12:02.049 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that's another priority school. Let's see where else you're gonna be applying to along this timeline? 88 00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.850 Jenny Duan: so Usc is early admissions. 89 00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:14.779 Jenny Duan: Does Cal Poly Slow have let me just look at these early deadlines. Does Cal. Poly slow, have early admissions. 90 00:12:15.783 --> 00:12:20.249 huda: I don't think so, cause it's a state school, but I can check. 91 00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.720 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm looking at. Edit 2. 92 00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.759 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's due on November 30th to through Cal State. 93 00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:36.299 huda: Okay? I think also, I think I we're doing like early for Stanford as well. 94 00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.129 Jenny Duan: Oh, you can do early for Usc. And Stanford. 95 00:12:40.420 --> 00:13:01.369 huda: Oh, actually. So I talked to one of the Usc. Like like one of my friends from Usc. And she said she was able to apply early to both of them, because, because, like Usc has this like early action. And then also it's like non binding. And it's for scholarships. So 96 00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.369 huda: yeah, I think I think 97 00:13:05.982 --> 00:13:08.339 huda: I could probably do more research on that. But. 98 00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.957 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, yeah. I think it's okay. If you if you apply 99 00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.590 Jenny Duan: for the scholarship. 100 00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.149 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Which is a scholarship deadline. So Stanford then would be no, is that? That's also November first.st 101 00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:29.530 huda: you? 102 00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.170 huda: Yeah, I think. 103 00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.740 Jenny Duan: I think it should be. 104 00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.109 Jenny Duan: which means in October you need to draft Stanford essays. 105 00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.380 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 106 00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.260 Jenny Duan: okay. 107 00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.410 Jenny Duan: and then 108 00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.620 Jenny Duan: I'll apologize. 109 00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.300 Jenny Duan: And then in October you can draft a colleague. 110 00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.130 huda: Ashley, I think Cal Poly doesn't require any essays. 111 00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.559 Jenny Duan: Oh, really, okay, perfect 112 00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:21.169 Jenny Duan: and then are all your schools just regular decision? Beyond those 2. 113 00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.120 huda: Yeah. 114 00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:23.550 huda: okay. 115 00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.520 Jenny Duan: Okay? 116 00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.829 Jenny Duan: So then all your other schools should have like variable deadlines around December, right? 117 00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.899 Jenny Duan: So that means that December and January. So that means that November and December are going to be like your biggest 118 00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.260 Jenny Duan: crunch months 119 00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:54.230 Jenny Duan: for your schools. But that means that I think in August the focus should be to finish your common app, September to finish Usc. And Stanford, and then 120 00:14:54.827 --> 00:15:01.042 Jenny Duan: October to like. Write your applications for the Uc schools and 121 00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.409 Jenny Duan: in your other schools, starting in October. 122 00:15:05.735 --> 00:15:10.239 Jenny Duan: Does this timeline look good to you? Do you have any questions about the timeline and like. 123 00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.310 Jenny Duan: do you understand why we're starting in August versus now. 124 00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.848 huda: Yeah, I was wondering. 125 00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:24.660 huda: like the sees I mean, do you think like a month is like enough to like write like a really good like kind of finalized essay. 126 00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.720 Jenny Duan: Are you coming up. 127 00:15:27.448 --> 00:15:29.399 huda: For the Uc application. 128 00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.320 Jenny Duan: I think so. Yeah. 129 00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.679 Jenny Duan: they use the application. It's more essays. 130 00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:42.140 huda: Oh, okay, yeah, I was thinking, cause cause like it opens up in August. So 131 00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.230 huda: like. 132 00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:50.878 huda: maybe like, if if I wasn't too, like overloaded with, like the Usc. 133 00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:57.370 huda: could I like, maybe start writing like the Ucs. Like, what do you recommend it. 134 00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that. You can. You can start writing them anytime you want. I think. 135 00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:11.869 Jenny Duan: like, as long as past August, like, I think that's when you can start writing. Your essays in general just depends on your bandwidth. But the only thing is, I thought you might be busy with like senior year, and every like the 136 00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:29.609 Jenny Duan: in the scholarship applications which are also around this timeline. So this is just the college applications. But remember, we made that, like master list of scholarship things that has its own set of deadlines, too. So I know this might look empty, especially in a in August and September. But that's because your time will also be dedicated to like 137 00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.240 Jenny Duan: all the scholarship. Things are are also around this time. 138 00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 139 00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.590 huda: Sense. 140 00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:44.689 Jenny Duan: So I think, like I think you'll have more than enough writing, like, I think, be between all these essays, your scholarships, your awards, everything else. I think you have like more than enough 141 00:16:45.403 --> 00:16:46.670 Jenny Duan: writing opportunities. 142 00:16:47.283 --> 00:17:03.059 Jenny Duan: I think. Actually, one thing we could do right now is now that we have your college. So the the final things that we need to like think about before you actually apply for college beyond your college list, your major list is your extracurriculars list and your awards list. 143 00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:20.459 Jenny Duan: So I think extra curriculas. This we've touched on like quite a few times, but I think let's make like a final extra curriculums list right now. So that you know what you can expect to write, and then also the awards list. So let me see if there are folders in. Are there folders in your notion for these things? 144 00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.009 Jenny Duan: Oh, activity. Yeah, there's activities. 145 00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:29.800 Jenny Duan: Oh, it 146 00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:35.370 Jenny Duan: activity one. 147 00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.500 Jenny Duan: Well, 148 00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.350 Jenny Duan: save. 149 00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.920 Jenny Duan: You can say. 150 00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.870 Jenny Duan: what would you put S activity on? Actually, I don't want to. 151 00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.150 huda: I thought simple.

That article from Muslim girls, but I think that'll be a good place to keep it. But 186 00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.310 Jenny Duan: I feel like that doesn't quite count as an activity, though, cause I feel like you're not 187 00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.310 Jenny Duan: super involved with them. 188 00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.315 huda: Yeah, 189 00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.229 huda: I'm not sure right now, for the last 2 actually. 190 00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.425 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think these are like should be major priorities for the summer, like thinking about how you wanna fill these. I think 191 00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:33.859 Jenny Duan: youth Action Committee could be one. I also think, if you want to put social media like content creation as one that could also be good. 192 00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:38.529 Jenny Duan: I feel like you'll hear Youtube. And things are like, that's pretty cool. 193 00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.619 huda: Yeah. Actually, I've been active on like Tiktok and stuff. So 194 00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.929 huda: think maybe that would that'd be good to put on there. 195 00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 196 00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:54.260 Jenny Duan: So what that means, though, if you put it on there, it's like you have an incentive to work really hard on growing your Tiktok. 197 00:20:54.390 --> 00:21:01.349 Jenny Duan: because they really are gonna care about how like how many followers you have like your total view, count what you've made. And so 198 00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.319 Jenny Duan: one goal of yours could be like trying to go viral to the best of your ability this summer. 199 00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:11.071 huda: Something like at least twice a day. 200 00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.589 Jenny Duan: Have been going. 201 00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:21.059 huda: It's been. Some videos are like, doing well. But then and then it's just like the other ones are just stuck at like 200 or 300. 202 00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.230 Jenny Duan: yeah, I know. You mean, what phone do you use to film. 203 00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.839 huda: I use the iphone. 12. 204 00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.700 Jenny Duan: Okay. 205 00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.959 Jenny Duan: how's your camera quality. 206 00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.435 huda: I'd say it's it's pretty good. It's it's normal. 207 00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.299 Jenny Duan: And then what lighting do you fill in. 208 00:21:43.598 --> 00:21:56.841 huda: If I do like videos of like me talking, then I I use like a desk lamp, and then and then usually my contents are like like slideshows, or like the like, the photos feature. But yeah. 209 00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:06.024 Jenny Duan: Yeah, cause I think one thing to be can like this is kind of dumb, but it actually makes a big difference in tick talk like your background, and lighting like the like, really influences 210 00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:12.058 Jenny Duan: the like your engagement. So make sure you fill in white lighting, not yellow lighting, and like try to get 211 00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.569 Jenny Duan: a good bright, or neutral background. I think. 212 00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.360 huda: Yes. 213 00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.690 Jenny Duan: And 214 00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.049 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think Tiktok is a counts as a as an activity. I think 215 00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.230 Jenny Duan: if we could even find like one more 216 00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:31.009 Jenny Duan: activity for you. That would be good. I think we should spend some time focusing on this. 217 00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.640 Jenny Duan: But I wanna talk about your awards first, st just to make sure we're good with that that aspect, too. 218 00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.709 Jenny Duan: So academics and honors.

Games for change. Writing impact board. 227 00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.440 Jenny Duan: What about your school like computer science award. 228 00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.840 huda: Oh, yeah, the cte, cte award for computer science. 229 00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.579 huda: does.

Time would be too much. 233 00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.300 huda: I was, maybe I might 234 00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:00.688 huda: be able to get so this one's not really guaranteed.

At my school, if I'm able to like, get over 100 236 00:24:07.342 --> 00:24:08.489 huda: and if I. 237 00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.440 Jenny Duan: Should be easy this summer, right. 238 00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:18.990 huda: Yeah, I think. And also, I think work for nonprofit counts as well. So maybe I can put in stuff for empowering. Yeah. Cause I know, like 239 00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:24.269 huda: I know, like a lot of people do that with their organizations. 240 00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah.

But 257 00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.149 huda: I like I got in the I got in like the 258 00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.790 huda: minimum, like 259 00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:42.629 huda: qualifying like number. But since my reading score. Wasn't that good? I was able to become a finalist or anything 260 00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.770 huda: but 261 00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.079 huda: it's not working for some reason. 262 00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.589 Jenny Duan: No worries. 263 00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.278 huda: Yeah, it it just says, 264 00:26:48.634 --> 00:26:53.370 huda: it says you meet entry requirement for the National Merit Scholarship program. 265 00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:59.570 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think they announced that maybe in the I think that process is in the fall. 266 00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.160 huda: Okay. 267 00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:11.409 huda: so like, even if like, I'm not like a finalist or semi finalist finalist. 268 00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.020 huda: we're just like qualifying. Count. 269 00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.812 Jenny Duan: I think, semi finalist. 270 00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.060 Jenny Duan: When do they release that? 271 00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.060 Jenny Duan: Me look it up? 272 00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.769 Jenny Duan: You're notified in early September, so it should be fine by the time like you. 273 00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.519 Jenny Duan: by the time you actually apply. 274 00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:38.879 Jenny Duan: I think that would. That'll be a good award if you're a national merit. Semi finalist. 275 00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:50.759 Jenny Duan: So okay, you have some good awards. I think all you need right now is to get that presidential volunteer service award and, like your awards, are set. I think you have really strong awards, and I don't think 276 00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.099 Jenny Duan: you have any issues on that front. 277 00:27:55.370 --> 00:28:00.252 Jenny Duan: so I think that's good. So I think that the main thing, then, for you is your 278 00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:14.979 Jenny Duan: your extracurriculars. I think this is the area where we probably need to spend the most time, like the summer. Like building and working on, because I think it is important for you to reach at least that 10 marker. 279 00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay. 280 00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.740 Jenny Duan: alright. So 281 00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:32.917 Jenny Duan: on that front. I think that like the biggest opportunity for you would be to like, try to do. 282 00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:44.239 Jenny Duan: some nationally accredited organization like getting involved in something cause. I think we talked about this before like giving you more credibility includes, like associating yourself with organizations that 283 00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:53.510 Jenny Duan: bring credibility to you. So I think, why don't we take this session? And we do some research on things that you might find interesting. So 284 00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.759 Jenny Duan: like, are there any other causes or any other areas that you think 285 00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.590 Jenny Duan: are interesting, that you would want to learn more about. 286 00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.520 huda: Maybe like 287 00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:22.717 huda: some sort of like education. Organization. Maybe, like, I know, like I'm kind of passionate about like teaching people things in like different ways. So if like, there's like an organization that might like 288 00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.409 huda: that's like 289 00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.669 huda: centered around like education and different like 290 00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.390 huda: formats of it. Maybe that would. That would be great organization. 291 00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.450 huda: and then 292 00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.840 huda: other than that, maybe like 293 00:29:40.222 --> 00:29:41.430 huda: I feel like. 294 00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:52.319 huda: I know we tried doing like the the national, like Muslim organization, which they didn't get back and back to me in terms of like, if I'm eligible or not. 295 00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.060 huda: But 296 00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.520 huda: yeah, like, maybe something more like muslim related that could help. 297 00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:00.520 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 298 00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:10.159 Jenny Duan: I think that that's cool. I think you should also sorry. I think you should also look into the Hat club some more, and like, think about competing at hackathons. 299 00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.710 Jenny Duan: Cause I think that that's really cool, too. 300 00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:20.629 Jenny Duan: And the if if you heard the sound that was playing on my on my computer like, that's what I was looking at. Let me show you. 301 00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:21.340 huda: Counting it. 302 00:30:21.714 --> 00:30:26.959 Jenny Duan: I'm a big proponent of Hat Club. I really think that it's a good. 303 00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.910 Jenny Duan: I think it's a really good organization, and I think that you should 304 00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.740 Jenny Duan: consider this. 305 00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.229 Jenny Duan: Let me know if you can hear the sound, because I 306 00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.560 Jenny Duan: just want you to watch this. 307 00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:49.960 Jenny Duan: Can you hear the sound as the dawn the full moon rises, our journey will begin 308 00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:03.710 Jenny Duan: like students coded this, and did all the heart and all the water. Great cascades! This is like an AI audio. How long will we travel? Clinging to the edges of these great mountains. 309 00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.679 Jenny Duan: like high school students, made this the sun peaks off the horizon. 310 00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.950 Jenny Duan: casting a golden glow over the valley. 311 00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.020 Jenny Duan: What vibrant colors will you see as the light leaks across the plains? 312 00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.300 Jenny Duan: The music's probably also AI generative through the end. 313 00:31:23.155 --> 00:31:23.560 huda: Andre. 314 00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.380 Jenny Duan: Arrival of a cross country. 315 00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:40.059 huda: I have a question so like if if we're if we put like Hackathon Club or half club and the extracurricular list, how do you like put that cause just like competing in a hackathon that's like 316 00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:44.029 huda: will that count as like an extra curricular or. 317 00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.479 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it does like. 318 00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:50.659 Jenny Duan: of course.

I think it's like like my sister has done. My sisters gone to like multiple of these. 322 00:32:08.498 --> 00:32:19.279 Jenny Duan: And it's like for her. It's been like the best thing, like Super, good for her personal development, too, like a college aside, just like good for you cause you like computer science, and that 323 00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:31.050 Jenny Duan: it's not that many opportunities to meet other people interested in it. So I think this is like a pretty cool opportunity. The boreal express is in July 21.st They have one in in California. 324 00:32:31.468 --> 00:32:32.660 Jenny Duan: I don't know if we want to do. 325 00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.730 huda: Thinking like in person. Hackathons are kind of like more. 326 00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.819 huda: I guess. Like 327 00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.850 huda: like 328 00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:46.399 huda: it. Would it be the same if I did like an online hackathon, or. 329 00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.970 Jenny Duan: I think it's it's fine if you do online hackathons, too, but they're, I think they're just like harder to find. 330 00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:52.860 Jenny Duan: And so. 331 00:32:53.237 --> 00:33:00.029 huda: Completed in like some hackathons in middle school online. And then most of them went pretty well. 332 00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.550 Jenny Duan: What about high school cause? I think you can't put anything that you put in middle school on your application. But high schools. 333 00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:07.210 huda: Hi! 334 00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:17.607 huda: I did do a hackathon last year. In person. It was that it was at uc Santa Cruz. It was called Cruise Hacks, but. 335 00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.580 Jenny Duan: King. 336 00:33:20.219 --> 00:33:20.830 huda: No. 337 00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:40.610 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think, like winning prizes. Another thing, but I think, like we obviously hackathons can be good. I think if you win prizes it's better so if you if you want to do hackathons like this summer, I think that would be like a good idea. So that's 1 option that I propose another option. Let me look for the education nonprofits. 338 00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.770 Jenny Duan: let's see. 339 00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:48.470 Jenny Duan: see you. 340 00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.679 Jenny Duan: I'm looking at like the Department of Education's Opportunities. 341 00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.760 huda: Oh, I think it just got the results for the Assembly Maker Assembly members. 342 00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.080 huda: And it says I did get in. 343 00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:20.699 Jenny Duan: What is assembling. Oh, the thing that we just applied to like right? Wow! That's so fast. 344 00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.210 huda: Yeah, it's okay. 345 00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.819 Jenny Duan: This seems cool. Wait! Look at this. 346 00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.070 huda: Oh! 347 00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.460 huda: Is it the. 348 00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.849 Jenny Duan: Student internship, program. 349 00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.430 huda: Oh, yeah. Yeah. 350 00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.510 Jenny Duan: But do you think. 351 00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.710 huda: It looks. It looks interesting. It is similar to the the one that I just got the results from. 352 00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think you just submit. Why don't you submit application right now? 353 00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:14.703 huda: Okay.

It is in person. 357 00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:46.280 huda: I believe it's in person, but I think the 358 00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.409 huda: I think I can just and apply and see. 359 00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.330 Jenny Duan: Let me check it. 360 00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.800 Jenny Duan: if it's if it's like. 361 00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.460 Jenny Duan: If there's no use in applying like, if you can't do it, then 362 00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.250 Jenny Duan: let's see. 363 00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.899 Jenny Duan: Say that you have to. 364 00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.610 Jenny Duan: I think it's okay.

Probably I could apply to this later. I think. 376 00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:03.560 Jenny Duan: Okay, why apply to it later? 377 00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:09.560 huda: Hmm! Because there's like a lot of writing that I have to do. And I don't think I'm gonna do that on the call right now. 378 00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.020 Jenny Duan: Okay. 379 00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.869 huda: That like you have to like list like hobbies, goals. 380 00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.260 huda: Oh. 381 00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:22.439 Jenny Duan: Is it worth applying for this? Do you think if you don't, maybe you should send them an email and see? See if you're eligible first.st 382 00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.479 huda: Okay, yeah, that's a good idea. 383 00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.559 Jenny Duan: While you're sending emails, can you send this organization email? 384 00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.739 Jenny Duan: This is their contact list 385 00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.160 Jenny Duan: contact email. 386 00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:37.610 huda: Right. Ian. 387 00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:56.600 Jenny Duan: okay. 388 00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:01.039 Jenny Duan: let's see where else you could do go extracurricular wise. 389 00:44:01.819 --> 00:44:06.490 Jenny Duan: So the 2, the 2 options are like, you wanna do something education. 390 00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.580 Jenny Duan: and we want to join like an existing organization with something impactful. 391 00:44:13.545 --> 00:44:14.150 Jenny Duan: The. 392 00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.921 huda: Oh, also, I can't email 393 00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.070 huda: the 394 00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:28.610 huda: this is an internship person, because it says address is not in district. Please find a representative here. 395 00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.770 Jenny Duan: A ho. 396 00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.698 Jenny Duan: Okay, then maybe this is, that's not 397 00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.030 Jenny Duan: Maybe that's not applicable. But 398 00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.429 Jenny Duan: would you be interested in getting like a job. 399 00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:51.973 huda: Yeah, I think I would. 400 00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.379 huda: Maybe like briefly, though, because the summer's gonna fact. 401 00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.510 Jenny Duan: Alright 402 00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.850 huda: But like a normal job at like 403 00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.353 huda: at like 404 00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.299 huda: I don't have like a local like Google shop like, would that? Does that mean anything. 405 00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:19.349 Jenny Duan: No like that's like, that's fine like that. That's what I'm saying. Like, do you want to get a job? Cause I think that could also be impactful like. 406 00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:25.254 Jenny Duan: like, actually Erin, I'm pretty sure your dad has talked about er you. Do you know who Erin? You know Erin, right from 407 00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:38.059 Jenny Duan: Erin is like. She worked at Cvs all throughout high school, and like that's what her common Fsa. Was about, like her working at Cvs, not doing anything just like stocking shelves and things like that. So if you want to get a normal job like 408 00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:42.990 Jenny Duan: that's also impactful, too, like that, that that's like a good option, too. 409 00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.700 huda: Okay, yeah. I think that's a good idea. 410 00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.980 huda: Ryan. 411 00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:48.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so. 412 00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:56.419 huda: Now, because I I think I need to go to school and get like a working permit and everything. So. 413 00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:01.550 Jenny Duan: Okay, why do you need to get a working permit for a job? Are you 6? You're 6. You're more than 16, right? 414 00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:02.910 huda: Yeah. 415 00:46:03.397 --> 00:46:06.419 huda: I'm well, yeah, I'm turning 17 soon. But 416 00:46:07.106 --> 00:46:13.009 huda: like I think I don't know one of my sister is doing, and she did it senior year and she needed a work permit. 417 00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:15.380 Jenny Duan: Really 418 00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:22.109 Jenny Duan: okay, you can get a work permit. But you could start this summer like, I think, whatever you want to do, you should start it like soon. 419 00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.000 huda: Okay. Good. 420 00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.840 Jenny Duan: Cause. If you started in senior year, I mean, like it still could be valuable. But it won't affect your college application 421 00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:40.480 Jenny Duan: so like if you wanted to get a normal job, I think like you could start it in the summer, and it's a good way to like earn some money to before college, because when you actually go to college, you'll be spending a lot of money. 422 00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:46.600 Jenny Duan: so I think, like, okay, that's another option just getting a normal job. 423 00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:50.300 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's a waste of time. Actually, I think it's 424 00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:53.380 Jenny Duan: I think it's good 425 00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.840 Jenny Duan: and 426 00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:07.530 Jenny Duan: let's see what if you got an internship. You could also get an internship. Do you know any like 427 00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.839 Jenny Duan: tech start offs that you would want to? Internet like 428 00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.719 Jenny Duan: that could also be really interesting 429 00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:15.700 Jenny Duan: as an option for you. 430 00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:22.100 huda: Yeah, I don't know any specifically. But like, I think maybe like reaching out on Linkedin might help. 431 00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:26.839 Jenny Duan: I think that would actually be really impactful because you're a really good developer. 432 00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:33.760 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, like, freelance web development that could be like like another activity for you, too. 433 00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.540 huda: Okay, yeah, I think. 434 00:47:37.072 --> 00:47:41.139 huda: Yeah, I think I could set up like a like a fiber. Maybe. 435 00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.924 Jenny Duan: You should I should actually connect you with my friend Vardan. 436 00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:50.140 Jenny Duan: He started doing it in high school, and he now he still does it? 437 00:47:50.526 --> 00:48:08.520 Jenny Duan: Actually, my friend Virgin at Stanford is pretty cool. He started working at Walmart like as a full time software like Mobile up developer when he was like a freshman or something in college, but they hired him, not knowing he was a college student, but he was working full time remotely, and his faucet. No, he was in college until like 3 months in. 438 00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.349 Jenny Duan: but by that time he'd already worked there so like 439 00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.869 Jenny Duan: they knew he could actually work, but 440 00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:22.085 Jenny Duan: he was working like full time while in school, but he started just by doing it freelance. And you're a really good developer. So I think it. 441 00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:34.970 Jenny Duan: I think it would be good to maybe like, build out a portfolio. I mean, you already have a portfolio. Your personal website, start learning some more back end, like, I think, cause you're a really good front end. Dev, are you experienced with back end at all? 442 00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.520 huda: Oh, no! No! 443 00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.345 Jenny Duan: I think it'll be good to learn some back end like, look up this 444 00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.479 Jenny Duan: and start learning like mongo dB mongo database, or maybe like 445 00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.019 Jenny Duan: a fire base 446 00:48:50.603 --> 00:48:54.710 Jenny Duan: then start learning how to build out back ends. And then you think, like. 447 00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.040 Jenny Duan: you could actually like. 448 00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:58.230 Jenny Duan: you know. 449 00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:04.580 Jenny Duan: sell this to people, or like build websites for real businesses or startups. I think that that could be 450 00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:16.369 Jenny Duan: a solution for you. And like my 1st internship after I I finished high school was at a startup, and how I got it was just dming people on Linkedin saying that I wanted to learn more about startups. So 451 00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.010 Jenny Duan: like, honestly, you could just do that, and, like 452 00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.150 Jenny Duan: set up calls with people on Linkedin and talk to them for 30 min, and then. 453 00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.600 Jenny Duan: like sometimes maybe they'll offer you an opportunity at their startup. 454 00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.730 huda: Okay, that's yeah. That's a good idea. I think I could do some like 455 00:49:31.304 --> 00:49:32.726 huda: messaging on Linkedin. 456 00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.929 Jenny Duan: And also you could ask your dad to see if he has any friends who might need like some help 457 00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:50.819 Jenny Duan: like, I'm serious. We're your mom like cause. She also, you know, works in engineering like, ask around and see like who might need help. Ask your sister see? Like clubs at her school people she knows like maybe they will need some help and like. 458 00:49:51.880 --> 00:50:03.457 Jenny Duan: unfortunately for you, but also, fortunately for you, like, everyone wants to take advantage of free labor, so especially because you're a good coder. So I think, like that should be a good opportunity for you to 459 00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:08.930 Jenny Duan: like, add another extracurricular, but also get some practice and like work on a real client project. 460 00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:30.530 Jenny Duan: So I think those are all good options. So the options that we've explored so far are working remote development. Either, you know, building out your freelance business more, or perhaps working at getting your spread, getting your dad or mom or sister to connect you with the startup, or finding a startup on Linkedin. That's like one option. The second option is 461 00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:39.719 Jenny Duan: hackathons, like competing more in hackathons virtual and in person 3rd option is getting a real job. By real job, like 462 00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:44.850 Jenny Duan: working at a Bogo shop like working at a grocery store like something like customer facing. 463 00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.445 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And then 464 00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:56.029 Jenny Duan: other option is email, this education equity lab, and like, see if you can work with them. That probably like, I think that might be tough. But like. 465 00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:58.820 Jenny Duan: that's another option. 466 00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:05.509 Jenny Duan: yeah, any questions so far about like those ideas. 467 00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.300 huda: No, that definitely makes sense. And 468 00:51:08.726 --> 00:51:13.360 huda: I think freelance would actually be really great option. And then I think 469 00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:26.780 huda: I feel like I'm not sure but it could also have a good metrics if I'm able to get like a lot of clients, then. Maybe I can like how much like money I earned, or like. How many projects I did. 470 00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:34.080 Jenny Duan: Exactly. Exactly. That's a really good idea. So what is your plan for finding clients? And how is this gonna work. 471 00:51:35.219 --> 00:51:39.529 huda: Yeah, I think I'm thinking, like, probably I'll set up a fiber 472 00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:55.709 huda: and then that way, like, a lot of people just kind of get like projects from there. But like, to begin with, like to put some like background information. I could probably put like, I developed the website for folklift. And then maybe, like a few of like 473 00:51:56.309 --> 00:52:04.080 huda: I can make a few projects. Just like to exemplify like what I can make and then 474 00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:11.520 huda: I think like from there I don't know if it's like easy.

Like the online is like a day behind, or something cause like we did the same exact thing. So I was a bit bored. But 22 00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.900 huda: I think. And it's it's gonna it's like, it's been pretty interesting so far, a lot about data science. 23 00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.560 Jenny Duan: Cool. 24 00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:21.919 Jenny Duan: okay. I think today, we wanted to focus on talking about your your game plan for your essays and for the like how you're going to approach that do you have anything that you wanted to cover before we go into that. 25 00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.670 huda: No, I think that's like the main topic. 26 00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.450 Jenny Duan: Okay. Sounds good. Then. 27 00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.150 Jenny Duan: let's see. Maybe. Do you want to work on the notion around the document? 28 00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.230 huda: I think the notion might be good. 29 00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.369 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me go on that. 30 00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.710 Jenny Duan: who's 31 00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.729 Jenny Duan: we have to make a new? 32 00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.759 Jenny Duan: It's fine. I'm just gonna go to the bottom. Do you see where it says action items. We can just work like under there. 33 00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.820 Jenny Duan: Like if you go into the main 34 00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.590 Jenny Duan: who does college and major list, and then if you go all the way down. 35 00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.220 Jenny Duan: Actually, I'm just gonna make a new notion page. 36 00:",
    "07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.530 huda: Wait. I think there's 1 called Personal Statement. 37 00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.349 Jenny Duan: Personal statement, examples or just personal statement. 38 00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.381 huda: It's just called personal statement. 39 00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.670 Jenny Duan: I see this? 40 00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.669 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, yeah, we can work down here. Then. 41 00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.180 Jenny Duan: So 42 00:07:42.130 --> 00:08:03.210 Jenny Duan: the structure, I think we can. What would might be helpful instead of talking about the structure. Because I feel like that's pretty standardized, like brainstorming writing essays, we can make a calendar of when we want to get things done with some like key dates and deadlines. And that way we can structure everything around when your applications are due. Now that we have your college list, and when you need to have 43 00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.820 Jenny Duan: you know everything complete. So 44 00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:11.640 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna segment it by month. Starting with June, July and August. 45 00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:16.210 Jenny Duan: Can you. Do you see my updates as they're live? Sure. Okay. 46 00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.680 Jenny Duan: so this month is June. 47 00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:21.020 Jenny Duan: july, August. 48 00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.920 Jenny Duan: September. 49 00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.840 Jenny Duan: October, December, January. 50 00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.699 Jenny Duan: So you basically have 6 months. 51 00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.430 Jenny Duan: to finish everything like a little bit over 6 months. 52 00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:41.980 Jenny Duan: so these next few months are, gonna be a big grind before you start before you get into your school. 53 00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.310 Jenny Duan: So 54 00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:54.020 Jenny Duan: let's start by blocking it sort of working backwards. So Usc is where you're applying early, and the Usc ea",
    "rly application deadline is one. 55 00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.580 huda: It's november first.st 56 00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.037 Jenny Duan: November first.st Okay? So on November first, st I'm just gonna put this in 57 00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.470 Jenny Duan: in here as a bullet point. 58 00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.549 Jenny Duan: November first.st 59 00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.779 Jenny Duan: Usc Ea deadline. 60 00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.880 Jenny Duan: So if 61 00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:23.199 Jenny Duan: November 1st is the deadline, I think October, we can say we want to finish all of your all Usc essays by October. So that means. In September we're going to start drafting 62 00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:39.159 Jenny Duan: draft Usc essays. And in August the priority. So we're working backwards kind of from where the goal is to where we are right now. So in August, I think it would be good to draft your common app statement. So the reason why we're drafting it in August rather than now versus July is because 63 00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:53.195 Jenny Duan: we want you to have the summer to like, learn new things, to make more progress in your extracurriculars, and to like, have more impact. So that's why we're not starting writing your common app right now, like, I mean, we are. You are starting to draft it. I know that. But like 64 00:09:53.490 --> 00:10:01.080 Jenny Duan: I think we could, we don't need to finalize it until August. Just so you have more time to build on your extracurriculars and make more impact in that 65 00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.793 Jenny Duan: regard. And 66 00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.500 Jenny Duan: so 67 00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:27.249 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that that means that in June and July I I don't. I really don't think that you need to start essays like writing essays for things in June and July. I think that in these 2 months the best focus, the best priority for you should be to focus on your extracurriculars, and like putting all your energ",
    "y into scaling them to the best of your ability. That's because 68 00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:40.000 Jenny Duan: you know you it. I think that once you start writing like everything goes kind of quickly. So I don't think it will. Actually, I don't think we need to start writing so far in advance, because then you don't have like the proof yet of your extracurriculars. 69 00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.640 Jenny Duan: And so in August you're going to draft your common F statement. 70 00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:52.130 Jenny Duan: And so temporary to draft the Usc essays, and then let me open your college list to see like what other schools are. 71 00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.040 Jenny Duan: Are 72 00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.329 Jenny Duan: coming in. 73 00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.540 Jenny Duan: So you have a total of 74 00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.940 Jenny Duan: let's see. 75 00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:09.573 Jenny Duan: 11 schools like counting the Uc application as one school. So the Uc regular decision is 76 00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.699 Jenny Duan: Can you look up when the Uc. Regular admissions deadline is. 77 00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.829 huda: Yeah, 78 00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.520 huda: It's in 79 00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.440 huda: November 30.th 80 00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.110 Jenny Duan: Okay. 81 00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.480 Jenny Duan: so I'm gonna put that down as another important date. So November 30th is Uc application deadline. 82 00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.710 Jenny Duan: which means that in 83 00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.799 Jenny Duan: I think November, we can finish 84 00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.390 Jenny Duan: all you see, 85 00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:50.830 Jenny Duan: essays. 86 00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.590 Jenny Duan: October should be draft, you see, essays. 87 00:11:56.403 --> 00:12:02.049 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that's another priority school. Let's see where else you're gonna be applying to along this timeline? 88 00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.850 Jenny Duan: so Usc is e",
    "arly admissions. 89 00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:14.779 Jenny Duan: Does Cal Poly Slow have let me just look at these early deadlines. Does Cal. Poly slow, have early admissions. 90 00:12:15.783 --> 00:12:20.249 huda: I don't think so, cause it's a state school, but I can check. 91 00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.720 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm looking at. Edit 2. 92 00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.759 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's due on November 30th to through Cal State. 93 00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:36.299 huda: Okay? I think also, I think I we're doing like early for Stanford as well. 94 00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.129 Jenny Duan: Oh, you can do early for Usc. And Stanford. 95 00:12:40.420 --> 00:13:01.369 huda: Oh, actually. So I talked to one of the Usc. Like like one of my friends from Usc. And she said she was able to apply early to both of them, because, because, like Usc has this like early action. And then also it's like non binding. And it's for scholarships. So 96 00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.369 huda: yeah, I think I think 97 00:13:05.982 --> 00:13:08.339 huda: I could probably do more research on that. But. 98 00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.957 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, yeah. I think it's okay. If you if you apply 99 00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.590 Jenny Duan: for the scholarship. 100 00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.149 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Which is a scholarship deadline. So Stanford then would be no, is that? That's also November first.st 101 00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:29.530 huda: you? 102 00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.170 huda: Yeah, I think. 103 00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.740 Jenny Duan: I think it should be. 104 00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.109 Jenny Duan: which means in October you need to draft Stanford essays. 105 00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.380 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 106 00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.260 Jenny Duan: okay. 107 00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.410 Jenny Duan: and then 108 00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.620 Jenny Duan: I'll apologize. 109 00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.300 Jenny Duan: And then in October you can draft",
    " a colleague. 110 00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.130 huda: Ashley, I think Cal Poly doesn't require any essays. 111 00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.559 Jenny Duan: Oh, really, okay, perfect 112 00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:21.169 Jenny Duan: and then are all your schools just regular decision? Beyond those 2. 113 00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.120 huda: Yeah. 114 00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:23.550 huda: okay. 115 00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.520 Jenny Duan: Okay? 116 00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.829 Jenny Duan: So then all your other schools should have like variable deadlines around December, right? 117 00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.899 Jenny Duan: So that means that December and January. So that means that November and December are going to be like your biggest 118 00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.260 Jenny Duan: crunch months 119 00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:54.230 Jenny Duan: for your schools. But that means that I think in August the focus should be to finish your common app, September to finish Usc. And Stanford, and then 120 00:14:54.827 --> 00:15:01.042 Jenny Duan: October to like. Write your applications for the Uc schools and 121 00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.409 Jenny Duan: in your other schools, starting in October. 122 00:15:05.735 --> 00:15:10.239 Jenny Duan: Does this timeline look good to you? Do you have any questions about the timeline and like. 123 00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.310 Jenny Duan: do you understand why we're starting in August versus now. 124 00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.848 huda: Yeah, I was wondering. 125 00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:24.660 huda: like the sees I mean, do you think like a month is like enough to like write like a really good like kind of finalized essay. 126 00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.720 Jenny Duan: Are you coming up. 127 00:15:27.448 --> 00:15:29.399 huda: For the Uc application. 128 00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.320 Jenny Duan: I think so. Yeah. 129 00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.679 Jenny Duan: they use the application. It's more essays. 130 00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:42.140 huda: Oh, okay, y",
    "eah, I was thinking, cause cause like it opens up in August. So 131 00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.230 huda: like. 132 00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:50.878 huda: maybe like, if if I wasn't too, like overloaded with, like the Usc. 133 00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:57.370 huda: could I like, maybe start writing like the Ucs. Like, what do you recommend it. 134 00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that. You can. You can start writing them anytime you want. I think. 135 00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:11.869 Jenny Duan: like, as long as past August, like, I think that's when you can start writing. Your essays in general just depends on your bandwidth. But the only thing is, I thought you might be busy with like senior year, and every like the 136 00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:29.609 Jenny Duan: in the scholarship applications which are also around this timeline. So this is just the college applications. But remember, we made that, like master list of scholarship things that has its own set of deadlines, too. So I know this might look empty, especially in a in August and September. But that's because your time will also be dedicated to like 137 00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.240 Jenny Duan: all the scholarship. Things are are also around this time. 138 00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 139 00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.590 huda: Sense. 140 00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:44.689 Jenny Duan: So I think, like I think you'll have more than enough writing, like, I think, be between all these essays, your scholarships, your awards, everything else. I think you have like more than enough 141 00:16:45.403 --> 00:16:46.670 Jenny Duan: writing opportunities. 142 00:16:47.283 --> 00:17:03.059 Jenny Duan: I think. Actually, one thing we could do right now is now that we have your college. So the the final things that we need to like think about before you actually apply for college beyond your college list, your major list is your extracurriculars list and your awards list. 143 00:17:03.080 --> 0",
    "0:17:20.459 Jenny Duan: So I think extra curriculas. This we've touched on like quite a few times, but I think let's make like a final extra curriculums list right now. So that you know what you can expect to write, and then also the awards list. So let me see if there are folders in. Are there folders in your notion for these things? 144 00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.009 Jenny Duan: Oh, activity.

But I won't really call myself really like 180 00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:28.440 huda: an active member.

That article from Muslim girls, but I think that'll be a good place to keep it. But 186 00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.310 Jenny Duan: I feel like that doesn't quite count as an activity, though, cause I feel like you're not 187 00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.310 Jenny Duan: super involved with them. 188 00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.315 huda: Yeah, 189 00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.229 huda: I'm not sure right now, for the last 2 actually. 190 00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.425 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think these are like should be major priorities for the summer, like thinking about how you wanna fill these. I think 191 00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:33.859 Jenny Duan: youth Action Committee could be one. I also think, if you want to put social media like content creation as one that could also be good. 192 00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:38.529 Jenny Duan: I feel like you'll hear Youtube. And things are like, that's pretty cool. 193 00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.619 huda: Yeah. Actually, I've been active on like Tiktok and stuff. So 194 00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.929 hu",
    "da: think maybe that would that'd be good to put on there. 195 00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 196 00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:54.260 Jenny Duan: So what that means, though, if you put it on there, it's like you have an incentive to work really hard on growing your Tiktok. 197 00:20:54.390 --> 00:21:01.349 Jenny Duan: because they really are gonna care about how like how many followers you have like your total view, count what you've made. And so 198 00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.319 Jenny Duan: one goal of yours could be like trying to go viral to the best of your ability this summer. 199 00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:11.071 huda: Something like at least twice a day. 200 00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.589 Jenny Duan: Have been going. 201 00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:21.059 huda: It's been. Some videos are like, doing well. But then and then it's just like the other ones are just stuck at like 200 or 300. 202 00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.230 Jenny Duan: yeah, I know. You mean, what phone do you use to film. 203 00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.839 huda: I use the iphone. 12. 204 00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.700 Jenny Duan: Okay. 205 00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.959 Jenny Duan: how's your camera quality. 206 00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.435 huda: I'd say it's it's pretty good. It's it's normal. 207 00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.299 Jenny Duan: And then what lighting do you fill in. 208 00:21:43.598 --> 00:21:56.841 huda: If I do like videos of like me talking, then I I use like a desk lamp, and then and then usually my contents are like like slideshows, or like the like, the photos feature. But yeah. 209 00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:06.024 Jenny Duan: Yeah, cause I think one thing to be can like this is kind of dumb, but it actually makes a big difference in tick talk like your background, and lighting like the like, really influences 210 00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:12.058 Jenny Duan: the like your engagement. So make sure you fill in white lighting, not yellow lighting, and like try to get 211 00:22:1",
    "2.510 --> 00:22:15.569 Jenny Duan: a good bright, or neutral background.

I think 215 00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.230 Jenny Duan: if we could even find like one more 216 00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:31.009 Jenny Duan: activity for you. That would be good. I think we should spend some time focusing on this. 217 00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.640 Jenny Duan: But I wanna talk about your awards first, st just to make sure we're good with that that aspect, too. 218 00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.709 Jenny Duan: So academics and honors.

I was able to become a finalist or anything 260 00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.770 huda: but 261 00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.079 huda: it's not working for some reason. 262 00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.589 Jenny Duan: No worries. 263 00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.278 huda: Yeah, it it just says, 264 00:26:48.634 --> 00:26:53.370 huda: it says you meet entry requirement for the National Merit Scholarship program. 265 00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:59.570 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think they announced that maybe in the I think that process is in the fall. 266 00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.160 huda: Okay. 267 00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:11.409 huda: so like, even if like, I'm not like a finalist or semi finalist finalist. 268 00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.020 huda: we're just like qualifying. Count. 269 00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.812 Jenny Duan: I think, semi finalist. 270 00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.060 Jenny Duan: When do they release that? 271 00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.060 Jenny Duan: Me look it up? 272 00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.769 Jenny Duan: You're notified in early September, so it should be fine by the time like you. 273 00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.519 Jenny Duan: by the time you actually apply. 274 00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:38.879 Jenny Duan: I think that would. That'll be a good award if you're a national merit. Semi finalist. 275 00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:50.759 Jenny Duan: So okay, you have some good awards. I think all you need right now is to get that presidential volunteer service award and, like your awards, are set. I think you have really strong awards, and I don't think 276 00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.099 Jenny Duan: you have any issues on that front. 277 00:27:55.370 --> 00:28:00.252 Jenny Duan: so I think that's good.",
    " So I think that the main thing, then, for you is your 278 00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:14.979 Jenny Duan: your extracurriculars. I think this is the area where we probably need to spend the most time, like the summer. Like building and working on, because I think it is important for you to reach at least that 10 marker. 279 00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay. 280 00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.740 Jenny Duan: alright. So 281 00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:32.917 Jenny Duan: on that front. I think that like the biggest opportunity for you would be to like, try to do. 282 00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:44.239 Jenny Duan: some nationally accredited organization like getting involved in something cause. I think we talked about this before like giving you more credibility includes, like associating yourself with organizations that 283 00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:53.510 Jenny Duan: bring credibility to you. So I think, why don't we take this session? And we do some research on things that you might find interesting. So 284 00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.759 Jenny Duan: like, are there any other causes or any other areas that you think 285 00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.590 Jenny Duan: are interesting, that you would want to learn more about. 286 00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.520 huda: Maybe like 287 00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:22.717 huda: some sort of like education. Organization. Maybe, like, I know, like I'm kind of passionate about like teaching people things in like different ways. So if like, there's like an organization that might like 288 00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.409 huda: that's like 289 00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.669 huda: centered around like education and different like 290 00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.390 huda: formats of it. Maybe that would. That would be great organization. 291 00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.450 huda: and then 292 00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.840 huda: other than that, maybe like 293 00:29:40.222 --> 00:29:41.430 huda: I feel like. 294 00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:52.319 huda: I know we ",
    "tried doing like the the national, like Muslim organization, which they didn't get back and back to me in terms of like, if I'm eligible or not. 295 00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.060 huda: But 296 00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.520 huda: yeah, like, maybe something more like muslim related that could help. 297 00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:00.520 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 298 00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:10.159 Jenny Duan: I think that that's cool.

I think you should also look into the Hat club some more, and like, think about competing at hackathons. 299 00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.710 Jenny Duan: Cause I think that that's really cool, too. 300 00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:20.629 Jenny Duan: And the if if you heard the sound that was playing on my on my computer like, that's what I was looking at. Let me show you. 301 00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:21.340 huda: Counting it. 302 00:30:21.714 --> 00:30:26.959 Jenny Duan: I'm a big proponent of Hat Club.

Great cascades! This is like an AI audio. How long will we travel? Clinging to the edges of these great mountains. 309 00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.679 Jenny Duan: like high school students, made this the sun peaks off the horizon. 310 00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.950 Jenny Duan: casting a golden glow over the valley. 311 00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.020 Jenny Duan: What vibrant colors will you see as the light leaks across the plains? 3",
    "12 00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.300 Jenny Duan: The music's probably also AI generative through the end. 313 00:31:23.155 --> 00:31:23.560 huda: Andre. 314 00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.380 Jenny Duan: Arrival of a cross country. 315 00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:40.059 huda: I have a question so like if if we're if we put like Hackathon Club or half club and the extracurricular list, how do you like put that cause just like competing in a hackathon that's like 316 00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:44.029 huda: will that count as like an extra curricular or. 317 00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.479 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it does like. 318 00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:50.659 Jenny Duan: of course. Yeah, it does. I mean, if J.

I think it's like like my sister has done. My sisters gone to like multiple of these. 322 00:32:08.498 --> 00:32:19.279 Jenny Duan: And it's like for her. It's been like the best thing, like Super, good for her personal development, too, like a college aside, just like good for you cause you like computer science, and that 323 00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:31.050 Jenny Duan: it's not that many opportunities to meet other people interested in it. So I think this is like a pretty cool opportunity. The boreal express is in July 21.st They have one in in California. 324 00:32:31.468 --> 00:32:32.660 Jenny Duan: I don't know if we want to do. 325 00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.730 huda: Thinking like in person. Hackathons are kind of like more. 326 00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.819 huda: I guess. Like 327 00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.850 huda: like 328 00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:46.399 huda: it. Would it be the same if I d",
    "id like an online hackathon, or. 329 00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.970 Jenny Duan: I think it's it's fine if you do online hackathons, too, but they're, I think they're just like harder to find. 330 00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:52.860 Jenny Duan: And so. 331 00:32:53.237 --> 00:33:00.029 huda: Completed in like some hackathons in middle school online. And then most of them went pretty well. 332 00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.550 Jenny Duan: What about high school cause? I think you can't put anything that you put in middle school on your application. But high schools. 333 00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:07.210 huda: Hi! 334 00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:17.607 huda: I did do a hackathon last year. In person. It was that it was at uc Santa Cruz. It was called Cruise Hacks, but. 335 00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.580 Jenny Duan: King. 336 00:33:20.219 --> 00:33:20.830 huda: No. 337 00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:40.610 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think, like winning prizes. Another thing, but I think, like we obviously hackathons can be good. I think if you win prizes it's better so if you if you want to do hackathons like this summer, I think that would be like a good idea. So that's 1 option that I propose another option. Let me look for the education nonprofits. 338 00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.770 Jenny Duan: let's see. 339 00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:48.470 Jenny Duan: see you. 340 00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.679 Jenny Duan: I'm looking at like the Department of Education's Opportunities. 341 00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.760 huda: Oh, I think it just got the results for the Assembly Maker Assembly members. 342 00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.080 huda: And it says I did get in. 343 00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:20.699 Jenny Duan: What is assembling.

But it won't affect your college application 421 00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:40.480 Jenny Duan: so like if you wanted to get a normal job, I think like you could start it in the summer, and it's a good way to like earn some money to before college, because when you actually go to college, you'll be spending a lot of money. 422 00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:46.600 Jenny Duan: so I think, like, okay, that's another option just getting a normal job. 423 00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:50.300 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's a waste of time. Actually, I think it's 424 00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:53.380 Jenny Duan: I think it's good 425 00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.840 Jenny Duan: and 426 00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:07.530 Jenny Duan: let's see what if you got an internship. You could also get an internship. Do you know any like 427 00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.839 Jenny Duan: tech start offs that you would want to? Internet like 428 00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.719 Jenny Duan: that could also be really interesting 429 00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:15.700 Jenny Duan: as an option for you. 430 00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:22.100 huda: Yeah, I don't know any specifically. But like, I think maybe like reaching out on Linkedin might help. 431 00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:26.839 Jenny Dua",
    "n: I think that would actually be really impactful because you're a really good developer. 432 00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:33.760 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, like, freelance web development that could be like like another activity for you, too. 433 00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.540 huda: Okay, yeah, I think. 434 00:47:37.072 --> 00:47:41.139 huda: Yeah, I think I could set up like a like a fiber. Maybe. 435 00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.924 Jenny Duan: You should I should actually connect you with my friend Vardan. 436 00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:50.140 Jenny Duan: He started doing it in high school, and he now he still does it? 437 00:47:50.526 --> 00:48:08.520 Jenny Duan: Actually, my friend Virgin at Stanford is pretty cool. He started working at Walmart like as a full time software like Mobile up developer when he was like a freshman or something in college, but they hired him, not knowing he was a college student, but he was working full time remotely, and his faucet. No, he was in college until like 3 months in. 438 00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.349 Jenny Duan: but by that time he'd already worked there so like 439 00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.869 Jenny Duan: they knew he could actually work, but 440 00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:22.085 Jenny Duan: he was working like full time while in school, but he started just by doing it freelance. And you're a really good developer. So I think it. 441 00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:34.970 Jenny Duan: I think it would be good to maybe like, build out a portfolio. I mean, you already have a portfolio. Your personal website, start learning some more back end, like, I think, cause you're a really good front end. Dev, are you experienced with back end at all? 442 00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.520 huda: Oh, no! No! 443 00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.345 Jenny Duan: I think it'll be good to learn some back end like, look up this 444 00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.479 Jenny Duan: and start learning like mongo dB mongo database, or maybe like 445 00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.019 Jenny Duan: ",
    "a fire base 446 00:48:50.603 --> 00:48:54.710 Jenny Duan: then start learning how to build out back ends. And then you think, like. 447 00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.040 Jenny Duan: you could actually like. 448 00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:58.230 Jenny Duan: you know. 449 00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:04.580 Jenny Duan: sell this to people, or like build websites for real businesses or startups. I think that that could be 450 00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:16.369 Jenny Duan: a solution for you. And like my 1st internship after I I finished high school was at a startup, and how I got it was just dming people on Linkedin saying that I wanted to learn more about startups. So 451 00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.010 Jenny Duan: like, honestly, you could just do that, and, like 452 00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.150 Jenny Duan: set up calls with people on Linkedin and talk to them for 30 min, and then. 453 00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.600 Jenny Duan: like sometimes maybe they'll offer you an opportunity at their startup. 454 00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.730 huda: Okay, that's yeah. That's a good idea. I think I could do some like 455 00:49:31.304 --> 00:49:32.726 huda: messaging on Linkedin. 456 00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.929 Jenny Duan: And also you could ask your dad to see if he has any friends who might need like some help 457 00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:50.819 Jenny Duan: like, I'm serious. We're your mom like cause. She also, you know, works in engineering like, ask around and see like who might need help. Ask your sister see? Like clubs at her school people she knows like maybe they will need some help and like. 458 00:49:51.880 --> 00:50:03.457 Jenny Duan: unfortunately for you, but also, fortunately for you, like, everyone wants to take advantage of free labor, so especially because you're a good coder. So I think, like that should be a good opportunity for you to 459 00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:08.930 Jenny Duan: like, add another extracurricular, but also get some practice and like work on a real client project. ",
    "460 00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:30.530 Jenny Duan: So I think those are all good options. So the options that we've explored so far are working remote development. Either, you know, building out your freelance business more, or perhaps working at getting your spread, getting your dad or mom or sister to connect you with the startup, or finding a startup on Linkedin. That's like one option. The second option is 461 00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:39.719 Jenny Duan: hackathons, like competing more in hackathons virtual and in person 3rd option is getting a real job. By real job, like 462 00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:44.850 Jenny Duan: working at a Bogo shop like working at a grocery store like something like customer facing. 463 00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.445 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And then 464 00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:56.029 Jenny Duan: other option is email, this education equity lab, and like, see if you can work with them. That probably like, I think that might be tough. But like. 465 00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:58.820 Jenny Duan: that's another option. 466 00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:05.509 Jenny Duan: yeah, any questions so far about like those ideas. 467 00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.300 huda: No, that definitely makes sense. And 468 00:51:08.726 --> 00:51:13.360 huda: I think freelance would actually be really great option. And then I think 469 00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:26.780 huda: I feel like I'm not sure but it could also have a good metrics if I'm able to get like a lot of clients, then. Maybe I can like how much like money I earned, or like. How many projects I did. 470 00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:34.080 Jenny Duan: Exactly. Exactly. That's a really good idea. So what is your plan for finding clients? And how is this gonna work. 471 00:51:35.219 --> 00:51:39.529 huda: Yeah, I think I'm thinking, like, probably I'll set up a fiber 472 00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:55.709 huda: and then that way, like, a lot of people just kind of get like projects from there. But like, to begin with, like to put some like backgr",
    "ound information. I could probably put like, I developed the website for folklift. And then maybe, like a few of like 473 00:51:56.309 --> 00:52:04.080 huda: I can make a few projects. Just like to exemplify like what I can make and then 474 00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:11.520 huda: I think like from there I don't know if it's like easy. I'm sure it's not easy, but like I'm kind of just like reaching out on like 475 00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.570 huda: or like, maybe 476 00:52:14.595 --> 00:52:16.559 huda: I can ask. 477 00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:28.459 huda: Actually, like, I had a good idea. So maybe maybe like some finding like websites that I I feel like could get like a makeover or something like that, and just like kind of ask if if they'd be willing. 478 00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:33.629 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a really good idea, especially like small business, like small businesses in your area, like 479 00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:41.659 Jenny Duan: loop this in with full cliff like it could be like similar cause. For, like different different methods. Right? Like, I think that's that's good. 480 00:52:42.467 --> 00:52:45.629 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, sounds good to me. 481 00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:52.009 Jenny Duan: and I guess. Do you have any other questions about how this is gonna work? 482 00:52:54.480 --> 00:53:00.309 Jenny Duan: Like, do you? Do you wanna start like looking at people on Linkedin, or like, how confident are you. 483 00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:05.940 huda: Yeah, I think maybe like looking at like the kind of people that I can look look at in Linkedin. 484 00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:12.579 Jenny Duan: Why don't we do that now? Why don't we find like 5 people just to get you on a start? And then you could do the rest of yourself. 485 00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:13.265 huda: Yeah. 486 00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.730 huda: Okay. Hmm. 487 00:53:29.717 --> 00:53:30.910 huda: So maybe like. 488 00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:42.900 Jenny Duan: I would actually look at like business sch",
    "ool people like look for like cause. If you just look founder like you're getting too big of a range of people like. 489 00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.700 Jenny Duan: does that? Does that make sense. 490 00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.680 huda: Yes. 491 00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:48.109 Jenny Duan: So maybe try like 492 00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:51.959 Jenny Duan: I would, I would go for, like 493 00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.290 Jenny Duan: Stanford, Mba. Like Stanford, Gsb. 494 00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:58.220 Jenny Duan: Start there. 495 00:54:22.335 --> 00:54:24.314 huda: Is js, like a business. 496 00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:28.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's like the graduate school of business. That's what it stands for. 497 00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:11.259 huda: Wait. Am I leaving for like someone in. 498 00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.459 huda: and a startup or. 499 00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:25.059 Jenny Duan: Look at the Sanford Gsb. And look at their businesses. So it's not gonna say like, Oh, I'm in a startup. But you can see like like this business was started like really recently. So 500 00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.270 Jenny Duan: it's 501 00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:38.890 Jenny Duan: oh, I think, Gsb, not Jsp, sorry. I did not say that clearly the graduate school of business. Gsb, like the letter B, 502 00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:47.180 Jenny Duan: like that. You see how. Okay. You see how that 1st option, like founder Stanford, Gsb, that's the type of person you want to look for like someone who's like 503 00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:51.709 Jenny Duan: in business school, but like their founder, like A AI productivity app 504 00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.379 Jenny Duan: perfect.

    "e.

Like, if you look at Farah's 602 01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:08.009 Jenny Duan: website, that's the one like Fara Bakari dot world like in the Ek guy thing like that's an interactive like is circles. And like her fairest principles like that's also kind of interactive like they stack on top of each other 603 01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:11.229 Jenny Duan: like stuff like that, I think, is cool 604 01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.610 Jenny Duan: and like little animations. You can code in 605 01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:18.210 Jenny Duan: that like that look pretty cool. Yeah. 606 01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:26.177 huda: Yeah, I think also, my sister does like like ui design, so I could probably ask her to like, make one for me. 607 01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:34.189 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, you guys, could, all you guys could team up, you and your sister could start like a web design consulting business like she could do the design 608 01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:44.530 Jenny Duan: like, I think this is not too hard like I'm pretty sure this is not. This is just an animation like embedded in, which shouldn't be too hard to like, do once you have the animation. 609 01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.560 Jenny Duan: and then like, see those cards up there? They were like stacking, which not these these ones. I see that. 61",
    "0 01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.930 huda: Yeah. 611 01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.749 Jenny Duan: That's pretty cool. 612 01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.070 huda: Really cool. 613 01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.610 Jenny Duan: Can look at the rest of her website like it's. 614 01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.140 Jenny Duan: is this, like her resume?

I think I think you could strongly consider beyond sts. Applying as a design major, too. If you're interested in this, I don't know if you would actually like design, because it's kind of physical like it's evolves a lot of hands on like mechanical engineering. But like it is cool like this, this person's a design, major. But she didn't build her website like her friend, built it for her, but. 623 01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:46.560 Jenny Duan: Did the design for it. 624 01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:49.364 huda: Yeah, this totally makes sense that she's in design, like. 625 01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:55.639 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like she designed it, but like someone else, coded it.
