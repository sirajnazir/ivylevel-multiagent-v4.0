A


2
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.930
Srinidhi R: Hi!


3
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.059
Jenny Duan: Hey! How's it going? Can you hear me?


4
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.040
Erin Ye: I can hear you


5
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.800
Jenny Duan: awesome


6
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.570
Jenny Duan: supervision. We moved.


7
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.329
Srinidhi R: It's nice to meet you as well


8
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.650
Jenny Duan: for a couple minutes. Are your parents planning to join to day's call? Just kidding?


9
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.610
Srinidhi R: I'm sorry.


10
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.829
Jenny Duan: Are your parents planning to join to day's call as well, no.


11
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:53.340
Jenny Duan: Okay. Awesome. Well, I think. I'm Jenni. It's really nice to meet you. I'll give you some context for how this call is. Gonna go, and then we can just get started. Sirage. Do you have anything to preface it before you get started?


12
00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:06.590
Ivylevel: Yeah, Shirin. Actually, it would have been great if your parents could have joined I mean, are they able to join like later in the in the call as well? Or I can let my mom know my dad has a commitment, but I can let my mom know when she can join


13
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:24.219
Ivylevel: she can come, sit with me. Is that. Okay with you? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, actually, it would be really good. And especially a mom. So hands on. And yeah, so please, yeah, feel free to invite her. Take your time. No worries. Hi, Adrienne! How are you?


14
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:36.879
Erin Ye: Hi! I'm good. How are you? Amazing? Yeah, thanks for joining. And Jenny, and and you all are enjoying your family day today. I know that. Yeah, it's been a nice weekend.


15
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.740
Ivylevel: amazing. So II would imagine, like good food and all that stuff? Right? So


16
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.880
Ivylevel: that's good.


17
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.840
Ivylevel: Yeah.


18
00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:09.959
Ivylevel: Okay. My mom said that she will be here in a couple of minutes. Sure, sure, no worries. Yeah, I? So I think, yeah, you you guys have already introduced. But I also wanted to. Yeah, I mean, you guys can get started. I think when your mom comes, and I'll probably just do a quick round of like, you know, give her like a context. So I don't wanna waste your time. So yeah, please get started, Jenny.


19
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:27.489
Jenny Duan: Awesome. So it's really nice. And you know, I'm Jenny. I'm a current sophomore at Stanford, where I'm sitting symbolic systems, which is an interdisciplinary major that combines computer science, psychology and philosophy. I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, but


20
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:41.399
Jenny Duan: in the Bay Area, obviously for school, so really excited to work with you. I've been helping students for about a year and a half, almost 2 years now. And it's been a really great process. So I'd love to hear a little bit more about


21
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:58.549
Jenny Duan: you. And then how the structure of today's call is gonna go is, I'm gonna spend about 40 min. Ish asking you questions and just having a really natural conversation trying to get to know you and your interest that way, that later, when we prepare report. We're able to give personalized recommendations for


22
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:16.450
Jenny Duan: you know how you can best position yourself in terms of the college application process awards, extra particulars, and other things as well, and then at the end, I'll leave about 15 to 20 min for you to ask any questions you might have regarding your application, your positioning or just anything about Stanford or college in general. How does that sound?


23
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:32.230
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's perfect. Thank you. Awesome. Well, I'd love to get started just by hearing self introduction from you if you could just share maybe you know where you're from, what year in. And then any specific interest or any concerns you might have just right off the bat.


24
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:58.080
Srinidhi R: Okay, my name is Trina B. I'm a junior. I go to high school here in Chantley, Virginia, and I actually attend 2 high schools. One would be my consider my home high school, and the other would be the academies of Loudon, which is a specialized school for research that you have to test into, and I've been attending it since my freshman year, and I will be rounding off with my senior year.


25
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.489
Srinidhi R: So one of the hallmarks of the Academies of Loudin is that you need to complete a Junior Senior research project.


26
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:20.930
So this year I'm doing a project on autism and figuring out whether a certain supplement can help with learning and memory. And next year I will be doing a machine learning project, and so


27
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:46.409
Srinidhi R: II guess my main concern with my college application would be. I have done a decent amount of things, but they don't. They don't really fit together. Very well. For example, I only recently found out that I wanted to do computer science as my major. So I haven't really done many extra curriculars with a focus of computer science.


28
00:06:46.690 --> 00:07:07.329
Srinidhi R: So, for example, I'm the editor in chief of the school newspaper. I'm on the management of the Yearbook, but both of those don't really have much to do with the majors that I'm planning on taking, and I guess, and I'm in like honor societies. But again, I'm not in the relevant ones. I'm in national honor, society, English math and science.


29
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:20.440
Srinidhi R:  I have done volunteer hours. I have over a hundred, but there aren't in relation to computer science. And I have have conducted charity bake so.


30
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.160
But that was for donations to the down syndrome down Syndrome Federation of India.


31
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.420
Srinidhi R: So again, all of this


32
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:40.800
there, there are parts that I can put for my college application. But I'm not sure where they would fit into my narrative. Also, my mom's here.


33
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:59.749
Ivylevel: Hello, everyone! Good to see you all. I'll be here. Let me know if you have any questions for me. Yeah, II just wanted to like, you know, touch, base, and you know, kind of set the context for this particular call. What I did was based on the profile information that you provided I actually


34
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:09.340
Ivylevel: you know. So we brought in. Typically, we only have like one coach, I think. But this was again like, you know, our discussion. It was very special for us, and what we have done is actually, I've brought


35
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:38.159
Ivylevel: 2 very, very amazing coaches. So I've actually had. We've been working with me for the last, you know, one and a half, almost 2 years now. And I've been amazing. They've heard many people, you know. Students get into top schools jenny is our Ca, you know, head coach, and and she has a very interdisciplinary profile which kind of really aligns we spoke about in you know Stanford Csi psychology, you know philosophy. You name it right, and and her she's gonna drive this particular conversation.


36
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:52.409
Ivylevel: And the goal is really to, you know. Bring out, you know, the things that really will help your daughter stand out, Shinidi, right? Which is really not so much the superficial things like not to say that she's not. She's not an excellent thing, but to stand out


37
00:08:52.420 --> 00:09:19.609
Ivylevel: it there has to be some depth. So it's really, Jenny trying to figure out those things. And I've also brought in Erin, who's actually a data science Stanford student as well, and also very interdisciplinary with all the other side of linguist and social sciences. And the reason I brought her in as well, because last year she's really like work with. You know, Econ, you know, political science kind of students really went through the the application and sa kind of journey.


38
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:45.409
Ivylevel: So I think we she's gonna listen in, because, you know, we work as a team right as I told you like. We're not a mentoring flat platform and a tutoring platform. Right? We are really us very hand pick very pro kind of coaches. So we have to discuss and prepare that report in a committee kind of a setup. Right? Then we'll try to match. You know, the the best people you know so that we can take, eventually execute the plan right to help her really shine. So that was kind of


39
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:58.680
Srinidhi R: okay. So I really wanted you to also kind of experience it. And and of course I'm I'm more than happy to send the recording of this particular call so that even can have a look at it.


40
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:22.970
Jenny Duan: I think it's great hearing from your about your interest, and I think something I wanna say straight off the bat is, I think you don't need to be worried about having specific activities that connect directly to your major. Because, ultimately, like colleges know that you're not just a pre professional student. Right? You're someone with a lot of different interests who can contribute to different aspects of the college experience. Whether that's, you know, writing for a school newspaper, for example, like Aaron's on the Stanford Daily team. She does an amazing job


41
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:38.780
Jenny Duan: there, and like you could if you wanted to continue your passion for writing for the newspaper manning the year. But you can definitely do that in college, even if that's not your direct majors. So I think that's something that you don't need to be too worried about. However, I can definitely empathize with that. I think when I was in high school I did a bunch of things.


42
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:51.489
Jenny Duan: things that really weren't related to anything that I felt like I was studying. And I think being able to tell your story is something that we'll talk about. And you know, as I'm getting to know you, I'll try to give you some recommendations for how to do that as well.


43
00:10:51.490 --> 00:11:10.120
Jenny Duan: So the first thing that I'm kind of curious about is you can tell me a little bit more about how your high school system is set up, so I know that you're part of 2 schools. One is competitive. You had to test into it, or you had to, you know. Apply for can you tell me about how your school is structured. So do you attend classes at both these institutions, or how do you manage being in these 2 schools?


44
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:35.329
Srinidhi R: So I attend my home school and the academies allowed in on alternating days, so, like the A. And B. They schedule. So on 8 days I'll attend one school and B days, I'll attend the other. Which means that I will take my math and science courses at the academies of Loud End, because, again, like Research Institute. But then I'll be taking my English history and elective courses at my home school.


45
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:47.160
Srinidhi R: So I have taken the electives. I've taken computer information systems. I'm taking data science. This year. I've taken my language at my home high school.


46
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:56.039
Srinidhi R: And instead of the academies, it's been sophomore Science Research, Junior science, research, Senior Science Research, and so on.


47
00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.979
Jenny Duan: Is this a common thing that that your schools do the dual program?


48
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.349
No. If


49
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:16.110
Srinidhi R: the academies of loud, and has become pretty selective in recent years, so I'd say, only, like a third of the students at my home high School, go to the academies of Loudon.


50
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:27.349
Srinidhi R: But everyone who does go to the Academy so loud and does do the dual enrollment days. So the account is allowed in this only for dual enrollment, so it only goes there full time.


51
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:41.279
Jenny Duan: Got it? And what kind of classes have you taken at at your at both high schools so far like, have you taken Ap's? I know you're taking a language. What language are you taking, and how many years of it have you taken. And what are some of the left is that you've done?


52
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:55.830
Srinidhi R: I took Spanish, but I only took it for 3 years because I think a problem I've had is figure out what classes I'm gonna take, because, unlike, like traditional students with the 8 blocks, I get 4 blocks


53
00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:05.359
Srinidhi R: to choose what I want from my home high school, because the curriculum at the academies is pretty restricted. For example, at the academies you have


54
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:26.730
Srinidhi R: something called integrated science, which technically doesn't count as like a single like biology or chemistry. For in, for example, in freshman year, we did some physics, some chemistry, some astronomy, some Earth science. And then so it's called integrated science one and 2, and then Aos math analysis.


55
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:32.040
Srinidhi R: So that's what I took. Freshman year sophomore year was


56
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.480
Srinidhi R: sorry


57
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:57.170
Srinidhi R: algebra. 2. Trick Aos algebra. 2. Trick was my freshman year course at the academies, and then Aos math analysis was my sophomore year course at the academies along with sophomore science, research and integrated science. 3. This year I'm taking aos calculus ab


58
00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:17.430
Srinidhi R: ap biology. So it's the first ap that I can consider and Junior science research. Meanwhile, at the at my home high school I've taken Spanish for 3 years. I took 2 years in middle school, and one year in freshman year, I've taken the electives of computer science and information science.


59
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:28.830
Srinidhi R: I've taken ap stats. I've taken Ap world history. I'm doing this here. I'm doing apde chemistry. A push.


60
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.330
Srinidhi R: a P. Lang. And I'm taking data science as my elective


61
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.279
Jenny Duan: got it. Do they have Apcs selectives, or is that not something offered?


62
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.959
We have Apcs selectives at the


63
00:14:43.080 --> 00:15:04.370
Srinidhi R: at my home high school. But again, since I only figured out that I wanted to do it this year. I think I missed out on taking them. You need to do computer math as a prerequisite for Ap. Comp. Science A, and they don't offer Apom science principles here. So I'm actually going to take Ap computer science A, my senior year.


64
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:12.509
Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that's totally fine. If you take it your senior year, I don't think that should be a big barrier to you. And


65
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:18.700
Jenny Duan: I think with the ap calculus program at, do you get to take the Ap. Test or no?


66
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:24.860
Srinidhi R: We can. I'm actually planning on self studying and taking the Ap calculus BC test.


67
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:32.139
Srinidhi R: So I'm doing the Ab. Class at school and taking the Vc. Test as my.


68
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:40.740
Jenny Duan: And then what would that mean for your math? Next year I would take ap calculus BC. Like at school.


69
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.310
Jenny Duan: But are you taking the I guess. Ap exam this year or next year?


70
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:53.709
Srinidhi R: This year. So next year II if I do. Well, this year, I don't plan on taking the Ap. BC. Exam. Next year. I'll just take the class.


71
00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:06.660
Jenny Duan: Got it, and are there on the other upper level math options, for example, if you do well, if you examine this year, then I think that demonstrates that, like you know, the Vc. Concept. So would there be another class you'd be able to take in that case or no


72
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.609
Srinidhi R: there's aos multivariable calculus


73
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.180
Srinidhi R: that I could take


74
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:21.360
Srinidhi R: Technically, you are supposed to take Vc. In order to take the multivariable exam. But I think I could talk to my counselor and


75
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.990
Srinidhi R: test it if I had to


76
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:31.360
Jenny Duan: got it cool. I'm curious why you chose to go to the Academy of Loud and like what was your


77
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.050
what was your thought process behind that. And like.


78
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.519
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I guess one there.


79
00:16:37.310 --> 00:17:01.450
Srinidhi R: So we I've heard about the academies, Aladdin, since I was in middle school, and the main thing we've heard is that it's a research institution. So you have to complete research projects. And I've I like the process of research. I like the whole data gathering. And Al data analysis writing a conclusion. II write, I like writing lab reports and final papers.


80
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:14.170
Srinidhi R: So when I heard about the Academy of Loud, and I figured that I was already meeting the requirements. For example, you had to have completed algebra 2 trig. I was


81
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.710
Srinidhi R: I was


82
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.139
Srinidhi R: sorry I forgot the word.


83
00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:30.140
Srinidhi R: I was ahead of my peers, and I had already taken the class. So I was, and I was always interested in research. So I thought I could test in. And yeah, I guess that would be it.


84
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:38.430
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's super cool. Can you tell me a little bit about what research projects you've been able to do, starting from freshman year to to year. Now.


85
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:57.850
Srinidhi R: so freshman year and sophomore year, you don't really have the opportunity to work on research projects. There's always many projects like we had a biochemistry unit. We there was a Radon unit. So there's all. But they don't really classify as projects this year is my first main project.


86
00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:12.110
Srinidhi R: I'm doing. I have the opportunity to publish a paper for a science journal at the end of the year, and this year I'm doing the pro. I'm doing a project on a fruit flyest drosophila, melanogaster


87
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:19.050
Srinidhi R: and seeing the effect of delimiting citrus oil peel


88
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:29.429
Srinidhi R: on the effect of learning and memory of Asd infuse induced flies. So that would be my project this year. Next year I'm planning on doing a machine learning project.


89
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:36.930
I haven't exactly decided what, but I will have to soon like within the next month. So that's in the works


90
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:44.319
Jenny Duan: cool? And did you get to choose your own product topics, or were they more assigned to you? And who are your mentors for these projects?


91
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:53.879
Srinidhi R: So we got to develop our own project. That is essentially what sophomore science research was all about. You spent an entire semester just


92
00:18:53.910 --> 00:19:02.209
figuring out a project and going through what they call the signature process. So you had to go through, I think, 3 different teachers


93
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:30.470
Srinidhi R: to and they had to give their approval. They would give you assignments to make sure you actually knew what you were asking and they would help you figure it out. A research project that you could enter it in Junior Year this year. My mentor is Dr. Eliason. She has a strong background in neuroscience, and she has worked with melanogaster for many years now. So she is. My mentor


94
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.870
Jenny Duan: got it.


95
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.970
Jenny Duan: And


96
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.910
Jenny Duan: curious what inspired you to start this project.


97
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:51.360
So I my brother is autistic. So I've always had a personal history with autism. And so especially learning and memory, I've seen what like the first couple of years. Have


98
00:19:51.500 --> 00:20:16.610
Srinidhi R: you know, perhaps, how they have set my brother back compared to his peers. So I was. I was always interested not to some end, especially when I found out that you know the reasons why there are lags and learn learning and memory, and how there are certain supplements that haven't been tested yet, but theoretically point to a possible like not cure, but a possible, you know.


99
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:25.039
Srinidhi R: supplement for treating learning and memory and improving it. So I guess that's why I went with my project this year.


100
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:36.169
Jenny Duan: Cool? Yeah. That's that's really awesome, especially that you have a personal connection. To the topic. And and that's really great, that it's something that you know effects


101
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.659
Jenny Duan: your story. And hopefully, your research can make a contribution to that space.


102
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:58.240
Jenny Duan: I'd like to learn more about. You know, earlier you mentioned that you're involved in this school newspaper, your manager of the yearbook you talked about. You know your different honor societies. I'm wondering if you could tell me a little bit about. You know what you're involved in outside of research. Maybe we can start with the school newspaper in the yearbook and then go from there.


103
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:10.869
Srinidhi R: Okay, so I've been on the school newspaper since my freshman year. So I was a staff writer. I submitted articles. They have a website. And so a lot of my articles have been put on the website.


104
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:35.390
Srinidhi R: And I actually got promoted this year to Co. Editor in chief of the school newspaper. So now I manage. I manage the entire team of staff writers I organize. We are figuring out how to best advertise the school newspaper. So I figured that out. I have. I figure out a way to best represent us on like


105
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:52.249
Srinidhi R: the Yearbook platform. For example, I organized school wide competitions and like literary and poetry and drawing. And you know, basically we were they. We came up with a prompt and we had people like send their submissions


106
00:21:52.320 --> 00:22:04.479
Srinidhi R: for like prizes. So I organized that like with by making flyers creating a morning announcements like speech, and so on.


107
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:22.210
Srinidhi R: And the yearbook. I'm actually on the management for the first time this year. And so I'm in charge of coming up with ideas of how to fill the pages so recently. We've had a thing called a lease for car show. So I've developed a possible template to use


108
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:37.360
Srinidhi R: with a caption some pictures, and I organized the world at large, spread. So, looking at all the world events, and figuring out short blurbs and designing a page that would have all of those old blurbs.


109
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:38.920
Srinidhi R: So yeah.


110
00:22:40.140 --> 00:23:02.960
Jenny Duan: cool. And then beyond that, you also mentioned that you're involved in honors, societies? In a couple of societies. What does your involvement look like? And how much time does that entail? So I'm in for honor societies, and mostly what I do is volunteer hours. So I volunteer at the Academic support center after schools on Tuesdays and Thursdays whenever I can.


111
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.060
Srinidhi R: and


112
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:22.189
Srinidhi R: that we don't really have many opportunities. Beyond that I have one of the activities in national Audit society was making cards for the hospital in like during the winter season. So I did that


113
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:27.310
Srinidhi R: But beyond that the only real volunteer opportunity we have is


114
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:33.169
Srinidhi R: like, I said, volunteering after school as a student tutor at the Academic Support center.


115
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.689
Srinidhi R: So I've been doing that


116
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.379
Jenny Duan: cool and just curious, like.


117
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:52.270
Jenny Duan: what? what else do you have to do as an as an Nhs member or as a member of these other owners. Is it just volunteering, or do you have to be involved in your explore related club planning events, or anything like that.


118
00:23:53.010 --> 00:24:10.189
Srinidhi R: No. And actually, in all of these aren't societies. It's just you need to meet the minimum volunteer requirement for English Arms society, for example, I need to have, I think, 3 or 4 h math on a society. I need to have 5 h per quarter.


119
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:20.890
Srinidhi R: Nhs would be like 25 h over the year. So all of these don't really require me to be anywhere else. But just, you know, submitting volunteer hours


120
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:32.410
Jenny Duan: cool and then are you involved with any of your own volunteering initiatives. So beyond helping out with, you know, academic tutoring or other existing organizations. Are you involved in any like self initiative volunteering


121
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:45.960
Srinidhi R: last summer I actually organized a charity bake sale for the downtown Federation of India. So we established a customer base came up with a list of desserts. I made the desserts.


122
00:24:45.960 --> 00:25:04.980
Srinidhi R: packed them, figured out the delivering system, and then collected all of the money that donated to the Downside in Federation of India, and that allowed many people to attend the Downside Room Conference, which provided them with better opportunities of you know, and information regarding down syndrome.


123
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.570
Srinidhi R: and that was actually, that's really impressive.


124
00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:21.960
Jenny Duan: No, it was just that was actually my the summer between sophomore and junior year of high school got it? And how much money did you end up raising?


125
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.410
Srinidhi R: Anywhere between?


126
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.909
Srinidhi R: Excuse me, between, how much? For 4, 400


127
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:34.119
Srinidhi R: dollars? Yeah, 2,000 2,000 $2,000. Sorry.


128
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:41.530
Jenny Duan: cool and have you been involved with the downstream Federation of India for a long time, or is this your first engagement with them.


129
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:59.699
Srinidhi R: Actually, their founder is within our like family friends Circle. So we've always been aware of the Federation. But this is the first time that I have actually contributed to the charity organization.


130
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:13.570
Jenny Duan: Cool and then beyond these extra circular items, are there any other areas in which you spend your time like in these sports, music, dance, or any other activities, clubs, anything else that you spend time doing?


131
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:18.140
Srinidhi R: Not really honestly, between school and


132
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.579
Srinidhi R: mostly school. I don't. I don't really do much outside


133
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:30.850
Jenny Duan: cool. Yeah, I think research is definitely like a big project for you. And I'm sure that takes up a lot of time. Does that involve a lot of extra


134
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.769
Jenny Duan: time outside of school?


135
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:34.920
Mostly, if


136
00:26:35.400 --> 00:27:04.639
Srinidhi R: it it really depends on so not much in like the first half of each quarter, but in the second half, if your data isn't collected, you need to bring your like flies home so you could do the assays at home. If you need to finalize your papers at home like my background paper, my experimental design paper, all of those you can do outside of class, because in class we have access to equipment, and you don't really have that anywhere else. So it's mostly just you know what deadlines up here when


137
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:13.469
Jenny Duan: got it? That makes a lot of sense just going back to the school aspect. I'm curious. Have you taken any standardized testing. And how has that gone for you?


138
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:27.370
Srinidhi R: I took the sat and I took 2 ap exams and the sat on the Ap. Exams. I took them sophomore year of high school. I got a 4 on ap statistics and 5 on ap world history.


139
00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.770
and


140
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:35.549
Srinidhi R: I took the sat twice, and my latest score was a 1550 in December.


141
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:42.580
Jenny Duan: Awesome. And have you taken the psat? Or like the Mspt. For national merit?


142
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:54.760
Srinidhi R: Yes, I took that, too, and I qualified for I passed the initial qualification for the Nms. Qt. And I haven't. We have won't hear about the next stage until September.


143
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.909
Jenny Duan: Cool. What was your score?


144
00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.510
Srinidhi R: 219, I believe.


145
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.020
Jenny Duan: Number that is like a


146
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.750
Jenny Duan: 14 or 15 something.


147
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:11.330
Srinidhi R: Yeah, I'll send you in a minute I'll send you in a minute.


148
00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:17.380
Jenny Duan: Sorry no worries. Take your time, and then, just curious like, how are your grades going for you?


149
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:27.110
Srinidhi R: My grades have been pretty pretty good. I have an unweighted Gpa. Of 4.3 5 and a weighted of


150
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:38.519
Srinidhi R: 3.9 5 they were doing. Oh, so my Pst, score was a 1430, and the index score was a 2 17.


151
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.600
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Sounds good.


152
00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:43.710
Jenny Duan: And


153
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.569
Jenny Duan: so your Gpa is like a different 9, 5 unweighted, 4.3 5 later.


154
00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:59.549
Jenny Duan: And do you know how that do you know what how you're doing compared to your peers, not in like a competitive way, like. But just how are you? Do you know how you, if you're you know?


155
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.530
Jenny Duan: Especially, we'll take around the same level questions with you where people take more Ap's or less


156
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:24.570
Srinidhi R: I think it really depends on whether I'm being counted against my home, just my home high school people, or the people who are also attending the academies because definitely compared against the people at my home high school I'm taking, not like less Ap's. But like there's been less opportunities for electives and stuff


157
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:38.350
Srinidhi R: just because I don't have any like blocks to spare for taking those Ap's. But compared to the people that attend the Academy. So Latin with me, I'm pretty much on par with them on the amount of Ap's I've taken, and so on


158
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.889
Jenny Duan: cool. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.


159
00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:52.469
Jenny Duan: Now, I'm curious, like you said that you have a recent switch from your interest to knowing that you wanted to major in computer science. Can you tell me about one side to switch and what you were thinking about majoring before


160
00:29:52.820 --> 00:30:15.159
Srinidhi R: I was planning on majoring in again. Research. I when I was younger I always wanted to figure out a cure for autism. So I was leaning towards research, which is why I actually attended the Academy Science, because I applied to both the academies of engineering and technology and the Academies of Science, and I got into both.


161
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:30.039
Srinidhi R: And I went for the Academy of Science, because I always figured I would go into healthcare and medical research. And actually I changed my mind because when I saw the growing field of computer science.


162
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:55.570
Srinidhi R: and also because I've always liked, I've always liked history, and I've always wanted to figure out a way to incorporate that into my career. So I was researching courses that would or jobs that would require both, like a history, sort of aspect and a computer science aspect. And I found intelligence


163
00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:10.710
Srinidhi R: analysis. So that involves like I could possibly major in international relations, which isn't exactly history. But it is part of you know, it's it's somewhere around where I wanna go and a major in computer science as well.


164
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:30.009
Jenny Duan: Oh, that sounds that's all really interesting. And something I can definitely think about is, first of all, there's like a lot of computer science research, too. And with doing computer science, there's an opportunity for you to combine your passion for science research with computer science, too. So, for example, going into bioinformatics or


165
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:55.560
Jenny Duan: going into like combining Cs and Bio is, is a really growing field that I think you can take opportunity. So I think first, that's one thing to be aware of, and also with intelligence. Are you interested in becoming like an FBI CIA agent? What do you mean by intelligence? You mean cyber security? Do you mean more like forensics? What type of intelligence or national security is like, what type of intelligence you mean?


166
00:31:55.610 --> 00:32:08.060
Srinidhi R: My dream is to work for the National for the Nsa. So I would mostly. Just so it's like you said national security intelligence. Just, you know, analyzing things like that.


167
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.020
yeah.


168
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:39.720
Jenny Duan: that's cool. I think you actually have a really great background for this. I think having research skills, especially in a specialized field, will make you a good candidate actually, like, 2 weeks ago I went to the FBI in San Francisco for a tour, and met a lot of their agents there, and they actually come from all different backgrounds. So you know, there's people with science Phds in the FBI who are doing like security work like probably stuff that you'd be interested in. There's people from social science backgrounds. There's people from history, from like molecular bios, psychology like


169
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:55.099
Jenny Duan: computer science, all different backgrounds. So I think if if that's your target career path, think, being able to have a very specialized area of expertise would be good for you. Whether that's a computer science, bummatics, biology, or something different. I think.


170
00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:17.910
Jenny Duan: I also am curious about learning more about your future goals in terms of like colleges. Have I know that your juniors is probably top of mind right now. For you. But I'm curious, you know. Do you know, what type of school do you want to go to like? Do you want to go to Liberal Arts College, a big State school research institution. And do you know where you want to be for college, whether that's like a specific school or a geographical region.


171
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:29.910
Srinidhi R: I don't. I don't mind as much for the geographical region. I would like to stay somewhere on the East coast, or like east coast adjacent, just because it's close to home. But


172
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:34.530
I don't mind as much for the geographical region and


173
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:42.760
Srinidhi R: for us, for, like colleges, I narrowed down. I wanna go to either like Brown University or Yale University.


174
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.270
Srinidhi R: So


175
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:47.490
Srinidhi R: it's.


176
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:57.160
And then beyond that, like a Liberal arts, college would also probably serve me well, especially for like international relations.


177
00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.930
Srinidhi R: But beyond that I just I really don't know.


178
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:12.759
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm curious, like I. What is your priority between like a school with a really good Liberal Arts program versus a really good stem program. Because I know, like a lot of, for example, schools,


179
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.389
Jenny Duan: don't have as great like Cs major programs or like engineering programs. So they have better engine


180
00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:28.820
Jenny Duan: like Ir or liberal arts programs, and also vice versa, like a lot of really great Cs schools don't maybe have as robust Ir programs.


181
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:52.580
Jenny Duan: I know, for example, like one school, I would think on this Georgetown, like Georgetown, is, you know, super close to the DC. Area, has it? Great international relations program has a great like international studies like just entire department like lots of connections, like as the States and other organizations like that. But, like the Cs. And engineering is not as strong, so internal, like priority. What? What do you think you prioritize in an institution?


182
00:34:53.110 --> 00:35:02.430
Srinidhi R: I think. I'm not sure this is actually the smartest course of action, but I do think I prioritize liberal arts over computer science.


183
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:08.209
Srinidhi R: mostly because I really do enjoy history. And I,


184
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:18.400
Srinidhi R: while I would major in both of them, I think I would like, slightly enjoy my international relations, Major, over my computer science major.


185
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.620
Jenny Duan: cool. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me. I'm curious, like, how did you know that you're interested in history? And what kind of spark your questions for this area?


186
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:36.750
Srinidhi R: I've always been interested in history ever since I was like really young in fact, like on road trips, me and my dad would spend the entire like


187
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:54.869
Srinidhi R: what 4 or 5 h like in the car just talking about the Industrial Revolution, the Gilded Age. I was always passionate about Greek mythology, Roman mythology, Egyptian mythology, and then I


188
00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:10.119
Srinidhi R: so I've always been interested in history, and I always figured I've always leaned towards taking harder history courses just because I always found them more interesting, and I've always done pretty well on them.


189
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.640
Srinidhi R: For example, my freshman year. I haven't taken an honors


190
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:31.749
Srinidhi R: history course, I think, ever since I entered high school. I took the Pre. Ap world history. I took ap world history. I took a push this year, and next year I'll be taking Ap. Comp. Gov. And Usgov. So I've always been interested in history as a kid


191
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:49.539
Jenny Duan: cool. That makes a lot of sense to me. I actually think, like there are some programs I know of that could be a really good fit for you. For example. At Yale University. There's this major called. Let me share my screen really quickly. So you're able to see us. Well, there's this major called


192
00:36:49.690 --> 00:37:16.740
Jenny Duan: I major in history of science, Medicine, and public Health, which is an interdisciplinary program that combat that focuses on how different forms of knowledge and technology have been created at various times, places and cultures, and how they've shaped the modern world. I think I don't know if this is something that you'd be interested in, but sounds like a program like this is very, very aligned with your interest in like doing research in science, in medicine. And you know the questions that this major asks are like, what is the relationship between medical expertise, social structure and everyday life.


193
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:27.729
Jenny Duan: So it seems like it covers like the scientific revolution, like health activism, public health, global health and epidemics technology which would bring out that Cs aspect. If you wanted to do more of that


194
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:46.789
Jenny Duan: and then the historical development of physical, environmental, biological, and human sciences. And this major is the foundation for career at the intersection of the sciences, technology and public life, including law, business journalism, help museum, board, public policy, government, and others which I think this could be like a good fit for you.


195
00:37:46.970 --> 00:38:04.240
Jenny Duan: if this is something that you're interested in, and I'm sure as you know, we continue to to develop your profile and get more specific about you. We can find similar majors at Brown and other institutions as well. Is this, does this sound like the direction that you would want to go into like hyper specific? Or would you like to go broader?


196
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.680
Srinidhi R: No, this sounds. This sounds really good. Actually.


197
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:34.569
Jenny Duan: yeah, because I think like something that I didn't realize when I was going into college is that there are programs that are very specific to whatever you want to work on. So there's no like, for example, for me. I always knew I was very interested in artificial intelligence, but understanding that not only from the computer science perspective, but also from, you know, the psychology of philosophy and more human sociology side, too. And so that's one of the reasons why I chose to go to Stanford is because there was a major that was very hyper specific to


198
00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:57.969
Jenny Duan: my interest, that I couldn't find anywhere else, and I think this is something that I wanna share with you is that you know you might think that your activities are too broad, or that they don't fit into a certain category or major. But if you if we do research, we can find very specific programs like this one at a school that you're very interested in. That might be a perfect fit actually for your background, your story. And like what you wanna do, which I think this falls into.


199
00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:04.770
Jenny Duan:  So yeah, that's just like a little preview. But I think there's definitely more


200
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:09.480
Jenny Duan: more that we can do in this space. I'm curious, like.


201
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:25.369
Jenny Duan: what are your plans for the summer? Because II think one of the things that I kind of noticed in your profile is that you don't quite have a lot of activities. And I know that. You know school is very busy for you. So I think one of the goals that we can work on is finding some sort of


202
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:36.670
Jenny Duan: lower lift. But higher impact program for you to take advantage of. For example, things that don't take up too much of your time, but activities in which you can make a big contribution or impact in subfield.


203
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:48.169
Jenny Duan: So I think, like some activities, it's one thing that's kind of the same from your profile, but it's something we can definitely bring started and work on. But curious like extending this to the summer. Do you have any summer plans already?


204
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:50.480
Srinidhi R: I'm


205
00:39:50.520 --> 00:40:08.719
Srinidhi R: planning. I'm so going to sign up for girls who code for a program in that I'm taking 2 college courses at Nova, one in Python and one in Java this summer. And I plan on organizing another charity. Donation. Collect.


206
00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:25.070
Srinidhi R: It's not. I'm not like 100% sure in my plan yet. But I have started collecting money, and it's going to that it's going again to India. And this time. It's for security to install security cameras at a school.


207
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:33.679
Jenny Duan: Okay? Cool. So I'm curious like, why, you're deciding to take more college classes in the summer.


208
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:59.319
Srinidhi R:  I again, because I figured since I wasn't II didn't actually do much, for II figured since I just realized about the computer science Major, that I should probably compensate for the time that I lost. So I'm taking Python and Java to as like a solid foundation for Co. Coding languages, I should probably know.


209
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:12.029
Srinidhi R: And also because I'm planning on taking computer science a senior year. But I'll have to test in. So I think with a college, you know, a college course, I'd be able to have that strong foundation to do. Well.


210
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:17.660
Jenny Duan: I haven't already taken data science and another intro to computer science class at your school.


211
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:28.700
Srinidhi R: The computer science and the computer information science. That was mostly focusing on Powerpoint word and excel as well as like business skills.


212
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:44.059
Srinidhi R: And that was freshman year data. Science involves like data analysis. But this is, it's been very, you know, surface level. We've done python. So I do have some experience in python. But it's been more as like.


213
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:58.809
Srinidhi R: here is a set of data, just plot, some graphs, whichever graphs you think can best analyze the data and then come up with a you know, a conclusion about it, and like a paper and write up or so on, got it


214
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:06.790
Jenny Duan: so I think my advice for you right off the bat is, I would say, don't do those 2 courses. I think it would be a waste of your time to do that because


215
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:25.789
Jenny Duan: One reason one thing we can think about is you don't need to be a professional in a subject to major in in college. And that's actually like your expertise in a certain areas not required to study it in college, especially especially given that you wanna focus on something more interdisciplinary that maybe doesn't have Cs at the forefront.


216
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:50.170
Jenny Duan: You know you're not majoring in Cs. You may be majoring in an interest, major, or something that combines Ir and Cs and security, or something like that. So I think there's no reason, for you to spend that much time now the trade off here isn't necessarily that you're not capable of, or that you can't do. Cs. It's more that that time is very, very precious, and because I think you have so little space between, you know right now in your college application that it wouldn't be worth it


217
00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:59.390
Jenny Duan: to strengthen your experience in Cs. I think that if you want to learn cs, there's definitely a lot of online courses like this one is one that I did pipe for e.com. It's like


218
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:16.259
Jenny Duan: really straightforward way to learn python. I think it's quite effective. But another thing that we can remember is in college. There's a reason why, there's introduction to computer science. That class is required for, like every Cf major at Stanford and met every other school, and Stanford and other schools, wouldn't even


219
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:39.530
Jenny Duan: wouldn't require this class for every Cs major if they expected every Cs major to come in learning Cs, because otherwise like, if everyone came in a pro. I went there for studying, there'd be no point for them to take those classes in college. So I think colleges recognize that like you could have curiosity in a subject, and that's enough for you. Don't wanna major in it, and you don't necessarily need to be a pro in something to major in college. So I think


220
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:43.520
Jenny Duan: because of that, I probably wouldn't recommend you doing


221
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:52.460
Jenny Duan: that those 2 classes. I think if you want to do more computer science things. I think bills to code is a great program. Another really good program is code of coffee.


222
00:43:52.480 --> 00:44:10.099
Jenny Duan: This link didn't hyperlink. But this is another. It's a 2 week summer program and they have camps in web development, mobile app development, AI and data science. And I think this is like a really great community for you to discover other people who are interested in coding and to learn some other straightforward coding skills as well.


223
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:34.989
Jenny Duan: So I think. Those are some other resources like the and code of coffee that I'd recommend you take advantage of, rather than focusing your time on taking those call classes, because that's gonna be very time extensive, and it may not have the payoff that you would expect instead, I would recommend applying for summer programs. I don't think it's too late to do that, especially if you have a research background. One program that I would recommend is


224
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.370
Jenny Duan: Let me put it in the


225
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.070
as well


226
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.279
Jenny Duan: is, let me see.


227
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.509
Jenny Duan: when the application deadline is, I believe this is still yeah.


228
00:44:45.550 --> 00:45:11.299
Jenny Duan: The applications are still open. This is a research program at Nyu, I would definitely recommend you apply for it's specifically for girls interested in computer science. And it's a research project. So if you want to learn to do computer science research, which might be an area that you're interested in applying for a program like this would be really effective because it allows you to apply your existing research background into a new skillset or new domain that you're interested in, which in this case of computer science.


229
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:35.339
Jenny Duan: I don't think it's too late for you to apply for proper summer programs. If that's something that you're interested in. However, I do wanna emphasize the urgency of these programs because many of the deadlines are coming up within the next, either one week, 2 weeks, or one month like beyond this program. There's other programs that have March first deadline that. Honestly, if you started now, I don't think it would be too late for you to apply, for I just think it would be like a very


230
00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:43.299
Jenny Duan: quick turnaround that you would have you take advantage of if you wanted to go to summer program route, which I think summer programs are quite


231
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:54.399
Jenny Duan: important, because, first of all, they give you practice writing essays, which is good for the college application. But also, they connect you with other resources. So other students, different institutions. And


232
00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:10.190
Jenny Duan: that's other programs, that and other opportunities that you can take advantage of, for example, like through this program, publishing a paper doing research with Nyu faculty and other things. So I think going this summer program, or at least applying for them, and then deciding whether or not you actually want to commit to them could be a good thing.


233
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:17.929
Jenny Duan: For you to do. But this is very. This is like a very fast turnaround. So I think if you wanted to commit to applying for these programs, it is


234
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:31.719
Jenny Duan: something that would require a lot of crunch within the next, like one to 2 weeks to ensure that you are able to submit these applications by the deadline and then the other thing that I wanted to highlight is with your fundraising thing.


235
00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:54.709
Jenny Duan: It's I think that is also really good. I think that there's an opportunity for to turn that into like a fully formed organization where you could take some type of leadership role as well. Because I think, like right now, you're already doing the work, basically of having an organization like coordinating, organizing, fundraising, and planning everything. But it would be great if we could assign, like a formalized role or


236
00:46:54.710 --> 00:47:04.570
Jenny Duan: title to your work, just to give it a little bit more credibility. But I think that's something that you can also think about for the summer. But I think the most important thing is like


237
00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:23.669
Jenny Duan: that. Timing is really important, just because summer programs are like they're happening right now. And so if you wanna apply, it's pretty urgent, because you know that. And then crafting your profile and everything else will take a lot of time. So it's really important to like start early. So you don't miss the deadlines for these applications like the one I put in the chat.


238
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:46.170
Jenny Duan: I think other than that. The main thing that I do wanna highlight is, I think, that you do need to supplement your profile a little bit with some more extra curriculars, especially to demonstrate, like your leadership and your interest in these roles. I think that you don't need to be too concerned about having a profile that you think is too broad because we can find the major or the program that fits your profile.


239
00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:54.620
Jenny Duan: And I think that that shouldn't be a concern, and the storytelling piece will come later, as you continue to add to your awards, and also


240
00:47:54.620 --> 00:48:12.600
Jenny Duan: extracurricular areas. I think one thing that is really interesting about your profile that really makes you unique is I think this like passion for disability, awareness or learning difference, awareness or neuro divergence. I think that's this is like a really important area that I think you can


241
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:17.470
Jenny Duan: have the opportunity to make a lot of like contributions or leadership in. I'm wondering, like.


242
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:25.459
Jenny Duan: Are you aware of or involved with any other organizations that do any sort of research, advocacy or awareness for people with these conditions?


243
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:26.510
Srinidhi R: Not really.


244
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.899
Jenny Duan: No, okay. I think that that is something that you can definitely


245
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:57.250
Jenny Duan: really spend a lot of time thinking about, because I think like something that I know at Stanford is a lot of students here who are advocates, for you know, people disabilities who are divergent folks are trying to establish a minor in disability studies. And I know that a lot of schools have what we call like institutional priorities, or they have. They make it a priority that they're trying to expand a program in disability studies, or they're trying to expand. You know, advocacy


246
00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:05.790
Jenny Duan: in these types of areas. And what that means is, schools are specifically looking for people that they know will help lead these initiatives or provide support to


247
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:31.829
Jenny Duan: existing like community offices and things like that. And so there, schools are putting like Stanford and other schools are putting more funding in these areas. And I think they're trying to seek students who have these types of backgrounds or interest. And I think, like this is something that you're interested in for seeing in any type of capacity. That's really awesome, because I think one other thing that you mentioned earlier is not really having like a clear why or not having, like a clear


248
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:54.680
Jenny Duan: co set of cohesion for your profile, but I think like adding in a leather layer, advocacy will help enhance like your why? Or like the reason why you pursue these things, and it'll help with your storytelling that you'll need for, like your personal statement and applications for other things. So I think, like definitely on your profile when I'm doing the when we're doing the report. This is something that will give you some


249
00:49:54.780 --> 00:50:13.619
Jenny Duan: recommendations towards. I think that also with the history interest. There's a lot of opportunities for you, especially if you have an existing research background to apply for different writing competitions and awards that might give you more credibility for your passion and international relations and history. Because, yeah, I think, like


250
00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:27.809
Jenny Duan: awards, profiles are usually something that people also under look or under value, but I think like adding in some of those more writing competitions or research competitions could be good for you. I'm curious, like, if you have any awards right now, and if so, what those look like?


251
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:37.979
Srinidhi R:  III don't think anything comes to mind in terms of awards.


252
00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:59.860
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. I do think that awards are pretty major area. I definitely think, like national merit is something that is in your favor. I think. That's awesome. And that will definitely be an important award. I think, like leveraging, trying to leverage your volunteer hours and existing interest to apply for other awards is going to be something else that kind of sets you apart.


253
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:12.229
Jenny Duan:  yeah. So sorry about the volunteer hours. I did get the Presidentials award the Presidential award for completing over 100 h in my sophomore year of high school


254
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:18.559
Jenny Duan: cool? That's awesome. And is that the what like level? Was it gone? Silver, gold! Do you remember


255
00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:25.620
Srinidhi R: it was? I don't think we have the bronze silver, gold at my high school. It was just


256
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.979
Srinidhi R: if you get above a hundred, you get the presidential's one.


257
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:43.780
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. I think that that's also gonna be impactful. So then that means you have opportunities for 3 more awards, because on the common app. There are 5 awards. I think something that you could get involved in is


258
00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:50.739
Jenny Duan: I'm trying to see if it's too late. But I don't. I don't think it's too late is, have you heard of national history day?


259
00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:51.880
Srinidhi R: Hmm.


260
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:56.710
Jenny Duan: okay. National history day is a program where you can.


261
00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:09.560
Jenny Duan: I'll put the I'll put the link. I need to do some more research to see if the the deadline has passed yet. But it's a program in high for high school students to do research about


262
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.080
Jenny Duan: about history and


263
00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:24.379
Jenny Duan: you know, create a create a unique project around that. And it's national competition. It's it's pretty cool. And I think it. They'll give you an opportunity to like pursue history through an independent research if


264
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.149
Jenny Duan: or independent essay, or even like video making project, or something like that.


265
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:37.649
Jenny Duan: something that you'd be interested in. But anyways, all this and other things will be written in your report. So I know I've been like dumping a lot of things in the chat, so feel free to


266
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:41.600
Jenny Duan: you don't have to take notes on them, because I'll include those all in your report.


267
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:53.469
Jenny Duan:  cool. And now I think we have about 10 min left, so I wanna open it up to see if you have any questions, or if your parents have any questions about your profile, interest, or any other concerns?


268
00:52:54.020 --> 00:53:03.049
Srinidhi R: Ii actually don't think I have any questions. I think we covered everything, do you? No, my mom, my mom doesn't have any questions either.


269
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:17.030
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool in that case, then maybe spend a little bit of time going a little bit more deep on your extra curriculum, because I think just looking at your profile. I think this is the area that will probably require the most amount of


270
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:36.319
Jenny Duan: work over the next, you know, couple of weeks months. In order to prepare yourself best for your goals. I think you definitely have a really really strong academic foundation, which is something that is really good, because I think a lot of school, for a lot of students like their academic foundation is what they struggle a lot to most with. And unfortunately, that's


271
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:37.949
Jenny Duan: not something that, like


272
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:50.800
Jenny Duan: you can really change at this point. Given that you're a junior. So it's really good that you have a strong foundation there, especially for schools like Georgetown, which is, you know, not test optional and other schools that have recently reinstated their test


273
00:53:50.820 --> 00:54:14.510
Jenny Duan: required policies. So you have really good standardized testing. But I think what will require the most leverage at this point is just your leadership and extra particular activities. At school. I think you have really good leadership already in the school newspaper in the Yearbook as well as your honor societies. I think research will be a really big thing on your profile as well. But that leaves


274
00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:19.280
Jenny Duan: up to 6 other activities that we will probably need to think about feeling over the next


275
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:21.560
Jenny Duan: 2 months. So


276
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:36.310
Jenny Duan: just like thinking about your involvements again, I just wanna just double check that. Are you involved in anything else? It doesn't have to be academic like, are you involved in like some people are involved in church activities. Some people are taking dance classes. Some people are doing art classes like.


277
00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:38.690
Jenny Duan: is there anything else that you spend time doing?


278
00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:40.390
Srinidhi R: I


279
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:56.629
Srinidhi R: I was in dance, and then I actually quit last winter. So what? What the organization where you volunteer during your I did. I did. I was a volunteer for the loud and mute. So


280
00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:02.389
Srinidhi R: that was an after school thing, and it took place mostly in the summer freshman sophomore year.


281
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:21.929
Ivylevel:  but that again that ended by sophomore year my dance classes ended last December. So and then I'm not really involved in anything else. I mean, you have some music interest as well. Right? Isn't that?


282
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:39.679
Srinidhi R: Yes, she did learn 3 different types of musical instruments, piano, guitar, and the cello, and then she has couple of certifications for the piano guild piano guild certifications, and then the British one the European one.


283
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:47.499
Srinidhi R: It. It. Those aren't recent like those were before I entered high school, which is why I didn't mention them.


284
00:55:48.720 --> 00:56:13.569
Can we consider things that we did before during middle School, for example, the musical instruments, the Guild certification, and one more certification in piano. I don't exactly remember the name, but it is very honorable mention given by European organization for piano. But those were done, I think, in seventh


285
00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:27.169
Srinidhi R: it's great. So she was learning 3 different instruments and the piano the longest, I would say, ever since she was in elementary school, and she did pretty good on that. But


286
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:55.610
Srinidhi R: the Covid kind of changed everything, and we couldn't continue with the musical instruments, and she has been learning dancing since. She was 3 or 4 up until last year. So when the Covid Dugin happened, they switched to the online classes which didn't work out in our favor. So that is when she stopped so altogether she would have learned Indian classical terms for more than 10 plus years.


287
00:56:56.230 --> 00:57:06.780
Jenny Duan: Very cool. But who dance? Is that again. It's an Indian classical dance. Oh, cool! Did you ever do your I forget the performance at the end of that.


288
00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:24.669
Srinidhi R: No, the room I haven't. No, we haven't. We haven't reached that far. It would take like another one or 2 years to reach that. But she has given lot of annual performances? Which includes some pieces which would be a part of that final ceremony.


289
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:28.030
Srinidhi R: the graduation ceremony yeah.


290
00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:32.890
Jenny Duan: would you be interested in doing or preparing for minimum kitchen, or anything like that.


291
00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:40.929
Jenny Duan: Is that, or is that too late to do? It's not too late. It's not too late. If I like, start


292
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:46.149
Srinidhi R: like right now and then, like go to classes consistently. But I should.


293
00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:57.189
Srinidhi R: if I start now and then slightly push for it. I could finish it by end of senior year. Pretty much. Yeah, we can get it done by end of senior year. Yeah, that is a possibility. Now.


294
00:57:57.350 --> 00:58:20.279
Jenny Duan: I think that's something you can consider if you if you want to do it. I think like having some connection to your culture is is another really great thing, not only just for yourself personally, but like for colleges to. They're always looking for students who, you know, can contribute to their different cultural communities. For example, like there's different cultural dance groups like, there's I know at at Stanford this like a South Asian dance group. There's


295
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:47.199
Jenny Duan: Bollywood dance groups. There's possible dance groups, and like, probably just want to want to see that, you know, you'll contribute to other aspects of the community beyond. Just you know the academic and the research side. So having some things like music or dance like interactivity with could be something really impactful. For you, just like not only from a personal standpoint, but also from like innovation standpoint, if that's something that, but that you wanna continue. But I do know that like


296
00:58:47.200 --> 00:59:03.209
Jenny Duan: doing, I know that it's a time commitment, because I have lots of friends in in high school who did that, too. So I think it is something that you can decide if you want to, personally do. But I would recommend definitely trying to pick that up again. If if you know, you feel like you can commit to it. The other thing is


297
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:18.980
Jenny Duan: I think, within music. That's also something that I think if you spent so much of your life doing that you don't have to let go of like I think there's an opportunity to maybe combine that with like your passion for disability, advocacy, or something. For example. I know, like


298
00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:34.639
Jenny Duan: so for some context, like, when I was in school as well, specifically in middle school, I used to work a lot with, like a special education classroom, so that my middle school and I would like be an aide for their classrooms and spend a lot of time with the students there, and I know that like music is one way that


299
00:59:34.640 --> 01:00:03.430
Jenny Duan: you know, helps a lot of people like regulate emotions and kind of calm down after having like being in a stressful situation. So I'm wondering if that is something that you can think about doing like a project where maybe you teach kids with special needs music. Or maybe you you do some type of like music therapy or music healing type of project. I think that's something that we can definitely work on. And brainstorm, if that's of interest to you as well.


300
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:30.129
Ivylevel: Great! II know that actually, you know the at Stanford. They have their family day to day. All their parents are visiting, so I think thanks a lot for us. I truly appreciate both of you all joining. So I wanna be respectful of your time as well. So literally, it's an update for them. But I think what I wanted to do in the next couple of minutes is again like, see? I mean this report and the plan, and the I hope you found it useful. And there's there's a lot of value that we can actually put, you know, in in the assessment and report. What we would do is actually, we would just like.


301
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:31.570
Ivylevel: you know.


302
01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:55.650
Ivylevel: take all the feedback here, and all the notes that Jenny has taken, and sit in more like a you know committee as a team, and then we'll actually draft craft something very precise for you. You know, I I'm absolutely personally like, blown away by the number of areas that you have really demonstrated so many different things. And right? And actually, I'd a when I was looking at your profile, like, you know, because you told me. Cs.


303
01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:11.989
Ivylevel: and you know, Nsa, and that's why I basically, you know, just had, like I didn't kind of joined from a data science perspective, and I'm glad that you're also a daily writer. She's a Stanford daily writer as well. There is some synergies, but then I think that 2 coaches were probably not enough, you know, because


304
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:23.509
Ivylevel: your profile is also very similar to one of our coaches. Noor, actually, who's doing a Cs and nuro kind of an interdisciplinary program at Stanford. And she's actually doing research in Adhd


305
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:35.439
Ivylevel: and other kind of neural diversity. So I'm like wondering, like how many people should have actually really brought for you. I think that's a good thing. But II also want to be like very direct here, right? It's like, because we have gone through this.


306
01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:50.320
Ivylevel: I think again, me like sitting from the outside and looking at all the students where I kind of really feel is to me. It's still like loose should be like too many things right? It's still like that disjointed kind of a profile that we need to try to converge into a voice and narrative.


307
01:01:50.350 --> 01:02:14.359
Ivylevel: and I think the the art there, and you would see like, you know, when we start this kind of and you know Jenny is already kind of you know, managing like since last year II showed you a few things like, you know, juniors right? The first thing is not to really overload you with like. And I'm wondering like, How will you find time for doing, you know, like music and birthday and everything else like it's just not possible. So I think the the art really is to


308
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:23.539
Ivylevel: number one, and that's what like is a as an example. This the scheduling that I talk about. That's so critically important. It's about prioritizing the things that you need to go after


309
01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:41.559
Ivylevel: to really build that cohesive narrative and to also start eliminating things that you should not be spending your time on. And we do this week after week, right? And and you know, Jenny can say, because I think time is your biggest asset. Now that you have to really utilize. And as Jenny rightly said, low effort, high impact.


310
01:02:41.720 --> 01:03:07.060
Ivylevel: we need to figure out the top week spots, and I can already sense what the weak spots are. Gonna be I again, I will let basically Jenny come up with, you know, extracurricular activities, because also the fact that you're going into an interdisciplinary program where you need to show humanities. And the you know, cultural side. Those things are kind of literally empty, right? Like not not to like sound bad. I think we need to cover those things, and the other like stem. You are quite strong in academics. You're kind of strong in.


311
01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:22.040
Ivylevel: but also like your research to me. I was actually, you know, taking notes, and we always try to understand the why, like the authentic why, and it's become very clear. By the way, you know, like I'm I'm disclosing. I do have Adhd myself. I'm a newer, diverse person myself.


312
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:26.019
Ivylevel: and the moment you really spoke about like you being able to do that


313
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:35.559
Ivylevel: to me, it really touched, you know, because that is the authentic connection there. And again, I'm not. I'm not saying that you have to go back to neuro research. But there are internally program.


314
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.309
Ivylevel: This is why I think


315
01:03:37.390 --> 01:04:04.909
Ivylevel: when you look at the the kind of execution program we have, and it's hard for me to explain. And that's why I'm kind of you know, raising the question here because we have experts here who are working on a week to week base basis, right with other students. So I really want to clarify that because I really don't. I don't want to miss the opportunity to work with a student like Srini, like she is very strong. She has all that it takes to get in. But I can all be. We can already see that there are these weak spots we need to really help her with.


316
01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:27.470
Ivylevel: And it requires so like, you know, just to tell you, Jenny and Eden, right? So parents like, you know, like every other kind of parent, and they know about me as well. Why I'm doing this, you know. We all come and we ask, like, you know. What else can I do in the summer? What more activities can I do? And that's the kind of request. And I told you right. You know that checklist is not the way to go about it, and you could already sense that. How the kind of the line of questioning that Jenny came up with


317
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:37.489
Ivylevel: so really crafting that 2 things right, we are working backwards. So number one, we have to sooner than later in a few weeks time. It's an identity process.


318
01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:45.829
Ivylevel: But we have to really come to some kind of a convergence to say that this is your target profile number one, the standout right? The Y.


319
01:04:45.880 --> 01:05:04.949
Ivylevel: You know. And then, based on that, we also kind of come up with the target college list and major list, you see, like, now, Jenny just off top of her head, she was able to come up with 2 or 3. But the way that our juniors are working right now is like it's an exercise, right? So Jen Jenny would come up with an initial list, but they would also to in the week. They would also work on it.


320
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:22.440
Ivylevel: They would look at things even like as small as like, you know, vegetarian food as an example. Right? Like people have left Uc. Berkeley to go to Ucla just because they could not find a good food, and the weather was gloomy. So I think you give that opportunity. But the the the this is the real thing. This is like we have gone through this cycle multiple times.


321
01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:25.900
Ivylevel: Your narrative needs to be, you know, clarified quite soon.


322
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:38.790
Ivylevel: Then your target colleges and programs need to be like, you know, kind of a baseline somewhere. What that will do is that will bring more clarity, and that will reduce unnecessary stress and noise from your scheduling.


323
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.950
Ivylevel: and she will go after that. And, for example, like Jenny, has spoken about 2 or 3 awards.


324
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:51.809
Ivylevel: we need to figure out awards where we can maximize your winning opportunity. And we are also like, and and those awards is not like, you know, just because it's a deadline


325
01:05:51.990 --> 01:06:07.889
Ivylevel: like you going and applying to it. It's all part of building a narrative. This is what I'm saying, like, you know, an application does not really start in August or September. And the reason I'm selling this is like, I want to set the context. Why parents ask me, why does it have to be like a weekly thing because they're already so burdened.


326
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:25.360
Ivylevel: But that's the point. Why, you know, as Jenni said, you don't need more academics anymore, you've already demonstrated that. Send. Why are you like? You're spending time on those extra kind of python classes and everything else. Right? You can always learn. But your time is more valuable to really fill the other aspects. Right? So I'm just trying to bridge that gap.


327
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:42.979
Ivylevel: So again. Sorry J Jenny and Erin. I'm kind of speaking on your behalf, but you know, you know, under your command as well, but because you know, my job is to really convey the message to the parents on. Why, it's important to kind of prioritize, eliminate things.


328
01:06:43.030 --> 01:07:00.760
Ivylevel: start building the target target target narrative. And what happens is the beauty. I'll tell you one thing right, because you know ma you know, Jenny, as an example like you know my daughter is is only Cs right? So she has been working for a couple of years now herself, and I can see, like the months at this stage have been very busy, because


329
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:13.740
Ivylevel: they preparing these applications for these summer programs or awards, also takes time. They are like many applications. It's not like just applying right? You have to add, additive, and you can see our coaches and every session they would be like.


330
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:21.490
Ivylevel: why are they asking this question, what's the why? Behind this question, what is relevant. What's not relevant. It takes a lot of time just to kind of craft that and win that.


331
01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.946
Ivylevel: So all I'm saying is that it does take, you know, all, all all this time to really deliver an outcome and impact. And I told you that we want to really deliver an outcome and impact.
