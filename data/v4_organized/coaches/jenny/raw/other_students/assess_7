1
00:00:16.706 --> 00:00:36.225
Jenny Duan: well, awesome. So it's really nice to meet you or Nov. My name is Jenny. I'm a current undergrad at Stanford, where I say symbolic systems, which is an interdisciplinary major that combines computer science, philosophy and psychology. And I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, so really excited to get to know you today. I'll hand it to summer.


2
00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:54.656
Summer Royal: Yeah, I'm also super excited to get to meet you. I'm summer. I'm a junior here at Stanford studying biomedical computation which combines biology and computer science. And I'm also in my first year pursuing a master's in computer science with a concentration in artificial intelligence. And I'm from Honolulu.


3
00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:57.705
Summer Royal: and I'll pass it over to Andrew.


4
00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:12.956
17048905597: Hey, Arnov, I'm currently a freshman at Stanford. I heard that you did a lot of debate, which is something I pursued a lot in high school, but now I'm looking more into the field of Cs and data science


5
00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:44.826
Jenny Duan: awesome. So how this session will work, Arnold is. I'll just be asking you a couple of questions and our conversation will help inform some of the recommendations that we, as a team, provide for you when it comes to things like structuring your activities, your programs, and really bring clarity to your, to your profile, to your interest and to where you wanna be in what you wanna achieve. So does that sound? Okay? And then at the end, we'll leave 20 min for any questions that you or your parents might have you know, regarding to college or


6
00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:47.935
your extracurriculars or your interests. Does that make sense to you?


7
00:01:48.176 --> 00:02:15.335
Jenny Duan: Awesome? Sounds good. Well, yeah, and feel free to respond to my questions just as honestly as possible. And hopefully, you can just be like a conversation to get to know each other. So I'm just really curious. I'd love to learn a little bit more about you if you want to introduce yourself. Maybe II have access to your profile, but just want to hear from your perspective, like, how's school going? So maybe where you're from, what school, what grade, and just how school is going for you in general.


8
00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:26.966
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah. I'm Arnoff. I'm a tenth grader at Montevista High School in Cupertino, California. School is like, yeah. It's going pretty well. Not too many struggles. Yeah.


9
00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:38.715
Jenny Duan: awesome. And you know, can you tell me a little bit more about your classes? I know that you mentioned. You're taking, like all Ap's possible. What classes are you in? And and how those gone for you?


10
00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:44.086
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah. I'm in ap physics. One ap calculus ab ap computer science a


11
00:02:44.156 --> 00:03:06.466
Aarnav Agrawal: regular history regular lit Spanish 2. And then I'm a ta for one of my past teachers. All this classes have been going pretty well. I have a 4 Gpa. Not really struggling in any of the classes cool. So just to clarify ap physics. One Apoc Abcsa. Regular history in English, Spanish. 2. Ta for a class.


12
00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:10.516
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, like one of my like, my teachers from last year, like, I'm a ta, right?


13
00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:14.645
Jenny Duan: Oh, is that a ta for a specific class, or just do you help the teacher in general?


14
00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:18.845
Aarnav Agrawal: For a specific class? So like it's an intern to Java class.


15
00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:23.545
Jenny Duan: Oh, super cool! And what were your classes last year?


16
00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:25.726
Aarnav Agrawal: It was


17
00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:30.065
Aarnav Agrawal: algebra, 2 trade biology orchestra


18
00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:33.426
Aarnav Agrawal: intra to Java, Spanish, one


19
00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:36.066
Aarnav Agrawal:  regular lit.


20
00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:37.376
Aarnav Agrawal: Np.


21
00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:40.676
Jenny Duan: okay, cool. What instrument do you play?


22
00:03:41.136 --> 00:03:45.416
Aarnav Agrawal: I used to play the viola, but I stopped playing. Now, why'd you? Why'd you stop?


23
00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:15.516
Jenny Duan: I mean, II stopped playing altogether. So I don't really have too much interest in the instrument anymore. Oh, okay. What what inspired you to start playing. Was it like, your parents want you learn music? Or what did you find interesting, or what kind of inspired you to play? And how long have you played for?


24
00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:25.136
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah. I started playing in middle school. So since sixth grade that was like the most appealing elective option back in sixth grade, and then I just I chose a view a lot cause like


25
00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:30.096
Aarnav Agrawal: musical sort of sound sounded nice to me. Yeah, I started playing it.


26
00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:53.526
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense. I know. I mean, come to think of it, like, what are the other middle school elective options like art or other things. Yeah, I think I would probably pick I'd probably pick orchestra to in high school. I did jazz band. So I definitely luckily, at my High School jazz band was a 0 period, so I'd have to wake up really early. But that means like that meant I could fit it into my schedule, but I think if it had just been a normal elective, I probably would have dropped it as well.


27
00:04:53.526 --> 00:05:04.395
Jenny Duan: So empathize with that and can you tell me a little bit more about like what a piece are offered at your school? You said you're taking the Max possible. And do you know what schedule your schedule is gonna look like next year?


28
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:33.615
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah. So in terms of this year like, II was going to take, I normally people after algebra to trig, which is what I took last year. I people normally take precalculus honors but I study that over the summer and then skip to ap calc this year our school doesn't have any ap like history or English classes for sophomores this year. Then, like in terms of science and whatnot. I'm taking ap classes and then for next year I'm planning to take


29
00:05:33.656 --> 00:05:39.506
Aarnav Agrawal: Ap. Physics. C. Ap, Us. History honors, American literature.


30
00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:43.746
Aarnav Agrawal: Ap. Statistics. Spanish 3.


31
00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:45.905
Yeah, and that's it.


32
00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:50.306
Jenny Duan: Cool. So are you digging Ap. Cock? Vc, next year?


33
00:05:50.646 --> 00:05:56.416
Aarnav Agrawal: No, I'm taking ap stats. I'm self studying the remaining 2 units for the Apop. Vc, exam this year.


34
00:05:56.636 --> 00:06:11.545
Jenny Duan: Oh, that sounds good. Yeah. When I was in high school, I also did that, or I didn't do Ab, but I just went to PC. I feel like you can do it in one year, especially since you seem like quite sharp. I think that's fine for physics. See at your school, is it? Enm, or mechanics, or is it both in the same year?


35
00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:15.145
Aarnav Agrawal:  I think it's


36
00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:26.075
Jenny Duan: both in the same year. Got it. So you're planning to take both the Ap. Tests like both ENM. And mechanics in spring. Yeah. Gotcha and does your school offer like ap English.


37
00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:32.056
Jenny Duan: like English language we have. We have ap literature in senior year, but not ap lang.


38
00:06:32.096 --> 00:06:40.386
Jenny Duan: Okay. Got it? That seems fine, then. So ap physics see a push honors English lit ap stats. Spanish 3. And what were the other ones?


39
00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:42.696
Jenny Duan: Or is that it.


40
00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:45.975
Aarnav Agrawal: that's it. And then maybe also teeing for a teacher again next year.


41
00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:51.206
Jenny Duan: Do you typically take 6 classes a year, or 7 or 5?


42
00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:58.426
Aarnav Agrawal: Oh, I took 7 last year and 7 this year. And so like 6 is kind of like the average


43
00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:10.995
Jenny Duan: cool. And then so tell me how that works? So 6, the average. What you took 7 like, how does that work with your schedule? Do students typically like take one outside of school? Or or how are you taking 7? If 6 is the average?


44
00:07:11.386 --> 00:07:24.346
Aarnav Agrawal: Oh, so you can you have the option taking 7 classes, Max. Some people just take a free period during that time, or maybe like do like dual enrollment or something. And so I just take 7 classes just because I have the option to and like


45
00:07:24.436 --> 00:07:28.265
Aarnav Agrawal: the classes like interested me. So I was able to fit those into my schedule


46
00:07:28.336 --> 00:07:34.655
Jenny Duan: that makes sense. And so, if you were to take 6 classes next year. Would you have a free period, or would that still be a full schedule for you?


47
00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:40.276
Aarnav Agrawal: It would still be a full schedule, like.


48
00:07:40.656 --> 00:07:47.646
Aarnav Agrawal: er hmm, yeah, yeah, like, I would still have time to do like a dual enrollment course instead of a seventh period.


49
00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:48.886
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah.


50
00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:51.796
Jenny Duan: yeah. So are you planning to do that or not?


51
00:07:52.236 --> 00:07:55.006
Aarnav Agrawal: Not sure yet. Like, possibly.


52
00:07:56.116 --> 00:08:25.175
Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. It seems like, you're, you know, doing really well, academics wise. I'm not too concerned about that. Do you do? Your school have rankings or not? Our school does not do rankings. Okay, I feel like that's healthy. I think it's honestly, really stressful for men's like mental health. When schools, you know, pit students against each other like that. So I think it's it's a good thing that they don't have rankings, but I do think that you are probably at the top of your class, so I think no worries there. I'm wondering, have you taken standardized testing yet? Or do you plan to do that soon?


53
00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:28.136
Aarnav Agrawal: I haven't yet, but I plan to do so soon. Yeah.


54
00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:30.066
Jenny Duan: Did you take the PSAT. This year?


55
00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:45.326
Aarnav Agrawal: I didn't. You didn't. Was there a reason why you'd choose not to? I just. I had a debate tournament that conflicted with the Psat and chose to do that instead, just because it doesn't count for the scholarship this year totally. Totally. And are you planning to take that sat or the act? And how? How's the prep going


56
00:08:45.446 --> 00:08:52.756
Jenny Duan: A/C sat? And I haven't like really started prepping or anything. Got, you know, when you plan to take the test?


57
00:08:53.476 --> 00:09:01.105
Aarnav Agrawal: I might try to do it like when they offered in April or May this year. Otherwise just start of next year, like in August.


58
00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:14.956
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. I think either works the good thing about taking it, you know, sooner than later is that you can prep for the sat concurrently while you prep for the Pst. Because the questions are quite similar. And honestly, at this point, like your pst is probably like.


59
00:09:14.956 --> 00:09:38.125
Jenny Duan: It's more important for you to get a good score on the Psat. Then the sat as counter-tuned to as that sounds because you only get one chance for the Ms. Qt. Which is the scholarship exam for the Pst. But if you wanted to, you could retake the sat one time, or you could take the act. So I think it's good that you know you have that in mind, and you're planning to take the sat before October when the when the Pst is offered. What are your favorite classes in school? And


60
00:09:38.406 --> 00:09:41.035
Jenny Duan: yeah, how do you are there any costs that you don't like?


61
00:09:41.646 --> 00:09:52.166
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, like, my mainly my favorite classes are Cs and math. I think those always join me. And I'm really passionate about Cs classes. I don't like.


62
00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:58.715
Aarnav Agrawal: II think I like all my classes. Yeah, there's not really a class I don't enjoy in particular.


63
00:09:58.726 --> 00:10:05.925
Jenny Duan: I'm curious, like at school. What's your relationship with your teachers like and your peers like, I guess. How do you think your teachers would describe you?


64
00:10:06.896 --> 00:10:25.876
Aarnav Agrawal:  like, my relations are fine. I don't have any negative relationships. I would like to be honest. I don't really think I would say I have any extremely positive relationships with any teachers, except for maybe my math and physics teacher as well as that one teacher that I ta with just because I don't really think I


65
00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:28.846
Aarnav Agrawal: like participate as much in class. I kind of just do my own work.


66
00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:30.186
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah.


67
00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:44.825
Jenny Duan: yeah, that makes sense. And so can you tell me a bit? I know that debate is like a really a really big passion of yours. And you're trying to qualify for tournament champions this year. Right? So I think that's super exciting. Can you tell me a bit about how you got involved in debate, and


68
00:10:45.046 --> 00:10:51.466
Jenny Duan: and what that looks like for you? What your level of involvement. Looks like, obviously, I know you're quite competitive, but love to hear it from your perspective.


69
00:10:51.906 --> 00:11:08.006
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah. I started doing debate since sixth grade like 6, 7, 8 grade. I did debate didn't do it as seriously as I do it now, and when I got into ninth grade I switched to a different style. And so like ninth grade. And now I do debate a lot more competitively.


70
00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.595
Jenny Duan: What style do you do?


71
00:11:09.756 --> 00:11:17.165
Jenny Duan: Lincoln? Douglas. Okay. Makes sense and how do you do in your like local debate? Tournaments?


72
00:11:17.836 --> 00:11:43.325
Aarnav Agrawal: I do find last year was like cause. I transitioned to a new format. It didn't go as well as I had hoped. This year. I've been consistently making it to the elimination rounds. But I haven't gotten any bids yet which are what you need to qualify for the tournament of champions. Got it? So do you have I guess if you could forecast. How how likely do you think you are to making it? And like, is that a major goal of yours?


73
00:11:43.876 --> 00:11:51.086
Aarnav Agrawal: Definitely a major goal in terms of making it this year. I, there's only like 4 tournaments left.


74
00:11:51.806 --> 00:12:09.755
Jenny Duan: Yeah, 4, 3 or 4 tournaments left so probably not gonna happen this year to be realistic. But next year, definitely, I think, are you involved in any other like styles beside Lincoln, Douglas? Or is that your primary thing, Douglas, what do you like about it?


75
00:12:10.165 --> 00:12:22.356
Aarnav Agrawal: I like like it's a one on one side off to rely on a partner. There's no like scheduling issues. I can. I like, obviously the sort of fast pace style of it, the real life skills that you get from it. Yeah.


76
00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:29.965
Jenny Duan: gotcha. And have you ever tried any other types of like speaking competitions like mock trial or ethics ball, or anything like that?


77
00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:36.275
Aarnav Agrawal: No, I haven't tried any of those I did like impromptu a couple of times in middle school, but that's like the extent of it.


78
00:12:36.296 --> 00:12:45.626
Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah. Yeah. One of my good friends at Stanford, Peter Liske, or I guess he's not one of my good friends, one of my acquaintances he won extent, I think, couple of years ago.


79
00:12:45.626 --> 00:13:07.155
Jenny Duan: And so I think there's definitely like a big space for debaters at Stanford, and at, you know all the schools that you're looking at. So that's cool and so it's really interesting that you're you know. You really like debate on one hand. But you're also really passionate about Cs. And I saw that you do use a Co. And you're quite involved in like the Cs. Clubs at school. Can you tell me a bit about what those clubs look like, and how long you've been a part of them.


80
00:13:07.616 --> 00:13:29.555
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah. So the biggest club I'm involved in is like, just my school Cs club. I was a member last year our club has 2 divisions are like the main division which covers general topics related to Cs. And then there's like the Acsl Division, which is the American Computer Science League of Contest. So last year I was a member, and this year I'm an I have an officer position in the club. I'm a secretary


81
00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:38.366
Aarnav Agrawal: and then, in terms of like my involvement, I like actively go to meetings last year I qualified for finals for the Acsl competition. And yeah.


82
00:13:39.006 --> 00:13:41.795
Jenny Duan: cool. Do you enjoy competitive programming a lot?


83
00:13:42.266 --> 00:13:53.176
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it's interesting. Yeah, cool and so you said that you're trying to clear silver this year? I guess. Is that is that a big goal of yours? And how you've been prepping for that.


84
00:13:53.546 --> 00:14:09.755
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, that's definitely a big goal of mine in terms of prepping. I haven't been able to do too much just because debate has been taking up a lot of time. I've been doing a little bit of use to go guide and doing some like practice problems but not much in terms of like classes or anything.


85
00:14:09.906 --> 00:14:20.046
Jenny Duan: Got it? And so do you. Normally, I guess, do mostly competitive programming. Do you do any other types of coding like web dev, anything like that? Or is it mostly just algorithm stuff


86
00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:22.036
Aarnav Agrawal: be mostly just competitive focusing.


87
00:14:22.106 --> 00:14:26.246
Jenny Duan: Got it? Got it makes sense. Have you tried any other


88
00:14:26.606 --> 00:14:33.176
Jenny Duan: like any other programs besides Acsl and Useico like, have you done code forces at all, or anything like that?


89
00:14:33.786 --> 00:14:42.665
Aarnav Agrawal: I've heard of code force quote code forces, tried it a couple of times. I think the contest normally happened like the mornings which don't really fit with my schedule


90
00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:53.175
Aarnav Agrawal: I did the sign up for the Congressional App Challenge. There was a couple of other friends, but we like didn't really have much time and kind of fell apart.


91
00:14:53.196 --> 00:15:16.246
Jenny Duan: Got it? Got it? Yeah, that makes sense. I know there's like a couple of other competitions on. I'm gonna write up a document with recommendations for you. So don't worry about memorizing this, because I'll put it all in document. But there's some other things like Microsoft. Imagine Cup that I think you can enter and like, there's if you really like competitive programming. I know there's a lot of opportunities in that space. So I think that's definitely a skill set you should keep because they'll definitely be useful for you later in life.


92
00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:25.286
Jenny Duan: I know that you also really like Math, and I know a lot of competitive programmers also do math competitions. Do you do any of that like, do you do the Amc every year, or anything like that.


93
00:15:25.736 --> 00:15:35.225
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, I gave the Amc. Last year gave it this year. I was this year. I was like 1.5 points from qualifying for Amy. That's the extent of like Matt.


94
00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:40.305
Jenny Duan: are you just in? Are you interested in training for that to qualify next year?


95
00:15:40.656 --> 00:15:46.786
Aarnav Agrawal: Potentially. But math isn't like competitive math isn't as big of a focus for me.


96
00:15:47.086 --> 00:15:51.845
Jenny Duan: Got it? So I guess your main focus is then our Cs and debate right?


97
00:15:52.046 --> 00:16:00.626
Jenny Duan: And then. So the other thing I saw on your on the form you filled out is that you did, cosmos? So you you got in. But did you end up doing it.


98
00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:04.346
Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, I ended up doing it. And what was your project on


99
00:16:04.716 --> 00:16:11.055
Aarnav Agrawal: our project was on the Fibonacci series and investigating different properties about the Fibonacci series.


100
00:16:11.116 --> 00:16:14.345
Jenny Duan: See? That? Seems like pretty Math related. Did you enjoy it?


101
00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:23.615
Jenny Duan: Yeah, it was. It was really fun. Are you planning to, I guess. Do more. Would you be interested in doing more math, research or research in general? Do you think?


102
00:16:24.466 --> 00:16:31.555
Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, for sure. That would definitely be interesting. What what was like was fun about doing the project.


103
00:16:32.186 --> 00:16:48.036
Aarnav Agrawal: I mean? Well, so that wasn't the only focus of the program. There was also other topics. But in terms of that, it was really fun just to sort of see how like like numbers play out. How like we sort of investigated. How like the Fibonacci series involves, is involved in like real life.


104
00:16:48.036 --> 00:17:11.766
Jenny Duan: And then, just seeing how like numbers can be manipulated and sort of like the magic of numbers. Hmm, that's super cool. Yeah. So we've gone over. You know your passion for debate. Cs math. I'm curious like beyond that. Is there anything that you're involved in, or anything that you're interested in? And this doesn't have to be school related? It could be anything like, if you like video games if you're like playing basketball, if you like, any of that, like, what are some of your other interests outside of school debate? Cs, math.


105
00:17:12.566 --> 00:17:26.616
Aarnav Agrawal: Oh, yeah, outside of school. I also do volunteering for an organization called Steel City Codes. I just provide Cs education for like elementary middle school students. So I'm a website admin for there as well as well as a chapter head.


106
00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:28.316
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah.


107
00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:30.995
Jenny Duan: Okay. And then do you do anything else beyond that.


108
00:17:31.706 --> 00:17:33.046
Aarnav Agrawal: No, that's it.


109
00:17:33.666 --> 00:17:39.916
Jenny Duan: Gotcha. So are there? Are you involved in any other clubs or leadership at your school in any way?


110
00:17:40.996 --> 00:18:02.395
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, I'm also an officer for my school's debate club. I'm one of the directors of tournament registration so you handle like collecting fees for tournaments and registering students for tournaments that's super cool. So for debate and and the Cs club do, what is the likelihood that you gain like a president or vice President role by senior year.


111
00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:04.336
Jenny Duan: If you could answer honestly.


112
00:18:04.466 --> 00:18:29.385
Aarnav Agrawal: yeah, for Cs club, pretty likely next, if not next year, like 100% senior year, just because all the current officers, except for one other person are all seniors, so they'll all be graduating. And then, most likely, like we had a conversation a couple of weeks ago. Most likely. We might be like a Co. President system next year, in which case it'd be me and the other person, and if that's not the case, and like definitely senior year and then in debate.


113
00:18:29.436 --> 00:18:37.915
Aarnav Agrawal: probably also by senior year right now, there's like a lot of juniors due to debate, and are probably gonna have preference for President


114
00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:41.776
Aarnav Agrawal: next year. But, like probably my senior year president of Debate Club.


115
00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:59.795
Jenny Duan: got it, got it? And then so we kind of go have gone over all of that. Then can you tell me a bit about what your goals are when it comes to college like, have you thought about what you're gonna study? And I know you want West Coast competitive schools right? And are you looking to study? Cs, like, what kind of schools and and majors or or fields interests you?


116
00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:11.976
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, I definitely wanna major in Cs, possibly like like like a minor in mathematics or something. And then West coast isn't necessarily like a priority, obviously would be preferred. But


117
00:19:12.016 --> 00:19:18.095
Aarnav Agrawal: other schools, and, like the East coast, etc., are still, as long as they're competitive and like top colleges is a goal.


118
00:19:18.346 --> 00:19:41.465
Jenny Duan: Okay? Cool. So right now, what I'm hearing from you is, first of all, you have a really impressive record. You're super, and you also seem like you're very kind, like it seems like, you know you're charismatic like kind. Have a lot of interest. And it seems like you have really high goals, and you're on a good path to meeting them. I think right now, something that I'm noticing in your profile or in your extracurriculars is that it seems


119
00:19:41.466 --> 00:20:04.665
Jenny Duan: very cookie cutter. If I'm going to be honest, and I'm not saying this in a bad way. I'm saying this to point it out to you early, as you know you're you're you're quite young right now, so that you have time to change that. But I think like given you know your demographics like coming from Bay Area and being interested in Cs. There's so many other students, you know, applying to the same schools as you that are interested in the same things as you, and have the same background as you.


120
00:20:04.666 --> 00:20:07.455
So I think your primary goal over the next


121
00:20:07.596 --> 00:20:31.346
Jenny Duan: couple of years should be to try to bring out the things that you're passionate about or interested in, that maybe make you stand out or make you different. Because I think, you already have quite a strong computer science background, quite a strong math background. But then, again, so many other bay area kids have the same background. So I think what we should find out, and what we should talk about, you know, in the remainder of our session today is, how can we bring out some of your other interest that might


122
00:20:31.346 --> 00:20:38.846
Jenny Duan: help you stand out in conjunction with, you know your interest in speech, in in in Cs, does that kind of make sense to you.


123
00:20:39.256 --> 00:20:54.035
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense totally. So I think, like, I'm just curious. So typically what you know strong applicants have is they have like intellectual curiosity, and this is the framework that Stanford uses to evaluate their students, intellectual curiosity,


124
00:20:54.386 --> 00:21:19.205
Jenny Duan: intellectual rigor, curiosity, and, like a passion for serving the world or social justice in some way. So I think that, like, you know, based on your interest and what we've talked about already, you seem to already be showing that, like intellectual vitality, quite well. You have good grades, you have. You're taking difficult classes. You're challenging yourself outside of school. I think. What I would like to see more is leadership in you, and also like a commitment to certain cause or


125
00:21:19.336 --> 00:21:30.315
Jenny Duan: a certain passion that's maybe different from your academic interest in like debate? Or Cs, so straight off the bat like, is there anything that you are interested in that might like


126
00:21:30.406 --> 00:21:46.645
Jenny Duan: be a cause that you would want to bring out to you more? Or is there something, you know, unique about your story or background, that you feel like you would want to highlight more because a lot of schools do look for diversity in a lot of different ways. And so like, do you think there's anything, any cause or anything about your background or your interest that might fit that.


127
00:21:46.976 --> 00:22:08.626
Aarnav Agrawal: And if not initially, he did survey some college students about their knowledge of climate change. And then I replicated that survey with around 150 students at my school.


128
00:22:08.626 --> 00:22:20.445
Aarnav Agrawal: And then we like wrote up analysis like an analysis paper about the research, the results, and, like eventually turn that into a case study which is in the process of being published in like the Berkeley case, study journal.


129
00:22:20.606 --> 00:22:24.816
Jenny Duan: and so, yeah, the climate change, I guess, could fit sort of what you're talking about.


130
00:22:25.316 --> 00:22:31.595
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So climate change is also quite broad is there something specific about climate change that you are particularly interested in?


131
00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:33.705
Aarnav Agrawal: Not really


132
00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:59.615
Jenny Duan: okay. And beyond this, is there like, are there any other interest areas that you, you know, are passionate about or even curious about for some students it's like quite a variety of things like I've talked with some people where their interest is in like brain conservation, or it's in like like nutrition and ensuring that, like all students have access to this safe foods for some people. It's like mental health for athletes, if they're an athlete themselves. But like, is there something like that? That? You're interested in


133
00:22:59.976 --> 00:23:05.445
Aarnav Agrawal: definitely. Not like an important cause kinda like he you mentioned. But I do like aviation.


134
00:23:05.536 --> 00:23:08.306
Jenny Duan: Oh, cool, cool. What sounds up to you about that.


135
00:23:08.816 --> 00:23:25.155
Aarnav Agrawal: I don't know. I just find it really fun. Like, I like kind of like playing aviation video games. I think it's cool. How interconnected the system is, how efficient it is and how like, you know, it's like big metal objects are just able to fly like 30,000 feet in the sky. Watching.


136
00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:28.635
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Kind of well, do you have a favorite plan?


137
00:23:28.976 --> 00:23:30.505
Aarnav Agrawal: The A. 3 80.


138
00:23:30.606 --> 00:23:43.156
Jenny Duan: Oh, cool. I don't know very much about planes, but last week at Stanford. Like a previous astronaut, came to speak with us, and so II got to see her. She was like a I think the first female like


139
00:23:43.356 --> 00:23:55.205
Jenny Duan: pilot to like fly to space. And so I think that was really cool. But aviation is is cool. I'm wondering like, How do you do anything related to aviation? Or is that just like a curiosity of yours?


140
00:23:55.396 --> 00:23:58.435
Aarnav Agrawal: It's just a curiosity. I don't do anything related to it.


141
00:23:58.556 --> 00:24:04.095
Jenny Duan: I think aviation's really cool, and I think, like, you know, there's a lot of opportunities, maybe, for you to like.


142
00:24:04.206 --> 00:24:24.186
Jenny Duan: I know, for when you're a little bit like older, like when you're a junior. I know there's opportunities for you to work at, NASA like NASA has high school internships. There's lots of programs that you can combine like your passion for computer science and aviation other things. So that's definitely something that I'll keep in mind. Let's see, can you tell me a little bit about like.


143
00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:27.085
Jenny Duan: Hmm, are there any other like


144
00:24:27.146 --> 00:24:37.905
Jenny Duan: social impact areas that you're curious about or interested in, or that make make you feel particularly like upset or excited, or anything like that that you really care about. If not, that's okay, too.


145
00:24:38.286 --> 00:24:40.616
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, nothing really, that I can think of


146
00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:43.505
Jenny Duan: okay, why do you do debate?


147
00:24:44.386 --> 00:24:57.585
Aarnav Agrawal: I mainly do debate just because I like the real life skills that are applicable to it. Like, speaking skills as well as all the knowledge that you get. You explore a lot of different topics that you wouldn't normally explore otherwise in school.


148
00:24:58.336 --> 00:25:00.226
Jenny Duan: Hmm, seems like your


149
00:25:00.316 --> 00:25:07.256
Jenny Duan: pretty curious what is like, what has been like one debate case that has really stuck out to you, or that you can remember


150
00:25:07.426 --> 00:25:08.866
Jenny Duan: very vividly.


151
00:25:09.036 --> 00:25:10.436
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, I guess.


152
00:25:10.456 --> 00:25:19.276
Aarnav Agrawal: In eighth grade, there is a topic about predictive policing resolve. Predictive policing is unjust. That was a pretty interesting topic.


153
00:25:19.636 --> 00:25:25.885
Jenny Duan: Are you interested in like algorithmic justice at all, or like legal policy, something anything like that?


154
00:25:26.116 --> 00:25:29.736
Aarnav Agrawal: Not really. I mean, I haven't like thought about it. That's something that stood out to me.


155
00:25:29.826 --> 00:25:52.305
Jenny Duan: Okay, got it. Cause I think there's lots of opportunities to explore that space and in like algorithmic justice and like epics and tech. I think that could be like a pretty good bridge. Between, you know, the the hard skills that you develop in cs, and also, like your public speaking skills. So that could be something. But if you're not interested in it, that's totally fine, too.


156
00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:55.966
Jenny Duan: let's see what other things


157
00:25:56.046 --> 00:26:02.195
Jenny Duan: Can you tell me a bit about like what your friends are like at school? And you know what what you like to do with your friends?


158
00:26:02.966 --> 00:26:28.266
Aarnav Agrawal: I mean, yeah. My friends, like we kind of at school, we may just like talk occasionally go biking whenever we have time, like over the weekends or over like whenever there's a break you've like gone out. Like to put their Starbucks a few times yeah, it's kinda like what I like to do with my friends are also like quite similarly motivated like you, or give them like a mix of like academic friends, and more like friends, that you hang out with.


159
00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:29.856
Jenny Duan: I don't know if you know.


160
00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:34.635
Aarnav Agrawal: I think, yeah, that's kind of like a mix. Most of them are also like academically motivated.


161
00:26:34.986 --> 00:26:44.325
Jenny Duan: Hmm! Got it? And do your friends do your friends do all the same activities as you like to bay and see us? Or are they involved in other things as well.


162
00:26:44.776 --> 00:26:52.175
Aarnav Agrawal: Some of my friends like business some of them also do. Cs don't really have many friends that do like debate just a couple.


163
00:26:52.576 --> 00:26:57.125
Jenny Duan: What is one thing that your friends know about you, but like the average person wouldn't know about you.


164
00:26:58.006 --> 00:27:27.346
Jenny Duan:  okay, cool. Yeah. So I think right now. What I'm trying to see is I'm trying to bring out part of your personal story and narrative, because I think like now that I'm you know, speaking with you. I can get a sense of who you are, but if you just put everything that you do on paper, it's really hard to get a sense of like, why, you do the things that you do and like what your motivations are. And


165
00:27:27.416 --> 00:27:46.336
Jenny Duan: and I think like, that's what we wanna bring to life here is we wanna give that like characterization to your motivations and your future goals, and like how going to. Maybe a prestigious school will help you get there to where you wanna be. And I think, like adding in more of those like community service things, or like cultural activities will help add color and context to like your life.


166
00:27:46.336 --> 00:27:59.525
Jenny Duan: So I'm curious, like in the future, you know. What do you hope? To? What type of career do you think you want to pursue? I know you're just in Cs and math and also debate. So that's like kind of a a good mix. So I'm curious, like what you want to take where you want to take that and what you see yourself doing.


167
00:28:00.146 --> 00:28:13.006
Aarnav Agrawal: I haven't really thought about it too much. But obviously some sort of career in computer science. Like, yeah, some sort of career in computer science, like artificial intelligence, is interesting, although I haven't linked that much related to it.


168
00:28:13.896 --> 00:28:21.976
Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, do you see yourself more on like the building side, or like, do you want to do research, like, what type of what work would you like to do within? CS,


169
00:28:22.566 --> 00:28:27.096
Aarnav Agrawal: probably like the building side, like building products and stuff?


170
00:28:27.556 --> 00:28:30.685
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, okay, super cool.


171
00:28:30.726 --> 00:28:50.976
Jenny Duan: So I think, like again, what I'm gonna emphasize is that there are probably hundreds of people with a similar profile to you. So we need to figure out a way to like make you stand out. And can you tell me like, what got you into coding? In the first place, was there an experience like a summer program like anything that like, got you interested in Cs, or is it just like being in this environment?


172
00:28:51.246 --> 00:28:54.466
Jenny Duan: What what about. You know, Cs stood out to you.


173
00:28:54.776 --> 00:29:04.426
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, I think it's mainly just like kind of being in this environment, especially like the Bay area. I can't really think of anything that like sparked any like passion for coding or anything.


174
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:08.396
Jenny Duan: Okay, when was the first time you wrote a line of code?


175
00:29:09.156 --> 00:29:16.446
Aarnav Agrawal:  I think around fifth grade or fourth grade, when I like my cousins taught me scratch


176
00:29:16.616 --> 00:29:24.636
Aarnav Agrawal: and then I don't remember. But I think it's just like a basic program. Just like to make the character move.


177
00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:28.035
Jenny Duan: Hmm! And I guess, like.


178
00:29:28.146 --> 00:29:35.405
Jenny Duan: how have you stuck with it since then? Like, so you wrote a line of scratch. Then what then? What happened like you kept on going. But what did you do?


179
00:29:35.896 --> 00:29:38.276
Aarnav Agrawal:  the


180
00:29:39.265 --> 00:29:48.576
Aarnav Agrawal: I like. I started. I think it's it's in fifth grade, I remember. Like exploring Java. And then in school we also learned of some python.


181
00:29:48.586 --> 00:30:00.246
Aarnav Agrawal: I didn't do much throughout Middle school. I started in eighth grade. Started doing more Java stuff again. And then in high school is when I started to use ago, Acsl stuff like that


182
00:30:00.606 --> 00:30:11.575
Jenny Duan: about it. So I think, like, if you're really strong at like writing algorithms, have you ever tried to like write an algorithm to make decisions about anything in like, outside of a competitive programming context.


183
00:30:12.146 --> 00:30:18.875
Jenny Duan: No, okay, I'm wondering. So you said that you're oh, you did like a robotics. Can you tell me about that.


184
00:30:19.126 --> 00:30:34.285
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah. In fifth grade I use I participated in wr, and then sixth grade. Fl. Li remember me and my friend. We did wr, we mean nationals in that and then that use like Lego Mindstorms.


185
00:30:34.446 --> 00:30:39.666
Jenny Duan: And are you still doing, Lego? I guess not, Legos. But are you still doing robotics. Now, at a high school level?


186
00:30:39.726 --> 00:31:07.315
Jenny Duan: No. Okay, cool. So I think that one thing that I'm thinking about if I think this is something that I would encourage you to at least explore a little bit. Is this further taking the idea of predictive policing, and you can kind of extrapolate that further to doing research on like algorithms that make decisions in like social context, like whether that's you know, predictive policing or housing allocation. Sf, had a major crisis where they wasted like about a billion dollars.


187
00:31:07.376 --> 00:31:27.645
Jenny Duan: There's by using algorithms to try to place houses people into like lower cost housing. But it was a massive failure, and actually like wasted a bunch of government resources. So I think, like and it also like didn't help the unhoused community either. So I think, like, look looking to, you look into like social algorithms and like algorithms that make decisions about our


188
00:31:27.706 --> 00:31:54.226
Jenny Duan: like public public interest technology like algorithms that make decisions about things like policing, housing, food allocation like budgeting resources, things like that. I think that could be something like an area that if you're interested in algorithms and studying that could be a really interesting like, apply use of computer science. And I think, like, if you were interested in that, there's a lot of nonprofit organizations that do work in this. In this some.


189
00:31:54.226 --> 00:32:04.776
Jenny Duan: I guess this type of work. And there's also a lot of research being conducted by like Stanford, Berkeley faculty on this type of work. Does that sound like it would be interesting to you or not, really. And you can be totally honest.


190
00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:09.175
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, that definitely sounds interesting, and something that I would like to like look into more.


191
00:32:09.186 --> 00:32:28.796
Jenny Duan: because to me, like one connection that I see and feel free to disagree with me on this, or propose something different is one thing I see within your connection and like computer science. And also debate is that like computer science gives you gives you like a tool in which you can fix problems. But like computer science in general, I think.


192
00:32:29.226 --> 00:32:45.986
Jenny Duan: I, Stanford, a lot of people approach computer science with this in this way is like computer science is not. It's not the solution itself. It's only a tool for you to solve like other things. But like computer science isn't a blanket solution for everything. And I think, like your background and debate really helps contextualize that because, like


193
00:32:46.076 --> 00:33:02.256
Jenny Duan: computer science is a tool, your voice is like the platform for you to enact change. And you can like exercise both. You know, computer science and the power of your like public speaking and your community connection to leverage change in your community in like different impact areas. Does that make sense?


194
00:33:02.616 --> 00:33:20.745
Jenny Duan: I feel like that's like a pretty good like, I don't know how much you identify with this, but I think that's like a good story line to bring out within, like your background and everything else, because I can tell from speaking about with you that you're quite empathetic, and I feel like that is something that I would like to see


195
00:33:20.836 --> 00:33:45.666
Jenny Duan: think brought out more in terms of like the activities that you do. And I think like that's a way to structure your existing extra curriculum without telling you to like cut any of them, or or to change them significantly. But I think, like with, you know, your application. Your eventual application to colleges, like one of the most important things, is learning how to present and frame yourself, because, again, like, I know, I've said this a lot of times, but like there's so many people with your similar background. But what makes you different is


196
00:33:45.686 --> 00:34:06.356
Jenny Duan: not necessarily the activities that you do, but rather your story. And why you do them? Because a lot of people don't have a why, and they only do things because it seems natural. And I think, like most of the activities that people have access to in high school are pretty much the same. Like every public high school. There's usually a speech to in debate team. There's usually an you know, whatever. So there's there's


197
00:34:06.356 --> 00:34:15.775
Jenny Duan: honestly. Not that many things that a person can really do to distinguish themselves, if, unless they go to like a very elite, whatever school, but I think those those people are just like.


198
00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:23.456
Jenny Duan: I think, for the vast majority of people. What sets people apart is like their story and their ability to voice their why. And so


199
00:34:23.596 --> 00:34:34.655
Jenny Duan: I think, like framing your background in this way with, you know, Co, computer science being the tool and your voice slash. Debate being your platform. I think that is like a good wide for you.


200
00:34:34.746 --> 00:34:59.656
Jenny Duan: And you can talk about, you know, in cause. I think in the future you'll have to write a lot of application essays, for you know, several programs awards things like that. And you can maybe talk about the the debate case that you had in eighth grade that influenced your thinking. And you could also talk about, I think, bringing up hyper local issues like this Sf, housing crisis. Like, if you're able to connect directly with your community by building a tool or by doing research that engages


201
00:34:59.656 --> 00:35:05.355
Jenny Duan: directly with the issues impacting your community. The closest, I think that will like we've


202
00:35:05.356 --> 00:35:08.025
Jenny Duan: it a compelling like narrative for you.


203
00:35:08.026 --> 00:35:18.745
Jenny Duan: I know I just talked for a long time. Does that make? Is that making sense to you and cool. So in your right up, I'll like, write this down and also give you suggestions to


204
00:35:18.886 --> 00:35:35.875
Jenny Duan: I'll give you some suggestions on how you can like reach out to these organizations like some professors you can reach out to and like how you can start moving in this direction. So right now. You have debate the math. The math club you have


205
00:35:36.686 --> 00:35:41.146
Jenny Duan: Let's see what else? Debate math Club. Are you still doing research right now.


206
00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:51.186
Aarnav Agrawal: Not right now, like I've talked to the professor about future projects, and he said he would definitely let me know. So it's not something that's ended. But there's no current project I'm working on.


207
00:35:51.366 --> 00:35:53.345
Jenny Duan: and also like there's no math club.


208
00:35:53.426 --> 00:35:58.775
Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry I'm at Cs Club. Not much debate. Cs club and


209
00:35:58.846 --> 00:36:02.775
Jenny Duan: let me see your volunteer. Are you still volunteering with still city codes?


210
00:36:02.896 --> 00:36:03.616
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah.


211
00:36:03.846 --> 00:36:23.436
Jenny Duan: Okay, so your main activities right now, our debate. Cs club still city codes and cosmos, which was in the summer. So that's like about 3 3 activities for depending on whether or not we end up putting cosmos on your eventual application like that might get caught because it's refreshment, your thing. But like on your common app.


212
00:36:23.756 --> 00:36:31.166
Jenny Duan: thinking ahead, you have space for 10 extracurriculars. So you really want to maximize, you know those 10 options, and


213
00:36:31.176 --> 00:36:36.615
Jenny Duan: to give yourself like a well rounded profile. So keeping those 3 things that means that we have


214
00:36:36.616 --> 00:37:01.326
Jenny Duan: room for like 7 more things, and the directions that I would really like to see you expand in are, I think, leadership that will make you stand out and service and community impact. So in your report, I'll give you some recommendations on how you can prioritize these aspects of you, because I think, like these are the things that you need to bring out to be able to share your unique story. And what makes you different is engaging in service, engaging in leadership and


215
00:37:01.356 --> 00:37:13.316
Jenny Duan: activities that we really reinforce here like, why, that we just talked about? So I think, are there any a other? A opportunities for you to get involved in leadership at school that you know of beyond like club officer positions.


216
00:37:14.116 --> 00:37:25.145
Aarnav Agrawal:  there's like the student council at my school.  yeah, that's kind of all I can think of. And what is the process for applying for that like.


217
00:37:25.826 --> 00:37:30.016
Aarnav Agrawal: I think you just like Submit like a video or something. And I think it's like


218
00:37:30.036 --> 00:37:33.465
Aarnav Agrawal: 200 words or something like that, like why people should vote for you.


219
00:37:33.486 --> 00:37:35.445
Aarnav Agrawal: I think that's it.


220
00:37:35.496 --> 00:37:45.516
Aarnav Agrawal: I haven't looked into it too much, just because it requires you to take a separate class which I wasn't able to do like freshman year, and this year, so I didn't like consider it at all.


221
00:37:45.626 --> 00:38:10.205
Jenny Duan: Got it honestly, I think if you have to take another class, then it might not be worth it. But let's know that that's an option. I think for the session. I'll do some more research into like specific like. Sometimes there's district wide councils that you can join, or there's like other opportunities for you to represent your your your city, or your town or your district in some way. So I'm not gonna waste too much time like researching that right now. But I'll do that after the session.


222
00:38:10.216 --> 00:38:16.735
Jenny Duan:  So, looking forward to this summer, do you have plans or programs that you're planning to apply to right now?


223
00:38:17.446 --> 00:38:35.095
Aarnav Agrawal: Yeah, I applied for this like the NASA internship thing you were saying not not the proper internship ones. Just. I'm not old enough. But there is some like aviation program. They have another one is like Mitre or Harvey passing mitre as an internship program.


224
00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:37.545
Aarnav Agrawal: I'm applying to Ssp.


225
00:38:37.656 --> 00:38:44.965
Aarnav Agrawal: and then, like the last potential option is just doing like a debate. Cam. That's not an application. You just like pay money and go


226
00:38:45.566 --> 00:38:50.976
Jenny Duan: hmm cool do you know where the debate camp would be like, which debate camp would it be?


227
00:38:51.176 --> 00:38:57.216
Aarnav Agrawal: It's either there's 2 options and thinking of either. There's one at the University of Michigan or Dartmouth.


228
00:38:57.276 --> 00:39:00.485
Jenny Duan: Dartmouth. Okay. Well, I would say,


229
00:39:01.596 --> 00:39:30.195
Jenny Duan: do not. I would recommend maybe not going to the debate camp if you can get into another program. But I think, like you can. If you that doesn't end up working out, then Debate camp might be good. I think I'll also probably give you some other recommendations for things you can look into just like on the report, too. I'll have to do some additional research, but I think like something that could be good, is working in internship in something like service related, just because right now, that's something that is, I think, quite missing from your profile. So I think it would be good to like start reinforcing that


230
00:39:30.196 --> 00:39:37.685
Jenny Duan: sort of at an early level. Are you? Are you sure you're not interested in like policy legislation or anything like that.


231
00:39:38.146 --> 00:39:58.725
Jenny Duan: That that's definitely something that could be interesting. Ii haven't thought about it, but that's could be definitely be interesting. That's something I'd be interested in exploring. Okay, cool. Because I know, like if you are interested in that, I think that that could be like a really good, I think, addition to your profile. I think, too, because I think it just gives further contextualization. But again, like that's also


232
00:39:58.816 --> 00:40:18.155
Jenny Duan: it's up to you like. Whether or not these things are interesting to you. I'm just gonna give you like, O options. And ultimately I think you can decide what you think is most valuable for your time with aviation, too, I think. Like I wonder if there's any organizations that you could do to like get involved with like aviation advocacy, or like


233
00:40:18.236 --> 00:40:22.016
Jenny Duan: learning that on a deeper level, I'm curious about


234
00:40:22.766 --> 00:40:25.665
Jenny Duan: Would your parents ever let you fly a plane?


235
00:40:26.386 --> 00:40:29.386
Aarnav Agrawal: Probably not. Probably not okay. Cool. Okay, cool.


236
00:40:29.446 --> 00:40:42.285
Jenny Duan: Cause. I know that like, oh, that's you know that that could be interesting if you would, you'd be interested in learning how to apply. This is a separate question from whether your parents would allow you to or not. 2 things. I think, like.


237
00:40:42.426 --> 00:40:43.386
Jenny Duan: okay.


238
00:40:43.726 --> 00:41:00.655
Jenny Duan: I think, prioritize your safety, and you know your parents is yes, like peace of mind. But if they would allow you to, I think like something like that could be maybe just a fun like side hobby for you to anything that really makes you different is are good things. Because, you know, we wanna just


239
00:41:01.056 --> 00:41:13.796
Jenny Duan: give like an admissions officer or counselor, or someone some idea of like, what makes you you? What makes you different from like everyone else? So anything that's like crazy or out of the box. I think those are all things that like really like


240
00:41:13.966 --> 00:41:23.715
Jenny Duan: help. People stand out, for example, like new people who do like hot air ballooning, and that was like their hobby or or, you know, really random random things like that.


241
00:41:23.876 --> 00:41:43.196
Jenny Duan: so don't be afraid to like go out of the mold, even if it's not something that your friends are doing. If there's something that's, you know, safe for you, that you really enjoy it, I'd say like, no matter how crazy it is, even if it's something different, like juggling, or I don't know horseback riding, or like competitive cup stacking, or whatever it is for you, I would say, like I would encourage you to go pursue that


242
00:41:43.196 --> 00:41:56.266
Jenny Duan: and so I think with the remaining time I wanna open it up for your questions for you and your parents. If they have any questions about you, know your high school experience planning ahead, looking at your future or anything like that.


243
00:41:56.296 --> 00:42:05.995
Jenny Duan: I think I have a pretty good sense right now of who you are as a person where you're interested in, and of course I'll provide more details in the report further on. So I'll open it up to you now.


244
00:42:07.536 --> 00:42:22.035
Ivylevel: Thank thank you, Jenny, and yeah, I'll I'll and I think I will spend time with you, Shushir, and are now after the call. If you have time, I would. I definitely spend especially with our new customers right, you know. So don't worry about that. We can discuss more. But I think now, in the interest of time.


245
00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:33.635
Ivylevel: And we have all the 3 talent here. In fact, I didn't know that you're actually applying to Ssp as well. Actually, we also had one more, you know, course, that I wanted to, because one of the things we also tried to do is really to drive the best outcomes.


246
00:42:33.646 --> 00:42:49.665
Ivylevel: you know, like, how does it sound like working with someone who's actually correct. Ssp, right? So that level of relatabilities where, like, you know? I wanted to show your your dad because your Dad had some experience with some Stanford mentors in the past, and I'm like, Oh, I'm not building a mentoring platform, a tutoring platform here and


247
00:42:49.696 --> 00:43:00.566
Ivylevel: this is where the magic happens. Right, we'll bring that level of talent and that caliber like that passion that you saw right and very committed people. And it takes time. So that's why I'm not scaling for the entire world. I cannot


248
00:43:00.686 --> 00:43:10.805
Ivylevel: now. The thing II think what I want is she should like you have. I mean, we have been chatting all throughout, like, you know, very important, because parents also have to understand where the weakness and gap is.


249
00:43:10.816 --> 00:43:22.116
Ivylevel: and I'll be very honest. We see so many students right? And you know, just in the last 2 weeks we had like 12 plus students signing up very good. This is fundamentally the problem that Jenny Highlight, that cookie cutter.


250
00:43:22.446 --> 00:43:37.675
Ivylevel: because what happens is it becomes very hard now, like because of the competitive nature kids are driven. But and I want to highlight 1 point. It's really that craziness like that interesting, you know, like, wherever we discuss, like what really


251
00:43:37.716 --> 00:43:46.866
Ivylevel: leaves an impression in an admission officer's mind like brain, like how many students like, you know, like, for example, how many students have done like a brain research, where also are like a rock band leader


252
00:43:47.136 --> 00:44:10.196
Ivylevel: like, you know, like that, that combination itself, like, Wow. And I think that interest it's in you are enough. And I think we that is why those are the things. The reason I'm highlighting here in front of my coaches as well is priceless for parents, especially the public school parents that we are addressing, and that's a huge gap. Now, Jenny is actually a product of a top private boarding school. But again, she's from that immigrant story.


253
00:44:10.196 --> 00:44:27.295
Ivylevel: You know her parents come in, and they basically spend so much of money to give her that education, you know. Same with summer as well like, you know. She has an immigrant story like, you know, with her mom from Hungary, I guess right from Hawaii. She kind of got a scholarship into one of the top kind of you know a again, a boarding and a a private school kind of a thing.


254
00:44:27.296 --> 00:44:53.685
Ivylevel: you know. Same thing like for you know. Alex has been sorry. Andrew, it's been a a journey from actually public school as an example, like no very different stories. But what is important? When I spoke, speak to this, II did an interview like 500 plus students, right? And Jenny knows me for the last 2 years we've spoken like Mit Howard Stanford. 80 students have spoken to. It always comes out that people who have got in the new the the value of this narrative.


255
00:44:53.696 --> 00:45:12.076
Ivylevel: and the narrative is not just an essay writing that happens towards the end. And and I'm I'm trying to highlight this. See, like the the. I was actually very nervous when you started talking right. What is Jenny gonna do with the smart kid? Super smart kid sitting there? I don't know what what weakness is she gonna identify? But, you know, like, the point is.


256
00:45:12.246 --> 00:45:16.056
Ivylevel: the community impact the service and the passion


257
00:45:16.276 --> 00:45:33.246
Ivylevel: that has to come out and very differently right? And this is where the big bottleneck is, because it takes time also. And you know passion. You cannot say that just because then I think Andrew and I were talking yesterday right like, where, hey? Finally, right, you know. Just join this club, that club, this community voluntary hours


258
00:45:33.636 --> 00:45:52.206
Ivylevel: tenure is so important like how deeply I have. We've been committed for so long, you know, for a particular cause. Right? So I think with that like Shishen, and I've been discussing so much, and also your mom. I want to give an opportunity to ask more specific questions to the coaches, and then I would love to spend some time with you. Thanks, thanks both. Yeah.


259
00:45:55.416 --> 00:45:59.035
Shishir: Oh, go ahead. Sorry to interrupt you.


260
00:45:59.086 --> 00:46:02.425
Shishir: No, no, I was saying. I don't know. Do you want? Do you want? Do you have any questions, or


261
00:46:02.736 --> 00:46:04.915
Aarnav Agrawal: I don't have any questions yet. You can go.


262
00:46:07.386 --> 00:46:17.546
Shishir: I think. I think, fundamentally, II understand, sort of like the challenges in in sort of the narrative. Right? II think the the question comes down to in my mind.


263
00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:22.606
Shishir: See, for example like no, if if debate is his goal


264
00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:27.076
Shishir: right? And going to Tucson's goal. then.


265
00:46:27.146 --> 00:46:31.856
Shishir: by definition attending a debate, camp becomes super important, right?


266
00:46:32.276 --> 00:46:38.026
Shishir: Because otherwise his chances of making it to that goal next year


267
00:46:38.116 --> 00:46:43.385
Shishir: would not be that high right? So debate camp would actually be play a big role in sort of


268
00:46:43.776 --> 00:46:54.235
Shishir: furthering that. That that that that mission right? So II guess that's fundamentally my question right? Because now you have to make some hard choices in terms of.


269
00:46:54.806 --> 00:47:02.145
Shishir: And and I'm just taking that as an example. But it's like really like, if I dig you, Sacco, and like even let's say, if I say, like, okay, this year.


270
00:47:02.666 --> 00:47:07.855
Shishir: like, honestly, I don't think he'll be able to pay a silver this year, right? Because he just does not have the time to


271
00:47:08.316 --> 00:47:14.476
Shishir: prepare for your sacco silver. There are 2 or 3, 2 more times left, or 3 more times left this year. Right, and


272
00:47:14.546 --> 00:47:16.236
Shishir: he he? Just


273
00:47:16.966 --> 00:47:18.935
Andrew Ai: so I can. I can answer that.


274
00:47:18.946 --> 00:47:29.406
Shishir: Yeah, yeah, I can answer that as somebody who did to be in high school, I see the table toe behind you, so I know you must be a serious outdoor. But


275
00:47:29.606 --> 00:47:59.496
Andrew Ai: I definitely think, campus something that's really important. I don't know what the situation is in terms of like coaching at your school, and like what your prep situation looks like. But if it if you go to a public school, you probably don't have that many coach right? It's a huge time commitment, and you're probably spreading yourself pretty thin, right? And I think if that's your goal, to go to to see, and I think putting in that time, does, you know, sort of bring you up the ladder in terms of like your extracurricular rating campus something that's gonna be invaluable and as well. Summer is, you know, 1213 weeks long campus.


276
00:47:59.496 --> 00:48:04.525
Andrew Ai: like a third of that time. You can do many things during that time period. And


277
00:48:04.806 --> 00:48:12.166
Andrew Ai: I definitely think going to camp is something that's valuable. All good debaters, I know have attended camp multiple times 4 years.


278
00:48:14.246 --> 00:48:24.986
Shishir: Yeah, but II guess maybe then the question of also like, in terms of prioritizing, like, let's say, debate as a goal versus your Sacco as a goal versus community service


279
00:48:25.596 --> 00:48:38.906
Shishir: like, how do you sort of plan now? II guess that's my question. Like, maybe I I'll take the extreme right, like he loves debate, so I won't pursue debate for him. But but let's assume that he doesn't make it to Poc next year. Right? And it's such a time. Sync


280
00:48:39.696 --> 00:48:45.045
Andrew Ai: no. 100% I like from a like utilitarian standpoint.


281
00:48:45.386 --> 00:48:57.496
Andrew Ai: I mean, debate has diminishing returns as you move up right? You put in 10 more hours per week, and you maybe make it one more Elim round right? Maybe not right, and especially going to a public school.


282
00:48:57.496 --> 00:49:16.715
Andrew Ai: The private schools around me. They have 5 prep. Coaches working day and night, you know, writing, cutting cards, and these kids just repeat exactly their coaches cut for them right? And I think the answer. That question ultimately does depend on what you, your student, are not wants to pursue. I think if he really loves to be which I did. I put a lot of time into debate, and


283
00:49:16.986 --> 00:49:17.976
Andrew Ai: I think


284
00:49:18.156 --> 00:49:29.056
Andrew Ai: if it's something you enjoy, it's definitely worth it. But I also agree. He needs to strategically position himself. So community service as we've sort of talked about and sort of position yourself


285
00:49:29.416 --> 00:49:39.356
Andrew Ai: as solving some sort of niche issue. So one of the issues that Jenny talked about. You can also look at climate change. I think that was an awesome thing that you sort of mentioned that we could have dug deeper into


286
00:49:39.396 --> 00:50:02.205
Andrew Ai: and position yourself half of the time into that. I think you've developed such a strong basis in terms of your skills. Right. You are good at math. You're good at Cs. You can speak well, and all these sort of great skills position yourself to be able to build out more things, build out things to help your community in a standpoint of social service, and I think, obviously spending time and debate and as well working on that, I think would be perfect.


287
00:50:02.516 --> 00:50:22.725
Andrew Ai: Putting all your time to date. Putting all your eggs in that one basket is probably not the strategic choice. If that's what you're thinking it is. It's very uncertain. Yeah, I would like to chime in here as well. Right, I think. See? And you know, I'm an ex Googler and Fisher is a Google, right? See? At the end of the day it's not very different than what we do. Our annual planning cycle, right. And Google is actually an extreme.


288
00:50:22.836 --> 00:50:45.726
Ivylevel: It is really taking that holistic. Take on where we have the return of investment. What is the strategy? That's why the narrative is very important, and it cannot. In fact, this particular session cannot be done in 1 h. To be honest, you just see the the load and the value that has been delivered. I'm not trying to brag here. This is based on the the years of feedback we have got. In fact, like PE. Parents have told me that this has to be done like about multiple sessions, because they could not.


289
00:50:45.806 --> 00:51:03.916
Ivylevel: The thing is, but we have to do some trade offs and make some tough choices here, because it I think the the narrative is very clear. At the end of the day, the goal, the outcome. You want. Whatever he does right? The outcome is still that you want him to have the top school and top programs where he can really have a huge impact.


290
00:51:03.976 --> 00:51:10.576
Ivylevel: And when it comes to, that's why working backwards is our kind of mantra. And it is critically important. We have to start there.


291
00:51:10.586 --> 00:51:17.815
Ivylevel: And when you talk about the outcome, there is whole lot that goes on on. How an interesting class is being chosen by the admission officer!


292
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:26.296
Ivylevel: What is the diversity aspect. See one of the things that we all critically miss in this is the identity element, the cultural element of you know.


293
00:51:26.296 --> 00:51:49.576
Ivylevel: there is a stereotyping element. Remember, like, we cannot deny that as an Asian male, as an Indian guy going from a public school, and we are ha struggling so much with one of the students. We are trying to move from Ucla to Stanford because you are in Bay Area already. Kind of well funded. Well, resource kind of top school you're talking about. Where is the extreme story here? What is interesting about you? So I think I want to go back. That's a fundamental question that needs to be answered.


294
00:51:49.976 --> 00:51:53.026
and that is where we have to choose like.


295
00:51:53.046 --> 00:52:07.655
Ivylevel: and it cannot be one. You can do like aptitude accomplishments, I totally agree, and I think you could do an Ssp, and you know program. And you that is, that still just proves your


296
00:52:07.696 --> 00:52:12.026
Ivylevel: aptitude right in terms of your skill set in terms of stem. But


297
00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:36.485
Ivylevel: the answer is not to give away your community and passions, which is again like, you know, you will see like which kind of is actually 70% of the outcome at the end of the day that really contributes to it. So I think what happens initially is this right? We like what? Now? That's why we have like the reason why Jenni is kind of positioned as the she is the most interdisciplinary, you know. Kind of student like, you know, coach, and she's been doing this in a very holistic way.


298
00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:50.106
Ivylevel: See, at the end of the day we all have to agree. They're looking for holistic people. They're not looking for academic kind of that is the fundamental thing. And you know this is like me, without even being a counselor and consultant that I've learned looking at all the students or succeeding


299
00:52:50.386 --> 00:53:02.386
Ivylevel: that holistic growth and development will come with the holistic narrative. Everything has to be prioritized. Then we go. And we basically pick. And that's why the execution becomes important to share. It is not about actually an outcome.


300
00:53:02.406 --> 00:53:10.216
Ivylevel: And and I know this is where parents come to me who don't understand. Oh, my student actually is a Taipei, very driven, very structured, very organized.


301
00:53:10.346 --> 00:53:13.346
Ivylevel: He doesn't need any push or anything else. It's not about that.


302
00:53:13.536 --> 00:53:23.216
Ivylevel: What is a narrative? A narrative is a continuous improvement and delivery process that happens every week. That framework needs to be applied on everything and anything they do.


303
00:53:23.336 --> 00:53:27.166
Ivylevel: if it doesn't fit into that narrative, you are deep prioritizing it.


304
00:53:27.356 --> 00:53:38.066
Ivylevel: So I think this is the magic that I see, you know where, like every like, for example, this is a framework like, for example, Jenny has been working with my daughter as an example, and I know, like Jenny as a long term. 2 years coach.


305
00:53:38.146 --> 00:53:49.476
Ivylevel: Now she brings in all these things. Do I do like Xyz? Do I spend more time in really coding Xyz. Or do I look at my other gaps where I'm literally nothing like, you know, I don't have anything to show in my community.


306
00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:58.986
Ivylevel: The prioritization happens on a regular basis. So to be honest, I think we cannot take a waterfall approach here. Okay, let's decide. Today, we are going all in into this.


307
00:53:58.996 --> 00:54:18.796
Ivylevel: I think there is a pivot that needs to go across. And I think, how do you bring about that story? And also like, when we are talking about awards and outcome right? We don't really target one because we have to go and find 5, but also like to find something. And I shared with you like Anushka's result as an example like, look at her Smithsonian award that we won is in the food research category.


308
00:54:19.036 --> 00:54:31.735
Ivylevel: Right? It aligns with her narrative because she's very passionate about food and environmental advocacy. And when I ran that thing yesterday with you know, Andrew, he basically told me that how many Cs students


309
00:54:31.736 --> 00:54:49.586
Ivylevel: with like a de depth of coding will actually be interested in environmental advocacy? Not many. I mean, you typically find, like humanities kind of students really pursuing like advocacy kind of thing. So that kind of a magical mix is where we need to prioritize. I'm we're talking. We are talking backwards, and we'll have to take that decision


310
00:54:49.816 --> 00:54:52.276
Ivylevel: sometime, because otherwise what will happen is.


311
00:54:52.286 --> 00:55:07.055
Ivylevel: it will really be a honestly speaking, no office, nothing. This is a standard playbook that every top cupertino pally, and you know now, biggest buzz word. Tell me, Jenny, what is the biggest buzz buzz word that everyone's trying to stand out, go for it.


312
00:55:07.816 --> 00:55:13.365
Ivylevel: It's trust me.


313
00:55:13.386 --> 00:55:21.236
Ivylevel: 2 programs every school person is applying. And when I talk to parents oh, because everyone is applying into it. And I'll tell you, AI, for all in Stanford, a freshman program.


314
00:55:21.286 --> 00:55:45.776
Ivylevel: It is not even meant for everyone. It is really for very underserved communities from certain backgrounds. But every parent is applying to that, and they are all coming. And we are actually even helping them. It takes time to be like, you know, I'm just trying to like highlight this in front of students, so that parents see my credibility comes from my coaches. I'm nobody, but my job is to really close this gap with the with the immigrant parents. Asian parents, especially like, you know.


315
00:55:45.776 --> 00:55:52.506
Ivylevel: who are like me, who are actually struggling. So that's what it is all about. Thanks. Someone. I know. It's top of the hour. Thanks a lot for joining


316
00:55:52.656 --> 00:56:04.626
Ivylevel: but yeah, I mean, I'm more than happy to spend more sometime, some more time. But I mean it. It is not something that can be answered in, like, you know. I think what what I would like is.


317
00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:10.445
Shishir: because now now there is limited time. And maybe, Jenny, when you send that report we'll see it right. I think, like.


318
00:56:11.606 --> 00:56:21.016
Shishir: I think Arno can be molded like he has obviously a set of interest. But I think it's okay to be prescriptive, and he can sort of follow


319
00:56:21.306 --> 00:56:22.906
Shishir: that pattern


320
00:56:22.976 --> 00:56:31.135
Shishir: like, for example, like climate change, like, actually, II know that professor at Berkeley, like, I actually collaborate with that professor at Berkeley at Google.


321
00:56:31.376 --> 00:56:37.546
Shishir: So so with him, he has done a project. And he actually even offered Arno to take his class climate change class.


322
00:56:37.576 --> 00:56:42.645
Shishir: which is normally for graduate students. So I think, like, what what I'm saying is that maybe if it's


323
00:56:42.656 --> 00:56:47.155
Shishir: climate change, or if it's the other thing, Jenny, that you were saying around


324
00:56:47.196 --> 00:56:50.245
Shishir: picking like policy, based whatever like


325
00:56:50.346 --> 00:57:08.305
Shishir: housing and other. So I think, like figuring out like where he can sort of focus and build that narrative. Iii think that's the that's the help. And then, hopefully, obviously, it aligns with his interest. So he's like, Oh, wow! My dad, asking to do this? Or why is my coach asking to do this?


326
00:57:08.726 --> 00:57:22.126
Ivylevel: But but Shishir, you know. And, by the way, Shishen is actually a has graduate himself. So I think that's why he's us, I think, slightly familiar. I would say I would still argue and debate with Ms. Masters, students, right? But based on our experience. But I think the authenticity


327
00:57:22.306 --> 00:57:35.906
Ivylevel: see? That's another thing, right? We, I think, if we try to really, and and that that's the thing that we have. And and I know that. Remember, Jenny, like one of these parents, actually came with all Cs, and it turned out actually, the student was all like law and advocate


328
00:57:35.926 --> 00:57:49.735
Ivylevel: like his old passion, like, you know. But my job, our job is like coaches like we wanna be brutally honest. Parents keep telling one. But this student is all law and advocate material. He will go, probably to Yale if you let him go into that direction as an example.


329
00:57:49.986 --> 00:57:51.246
The point is.


330
00:57:51.456 --> 00:58:14.465
Ivylevel: if you we try to. It's not about enforcing a narrative, because the authenticity comes out. You can smell it, you can sense it, and I'm sure that Aos can actually easily sense it, that oh, they are just doing it for the sake of it versus really saying that. And you know, in fact, less is more in this case, right? Because when you look at the profile, you know, when you have, like less kind of distractions where there's one unique cohesive narrative like


331
00:58:14.496 --> 00:58:43.045
Ivylevel: not to say you're not allowed to do, but that because that's part of the juggling and the rigor that you're showing that you're not like just one person that you can do. Only one thing, however, I think when it comes to narrative, you also need to. The authenticity needs to be there. That's why you see, the line of questioning that Jenny had is really understanding the personality and person. That's what essay is. And every essay that we read many. This is, we read from public school, especially all telling about what I've done telling this telling. There is no personality depth. Unfortunately.


332
00:58:43.156 --> 00:58:58.306
Ivylevel: So so I think I might. What I wanted to tell is like, really, this is a very nuanced point. I mean, you get it like, but II also want to say that it cannot be a static template that can be thrown at like, you know. It takes time. It evolves. It's a roadmap that has to evolve.


333
00:58:58.326 --> 00:59:13.366
Ivylevel: And that is why, for me, like personally, even like, you know, we're literally like, Stop. It is, this is actually one of our hook services. It's a goal service, it. It's just a platform we can just build out of game planning, because that's a huge gap. Today. However, we know that we cannot drive any transformation and impact.


334
00:59:14.056 --> 00:59:15.476
Ivylevel: So yeah.


335
00:59:15.876 --> 00:59:42.475
Ivylevel: thanks, thanks a lot. I'm really sorry. And I'm I'm happy to get more feedback from you as well, and you know 1510, for goodness, thanks a lot. I know that. You know students are in very rigorous schedules, and I appreciate you joining both, you know, summer and Andrew and Jenni and we we do take a week, and you know we'll start and we'll send it to you.


336
00:59:43.166 --> 01:00:12.066
Summer Royal: Happy to discuss that later, too. Just a brief overview. I actually ended up quitting Lincoln Douglas, for this exact reason, because I felt it was a time sync and it conflicted assignment, which was another time sync. But I do have pretty strong opinions on this exact topic, and I would be happy to discuss that later. Yeah. So I'm going to head out now. But I would be happy to revisit this topic at a later time. It was so nice to meet you. Bye, everyone


337
01:00:12.116 --> 01:00:13.786
Aarnav Agrawal: thanks thanks so much.


338
01:00:13.886 --> 01:00:25.596
Ivylevel: Yeah, so definitely right. I think there are so many diverse expertise. And here and that's why it's a team work, you know, and that's why always post on Linkedin as well. It might be able to bring an entire army behind every student who joins me.


339
01:00:25.636 --> 01:00:38.846
Ivylevel: Even though we need to have, like, you know, one kind of head coach, right? Because it's important, but based on our need. We want to like, for example, like you know, Alan could not join, but he actually has gotten into all the Ssp. And all that, you know. Kind of programs


340
01:00:39.116 --> 01:01:05.335
Ivylevel: but I think as a next step, I would love to get your feedback and then see like, how can we take it forward? Right? Because I mean, honestly, like, you know, giving delivering a report is not the goal. I mean, we'll give it to you. I mean, you can take it. But I also want. This is a good moment, because you have kind of fresh. And I, more importantly, what is important is enough. That is, that is eventually the most important thing. I think parents is one thing for me to really have their buy-in, but I really want to get that feedback from you are now as to like.


341
01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:18.726
Ivylevel: what have you taken away from this session? As to what you're you're a super smart kid. But what do you genuinely believe are some of the areas where you feel like you need to spend more time, and that you need more guidance, and we will. Let's let's work on that.


342
01:01:18.756 --> 01:01:38.525
Ivylevel: Because if you're already like winning all these things, I don't think there's anything drastically different that we can do for you right? Because you're already a kind of a winning ladder. And you're already a very competitive student. There are certain students who need that help, and we definitely help them. But I would love to really cover these 2 big gaps. You know that we'll see potentially, you know more clearly described by by Jenny.


343
01:01:38.716 --> 01:01:55.296
Ivylevel: So and and anyway, so yeah, thanks. I mean, I know Jenny and and Andrew, please feel free to drop. You know I just cause. I know you guys are very hard, hard. Stop here. So any closing, remarks, Jenny, before you leave and and be I mean, I'll be more than happy to discuss some more time with parents. And yeah.


344
01:01:55.326 --> 01:02:25.106
Jenny Duan: no. Ii just think. I think you're super. You have a super impressive profile. I think it's just contextualizing, and that and bringing it into because I think you know, on paper, it's hard to tell this level of like empathy curiosity that you have, and I think just bringing that out. More will be what is ultimately impactful for you. But yes, very nice to meet you and feel free to you know. Send me any questions, and I'm happy to write. Answer any, follow up questions you have, and write them in the report as well. So yeah, take care and have a great evening.


345
01:02:25.256 --> 01:02:45.395
Ivylevel: Thanks, thanks, Jenny. And yeah. And I think, Andrew, the reason I brought in Andrew was really because of public speaking, aspect so initially. Initially, I had in mind was really Alan because of the kind of debt, and in fact, I did not even know Ssp, but I know that Alan had actually gotten into. You know, cosmos, I mean, you know.


346
01:02:45.456 --> 01:02:55.025
Ivylevel: I mean you both, I mean, like, you know, Andrew and Alan, they all know each other like, you know, we are kind of a very close team as well, but I think that's why I want to be. Also.


347
01:02:55.036 --> 01:03:12.705
Ivylevel: I think first thing is like, I don't give this option to many parents. I think number one like we don't come up like 4 people, because also, like every coach, has their own style, and everyone knows pretty much their own game plan. But I think with because with sishr like for me, it was also about, like, you know, showcasing like he's a product ahead. And


348
01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:26.826
Ivylevel: we are all like Googlers, and then he challenged me on many things which are very valuable to me, because he also had a bad experience in the past. So I wanted to really demonstrate, like, you know, how we are approaching this problem? That we are. The only reason I have students is because they have the best kind of


349
01:03:27.076 --> 01:03:46.635
Ivylevel: hands-on experience. They are able to tactically help students progress. And they're delivering outcomes. It is not very about strategy. It's about getting shit done, and I think this is where I I'm going to them. Otherwise, you know, for me very easy to go and really find some counselor out there, because, there are challenges, you know, working with students as well because of their timing and all that. But we try to optimize for that.


350
01:03:46.726 --> 01:03:52.036
Ivylevel: So yeah, I think we'll discuss, and I would love to. But I think really


351
01:03:52.106 --> 01:04:13.305
Ivylevel: So I think summer you know, can I mean, let's figure out the goals based on the game plan I have given, I mean I and I told she should as well. We only have like one to 3 ratio maximum right coaches, because these are long programs. And Jenny is already like full right? She's been, I think, and also she like specializes in a few type of profiles and personas. Very well.


352
01:04:13.306 --> 01:04:29.716
Ivylevel: and and I think summer has like already started with Soham, and she has one more so. She has one limit remaining, I think, with you know, you know I'm I'm actually there's one spot remaining now with Andrew as well. And I'm just trying. I think we have to figure out like, you know. In fact.


353
01:04:29.956 --> 01:04:43.686
Ivylevel: Now, actually, Neelima wants her son also to work right? So of 8 graders, this is a new development that happened. So I'm actually, I've been talking to her as well. I want to just see how can we better align? I mean, there are other coaches as well, but I thought especially for Arnap


354
01:04:43.696 --> 01:04:49.826
Ivylevel: because of the Csn element, because I do have lot of non Cs coaches as well. Right. That's why you brought the best match


355
01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:54.745
Ivylevel: capability. And I would love to discuss with you as well to how. How can we get started fast on this. Yeah.


356
01:04:55.356 --> 01:04:56.266
Shishir: sounds good. Yeah.


357
01:04:56.776 --> 01:05:01.185
Ivylevel: cool. Thanks, Andrew. I'll I'll be in touch. And and tomorrow team meeting at 90'clock. See you there?


358
01:05:01.706 --> 01:05:04.856
Shishir: Thank you, Andrew.


359
01:05:07.856 --> 01:05:09.765
Ivylevel: Yeah. So,


360
01:05:10.986 --> 01:05:27.076
Ivylevel: yeah. So AR, I mean, is that, okay, I can ask a few questions to Arno, if it does, okay? So yeah, you can be bluntly on. Because, Arno, you're a smart guy. Okay? Like I. You know, I was blown away. Ask your dad. What did I say? Instantly a super smart guy, right?


361
01:05:27.086 --> 01:05:47.426
Ivylevel:  And and I would say that even among smart guys, you're smart, right? So it's like, there are many smart people. But then to say that. Okay, he's also super smart. There's a reason behind it because there are certain skills that are critically important. You're you're a good speaker, I think. You're very articulate in in the way you speak. You're very concise. You're sharp.


362
01:05:47.426 --> 01:06:10.726
Ivylevel: and you're also depth in academics is very evident. Right? So a person like any professor talking to you and a researcher talking to you. Any academician talking to subject matter, expert talking to you gets it across. However, I'll be like my take, because I see so many students, a different coaches is clearly there is more to your personality. There is really a lot more to your personality, and we have not even scratched the surface yet.


363
01:06:10.926 --> 01:06:18.586
Ivylevel: Right? And and that is UN, you know. Actually, that is a game changer when you really get, and I'll be honest. That


364
01:06:18.586 --> 01:06:41.176
Ivylevel: sometimes, you know, students do not like, you know, or kids do not even open up in front of parents. Not that you're you want to hide it. It's just like you think that it's not relevant, right? But I think when you start working this kind of one on one, you know, with people like your your relatable age and their kind of thing, you open up and they pick on it, and they kind of working backwards. They know what's gonna make a difference. So remember, they also know all these Admins that are working with them.


365
01:06:41.216 --> 01:06:48.436
Ivylevel: Right? So they're like, oh, they know what kind of profile, what kind of class interesting class they are in, so they always have that framework.


366
01:06:48.616 --> 01:07:07.845
Ivylevel: Oh, now! But you know, how is he interesting? What makes him interesting? You see, that's why the things that appear to be kind of trivial in like from a kind of an Indian parent mindset. I can tell you that initially, I used to look at it like you know. Why is she asking like, are you interested in flights and air like, what? How is that even? But that is what actually change changes again.


367
01:07:08.056 --> 01:07:26.276
Ivylevel: Right? That is where the magic happens on how you weave. And that's why defining a passion project takes a lot of time. Because imagine if because I have no doubt at all, and I'll tell you like, we have, like 4 5 students all see us pursuing all our doing passion projects. Correct. That's what everyone does.


368
01:07:26.816 --> 01:07:30.605
Ivylevel: They are good developers. They are good coders and all that stuff


369
01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:31.776
Ivylevel: mark


370
01:07:31.946 --> 01:07:40.215
Ivylevel: like, especially everyone wants to do AI machine learning. Now, as as as as the trend goes. Now, everyone's developing an AI machine learning tool.


371
01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:45.355
Ivylevel: I mean, let alone passion project. The whole industry is developing that. How do you stand out?


372
01:07:45.606 --> 01:08:04.246
Ivylevel: That is where your personality and how the use case and the way you're framing your passion project. How are you going to deliver that impact to that community and the cause that you're talking about? Everything needs to be woven in. And how does that happen? It happens over a period of brainstorming and discussion. It cannot happen like just like that.


373
01:08:04.316 --> 01:08:13.935
Ivylevel: So I'm just giving you one example, the I'm talking about the big rock items in your dad's language, right? Google language, right? These are big rock items that are big impact. Your passion project


374
01:08:14.036 --> 01:08:15.565
Ivylevel: that helps you stand out.


375
01:08:15.636 --> 01:08:24.485
Ivylevel: then all these credentials we we need to keep doing. But also we need to figure out something that uniquely aligns to. With your patient project definition.


376
01:08:24.706 --> 01:08:31.195
Ivylevel: So we'll figure out one of the National Awards international like sometimes it's really international awards. We're not even talking about national awards.


377
01:08:31.346 --> 01:08:42.375
Ivylevel: and they are actually much easier to win if you compare, because a lot of people are not aware of it. You know the biggest gap that II saw Shisher is that especially when you're coming to private school and boarding schools.


378
01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:54.265
Ivylevel: these kids actually have back of their mind a list of awards and credentials that we could not. We have not even heard of in our public schools. That is, the gate kept secret. I'm talking about


379
01:08:54.376 --> 01:08:57.865
Ivylevel: because our parents just go like we go to Google, and we search.


380
01:08:58.266 --> 01:09:06.265
Ivylevel: But their counselors, all their rich schools. What they've done is they have certain things which is not openly shared. And it's international events.


381
01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:35.786
Ivylevel: And when you look at it they are able to really beat that story, trying to really optimize his success chances, finding areas where he doesn't have to compete a lot. He stands out and might be right. So I think all I'm telling you is this is a game. That is how it's played. So we have to really try to fill those gaps. Okay, now, sorry up. So so tell me now, honestly, how do you feel about it, you can be very specific, because you are a very good, concise talker. Unlike me something I wish I could actually buy from you. I cannot.


382
01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:44.265
Ivylevel: Tell me what are the things that you feel like? You need help? What are the things you think you don't need? Help be be be open about it. Yeah.


383
01:09:44.776 --> 01:10:07.126
Aarnav Agrawal: yeah. Tha definitely makes sense. Like, I think the biggest thing I took away from this is like the whole cookie cutter thing about like my profile, be very similar to other people's. And definitely. One thing I would like for the the biggest thing I want to help on is just making sure that my profile does stand out compared to other people doing things that are unique, that align with my interest as well. But still make me stand out like nationally and just kind of internationally, as you're saying.


384
01:10:08.736 --> 01:10:20.406
Ivylevel: So, yeah. and and definitely, I think a game plan will obviously, like, you know, give you so much confidence, and you will see the specificity. I've shown your dad a few of the game plans, and we are executing upon it


385
01:10:20.586 --> 01:10:35.255
Ivylevel: like I showed him like, you know, it's a game plan we drafted 2 years ago, one and a half plus years ago, and now we are executing, and we are deliberate. So you know it's not like it never gets over, and I will tell you like executionally where the heavy lifting happens. I've I've seen that as well.


386
01:10:35.826 --> 01:10:46.476
Ivylevel: Executionally. The beauty is once your narrative. Why, it is really why you have to be very clear on the narrative at least, and the and I'm not saying that it has to happen right now.


387
01:10:46.816 --> 01:11:03.226
Ivylevel: right? Because I think the the beauty about you is this, and we just on board another another sophomore yesterday. There are still sophomores who have been winning a lot of things, but they don't have a converse profile. They are into everything they are doing, biomed and Cs, and they are brilliant in both.


388
01:11:03.636 --> 01:11:20.916
Ivylevel: The problem is with that your stress levels and you're gonna explode. And like, I'm I'm just saying like, this is exactly want to avoid. The good thing with you is, your depth is very clear. You are a Cs person. You are a mathematics person, and you've got basically all the credentials to back. And you will. You don't need any help on that. To be honest.


389
01:11:20.946 --> 01:11:24.855
Ivylevel: I don't want to even offer any help to you on that you can go and win on your own.


390
01:11:25.106 --> 01:11:41.705
Ivylevel: What we want to do is, however, now identify your community impact in one session, probably a bit more deep. Right? You know, like you have 3 perspectives might be like Jenny, like or we can bring in anyone, or whoever starts, they will all go deep, and they will bring out one thing that you are authentically and genuinely passionate about.


391
01:11:42.186 --> 01:11:55.535
Ivylevel: Once we bring that out, that passion and the cause that really excites you. Every student, every student has a cause. and we don't even know until we start talking, and then it is the causes actually come from your life stories.


392
01:11:55.666 --> 01:12:07.635
Ivylevel: you know. That is the beauty when you start reminding might be you had an Indian visit might be. You saw your parent doing something, and this is the kind of questioning they ask. They try to take you back and see like something that clicked you, that you still remember.


393
01:12:07.666 --> 01:12:09.505
Ivylevel: we try to bring that cause.


394
01:12:09.706 --> 01:12:21.366
Ivylevel: and once you attach that cause, your narrative is in place now every topic and everything you do, every statement, everything you do is a statement towards that that confirms that narrative.


395
01:12:21.666 --> 01:12:30.736
Ivylevel: We start putting that in place. I'll tell you now where the execution heavy heaviness is. So imagine you have like 4 awards, and you have 5 summer programs that we have identified.


396
01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.106
Ivylevel: Now


397
01:12:32.216 --> 01:12:44.096
Ivylevel: to get into those. I mean, you have got into cosmos. You know how it is. But the more you start thinking about the bigger kind of leadership programs. See, leadership is critically important, and it is not it it? Leadership doesn't mean club titles.


398
01:12:44.186 --> 01:12:44.378
Ivylevel: This is again the problem. I'll tell you again, like I was talking again to a parent. Today. Every parent, every student has a nonprofit in this Peninsula schools and lot of students are doing coaching and teaching
