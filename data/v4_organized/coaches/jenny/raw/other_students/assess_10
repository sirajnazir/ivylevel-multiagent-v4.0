14
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:53.589
Siraj Nazir: Oh, no, I think I just greeted her again, welcoming her. And I I don't know if you had a chat with your mom. I think you probably are probably familiar with the format. It's really.

15
00:04:53.987 --> 00:05:07.389
Siraj Nazir: you know, for Jenny to get to know you so feel free to talk about your your passions, or any interest you have. You know there is. There is no kind of judgment here, like you know as to what you're doing or what what's correct and what's not correct.

16
00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:17.189
Siraj Nazir: So it's a very open discussion. And it's really a conversation between you and Jenny. So I'm just gonna go turn off my camera and and just gonna listen in good luck to both of you.

17
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:40.840
Jenny Duan: Amazing. So I thought I would just start with a brief introduction, and then I will explain to you, like the format of today's structure, and then we can just get started also at any point, feel free to interrupt me like Sarah said, this is like a super casual conversation, so like. Don't feel afraid of like sharing anything that you want. It's like, totally no judgment here to support you in every single way.

21
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:26.325

Jenny Duan: What'd you take in 6th grade?

90
00:12:41.448 --> 00:12:50.609
Zainab Ahmed: In 6th grade. I actually I was in a middle school for about a quarter of the year. And in that

91
00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.093
Zainab Ahmed: middle school. I took

92
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:58.049
Zainab Ahmed: the elective art and all normal classes.

93
00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:59.530
Jenny Duan: Oh!

94
00:12:59.977 --> 00:13:09.960
Zainab Ahmed: But then we moved, and then the area we were in. They had an elementary school which had 6th grade, so I just had one teacher there who taught all the subjects with no elective.

95
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.400
Jenny Duan: Got it. And so what are you forecasted for for next year?

96
00:13:15.224 --> 00:13:17.405
Zainab Ahmed: I'm planning to take

97
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.590
Zainab Ahmed: earn

98
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.549
Zainab Ahmed: normal everything, and then my elective Spanish one

99
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.740
Zainab Ahmed: and Spanish one art and journalism.

100
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.419
Jenny Duan: Got it. Why, journalism that's super cool. Are you interested in that?

101
00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:36.810
Zainab Ahmed: I'd say, like.

102
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:45.199
Zainab Ahmed: yeah, I was kind of interested in it, because there was like, some options which I didn't really want to do. And like we were left with journalism.

103
00:13:45.663 --> 00:13:49.779
Zainab Ahmed: But yeah, I kind of really wanted to try journalism out, too.

104
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.030
Jenny Duan: Yeah, what interests you about journalism?

105
00:13:53.963 --> 00:14:02.446
Zainab Ahmed: It's like, when you like, write about things I feel like writing about like whatever your feelings or something else.

106
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:05.889
Zainab Ahmed: It would be like a fun experience to do.

107
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:26.019
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think journalism is kind of like art where it's like all about storytelling either way, like, regardless of what you're doing. It's like you're telling a story either about like yourself or someone else, like the person that you're writing your story about, which is like pretty cool. Have you done any journalism or reporting in the past, like either for your city or for anything similar.

108
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:26.773
Zainab Ahmed: Oh no!

109
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:35.949
Jenny Duan: Okay, and do you like read journalism like, do you read the news often like, what is your previous exposure to journalism? What does that look like.

110
00:14:36.907 --> 00:14:42.750
Zainab Ahmed: I don't really read the news, and I don't have much experience in journalism. I just wanna try to.

111
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:52.619
Jenny Duan: We're gonna try it out cool. And so have you taken any other standardized testing at school like, do you have any background in like anything else that you want to share.

112
00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:59.169
Zainab Ahmed: There was like the California State testing, which is, they do at the end of the year.

113
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.389
Zainab Ahmed: and it was for language, arts and math?

114
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.399
Zainab Ahmed: And how do like.

115
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.130
Jenny Duan: So for you.

116
00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:07.790
Zainab Ahmed: I don't think.

117
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.999
Zainab Ahmed: Did you do.

118
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.949
Jenny Duan: Guys get the scores back or do not.

119
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:19.429
Zainab Ahmed: I don't think we got the scores back. I think they give it at the start of the next year. So we're gonna get them like in August.

120
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.180
Jenny Duan: Gotcha gotcha that makes sense.

121
00:15:21.562 --> 00:15:27.300
Zainab Ahmed: I think according to that. She she got into the great double math.

122
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:34.669
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. That's assigning you for math. Right? Is that the only subject that they assign you for? Do they assign you for other subjects as well.

123
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:40.120
Zainab Ahmed: Only for math. Everything else is your regular. There is nothing else they offer, no, no extra.

124
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.819
Jenny Duan: Got it. Do you have a favorite subject.

125
00:15:44.395 --> 00:15:46.630
Zainab Ahmed: I like science.

126
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.429
Jenny Duan: Is there a reason why science is your favorite.

127
00:15:50.645 --> 00:15:58.084
Zainab Ahmed: I think it's mostly because I'm aiming to become a doctor, and that mostly

128
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.469
Zainab Ahmed: goes in the field of science, and

129
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.519
Zainab Ahmed: also, because, like

130
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:11.250
Zainab Ahmed: whenever like, we learn about new things, always interests me about how much there is to signs.

131
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.300
Zainab Ahmed: Well.

132
00:16:12.613 --> 00:16:19.510
Jenny Duan: Is there like a type of science that you like best biology, chemistry, physics? Or is science in your school all integrated.

133
00:16:20.467 --> 00:16:24.930
Zainab Ahmed: I think I would like biology the most.

134
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.180
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah.

135
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.169
Jenny Duan: Taken a biology class? Or is it one unit along like a greater section of classes?

136
00:16:31.974 --> 00:16:33.180
Zainab Ahmed: it's all integrated.

137
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.150
Jenny Duan: Got it. Can you tell me why you wanna be a doctor? Why, you're looking to be a doctor.

138
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.960
Zainab Ahmed: So like the medical field. Always

139
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:48.366
Zainab Ahmed: like inspired me, because, like you would help other people

140
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:57.969
Zainab Ahmed: like when they're in need of help. And it's just like, kind of like, a really nice job. And it's like a successful job. And like.

141
00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.369
Zainab Ahmed: yeah, it's like

142
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.330
Zainab Ahmed: good things in all one.

143
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:11.220
Jenny Duan: Those are all really good reasons to become a doctor. Is there like one moment that made you realize you wanted to be a doctor, or have you maybe always wanted to be a doctor?

144
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:16.664
Zainab Ahmed: I've always really wanted to be a doctor since I was younger. I would always say like, I wanna be a doctor when I grow up.

145
00:17:16.889 --> 00:17:18.869
Zainab Ahmed: But yeah.

146
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:24.579
Zainab Ahmed: like, while I'm going through the grade levels, I've kind of decided like, yeah, I want to be a doctor.

147
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.810
Jenny Duan: Hmm! That's cool.

148
00:17:28.989 --> 00:17:29.609
Jenny Duan: And

149
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.260
Jenny Duan: I guess, like, what type of doctor do you want to be? Have you thought about that at all?

150
00:17:34.484 --> 00:17:43.495
Zainab Ahmed: I think I might be. I'm not sure like I'm not set on one but maybe a dermatologist.

151
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.250
Jenny Duan: Yeah, why, why, dermatologist?

152
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.429
Zainab Ahmed: Because, like

153
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:54.150
Zainab Ahmed: it would be like kind of interesting learning about all skin types like

154
00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:59.950
Zainab Ahmed: why, how things affect them, and like just to help other people with skin problems.

155
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.060
Jenny Duan: Got it?

156
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.690
Jenny Duan: And beyond being a doctor, have you considered any other jobs.

157
00:18:07.828 --> 00:18:16.049
Zainab Ahmed: Not really cause I feel like engineering and those kind of jobs they don't kinda like interest me as much as the doctor does.

158
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.630
Zainab Ahmed: It's like Apana only stayed on being a doctor.

159
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.490
Jenny Duan: Got it? And then do you have a least favorite subject at school?

160
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.230
Zainab Ahmed: pogba math.

161
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.810
Jenny Duan: Math? Why is that.

162
00:18:32.035 --> 00:18:35.390
Zainab Ahmed: Because, like, I'm not really the best at it. And like

163
00:18:36.075 --> 00:18:39.409
Zainab Ahmed: sometimes it's challenging for me.

164
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.819
Jenny Duan: Yeah, what is challenging about that? What is challenging about math.

165
00:18:45.445 --> 00:18:46.490
Zainab Ahmed: Like

166
00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:53.346
Zainab Ahmed: when sometimes when the teacher, someone's explaining it to me, I don't always get it so like

167
00:18:54.186 --> 00:18:59.449
Zainab Ahmed: maybe like the concept of it isn't clear. It's like I kinda get confused.

168
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.919
Jenny Duan: Gotcha that makes sense to me.

169
00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:08.459
Jenny Duan: What math classes have you taken and like? How have they? How have they been.

170
00:19:09.825 --> 00:19:16.734
Zainab Ahmed: I've just taken normal math classes. Grade level. So basically,

171
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:24.900
Zainab Ahmed: yeah, just throughout the years, this grade level math. And I've also been getting tutoring. Now we just started it.

172
00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:27.740
Zainab Ahmed: So like, that's helped me a bit.

173
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.640
Zainab Ahmed: And yeah.

174
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.405
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think that.

175
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.810
Jenny Duan: I I know that in your profile you mentioned that, like math is an area that is a struggle, especially with the grades.

176
00:19:39.102 --> 00:19:57.740
Jenny Duan: I'm just curious like, what have your grades looked like in middle school again. This is like pretty inconsequential. This is no impact on your college admissions or anything like. So there's nothing like there's no issues. I'm just curious. I know there's like one b 1 c. What else are your grades like? And do you know what classes you got the Bnc. In.

177
00:19:58.949 --> 00:20:03.019
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah. So in 7th grade I had a C in math.

178
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.390
Jenny Duan: Once for both semesters.

179
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.530
Zainab Ahmed: for

180
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.159
Zainab Ahmed: I think in the 1st there were 3 semesters.

181
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:13.720
Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah.

182
00:20:14.121 --> 00:20:26.160
Zainab Ahmed: I joined in the second semester because I was in another school for some of the time, and then so for the second semester of that. My grade was.

183
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.530
Zainab Ahmed: I think.

184
00:20:28.196 --> 00:20:29.510
Zainab Ahmed: a B,

185
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.239
Zainab Ahmed: and then for the 3rd trimester it was a C.

186
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.805
Jenny Duan: Okay,

187
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.600
Jenny Duan: let me write this down. Do you think that this is

188
00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:53.400
Jenny Duan: because you didn't have the foundation because you switch schools? Or was it because there's something specific about the classes or tests that were really challenging or like, how have you done in math in your previous school? And how does this school compare?

189
00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:01.600
Zainab Ahmed: I think it was the foundation. And because in my previous school I did have an a in math.

190
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:08.265
Zainab Ahmed: But like when we switch schools. I think either is kind of harder or something happened.

191
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.179
Zainab Ahmed: it went like my math grade went down.

192
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:22.649
Jenny Duan: Gotcha do you feel like you're more cut up now, or is math like an ongoing area of concern for you? How do you feel about it now, now that, like the school year is over.

193
00:21:23.719 --> 00:21:34.210
Zainab Ahmed: I feel like it's I'm pretty caught up now because I do have a tutor, and she's helped me improve a lot, so like I do feel

194
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.710
Zainab Ahmed: that light

195
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.409
Zainab Ahmed: like I'm pretty caught up with everything, and

196
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.520
Zainab Ahmed: amia

197
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:42.830
Zainab Ahmed: no, and.

198
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.159
Jenny Duan: How do you? Oh, go ahead! Sorry, I interrupted. You.

199
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.049
Zainab Ahmed: Oh, my mom was just saying, I'm also doing the courses in Khan Academy.

200
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.159
Jenny Duan: What do you, you and your tutor work on? Specifically.

201
00:21:53.977 --> 00:22:06.190
Zainab Ahmed: We do. She gives me some problems from sources she finds. And we also, right now, what we're doing is we're working on courses, and Khan Academy, and I excel.

202
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.849
Jenny Duan: Cool, and how often do you meet with her.

203
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.110
Zainab Ahmed: Every day except

204
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.840
Zainab Ahmed: Saturday and Sunday.

205
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:25.719
Jenny Duan: Well, so it's like you get a break today, which is nice. But like, then you have to hop on this call with me. So it's like, maybe you're not actually in a break, but just a break from math, which isn't too bad.

206
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:35.649
Jenny Duan: okay, cool. So, classes all sound good. Do you have any nervousness about being an 8th grader, and like transitioning to call not college to high school.

207
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.370
Zainab Ahmed: Well, like not really like. I think

208
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:54.470
Zainab Ahmed: I'm just not nervous about like academics or anything but about 8th grade. I think it's fine like I'm not too nervous about it.

209
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:01.289
Jenny Duan: That's good. And how are your friends and your relationships with your teachers at school?

210
00:23:02.444 --> 00:23:10.940
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, I have a lot of good friends and my teachers. They're also really nice to me, and they help me with a lot of things.

211
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.430
Zainab Ahmed: And yeah, I have some personal favorites. I have some

212
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:15.760
Zainab Ahmed: glad I don't.

213
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.689
Jenny Duan: What are your favorites, and what are your like? Least favorite teachers?

214
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:36.679
Zainab Ahmed: Personally, I liked my math teacher because she was really nice, and she helped me a lot like and yeah, she was really nice. My science teacher was also really nice. So those are my 2 favorites. The others are like kind of normal, like, they were good teachers.

215
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:45.829
Zainab Ahmed: And my robotics teachers and my multimedia teacher, both my teacher. They're kind of

216
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.870
Zainab Ahmed: like, strict. And like, yeah.

217
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.419
Zainab Ahmed: I didn't really have a

218
00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:00.110
Zainab Ahmed: good relationship as I did with my math and my science teacher. With them.

219
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.649
Jenny Duan: That makes sense to me.

220
00:24:01.993 --> 00:24:30.669
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that like one thing that is really good and important is that you have good relationships with at least some of your teachers. And I think, like as you go into 8th grade and high school. This is something to prioritize more and more, too, because teachers are really in your corner, and they're they're there to support you with. Whether that's like extra resources for studying, preparing for academic competitions outside of school and everything else. So I think, like prioritizing your relationship with your teachers, even from your age, from your grade level, is going to be really important.

221
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:37.744
Jenny Duan: So yeah, I'm glad that you know school seems to be going well, and it looks like you're making improvements in math, which is good.

222
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:56.190
Jenny Duan: I'd love to go in back and like talk about your hobbies and the things that you spend time on. So I would actually love to hear you walk through a day in your life, for example, like I know that it's summer now, but in school, like, say on a random Thursday, on a school day. How do you spend your day and time.

223
00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.340
Zainab Ahmed: So

224
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.310
Zainab Ahmed: I wake up. I do school

225
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.470
Zainab Ahmed: I'd like

226
00:25:06.323 --> 00:25:09.989
Zainab Ahmed: do all my school and school would end at 3, 10.

227
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.017
Zainab Ahmed: Yes, and then

228
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:30.193
Zainab Ahmed: After that we come, I, me and my brother. We stay a bit like after school for some club sometimes, and then it's like it's around 4 or 4 30 when we get back home from school, and then

229
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:38.130
Zainab Ahmed: and then me. I eat like food lunch, and then

230
00:25:38.562 --> 00:25:44.599
Zainab Ahmed: maybe take a shower or something. Then I get to my classes and study.

231
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.743
Zainab Ahmed: and then

232
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.129
Zainab Ahmed: at like around 5 to

233
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:58.619
Zainab Ahmed: 8. That would be like this classes and studying period. And then after that, I'd have like a little bit of free time to do whatever I wanted, like

234
00:25:59.054 --> 00:26:08.999
Zainab Ahmed: like watch TV, or like or do anything, something with my family, and then around like 9, 10, I'd go to sleep.

235
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:18.079
Jenny Duan: Okay, that's like a pretty good schedule that's pretty solid. And then what does your summer schedule look like? How are you spending your summer.

236
00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:41.589
Zainab Ahmed: Basically if we're not going anywhere that day or like we're not doing anything with other people. I'd wake up. I'd like just taking morning shower. I'd eat my breakfast, and then I'd help clean the house a bit. I'd clean my room like myself, and then I'd

237
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:59.260
Zainab Ahmed: probably do some summer work like since there's no school, and I kinda have to like study a lot. So I'd study and sometimes we take breaks. I take breaks to like, go bike around.

238
00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:07.079
Zainab Ahmed: yeah. And we also have a dog outside. So we do play with him like catch and stuff.

239
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.330
Jenny Duan: Old is your dog.

240
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.620
Zainab Ahmed: He's like

241
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.179
Zainab Ahmed: 2 years old, I think.

242
00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.470
Jenny Duan: What's a puppy.

243
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.129
Zainab Ahmed: Well, actually, he's a husky, and he's really big.

244
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.379
Jenny Duan: Oh, wow! So no! A grown dog, but a young dog.

245
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.060
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah.

246
00:27:21.764 --> 00:27:25.719
Zainab Ahmed: we also have a cat. So I do play with her, too.

247
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.679
Jenny Duan: So do it.

248
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.260
Zainab Ahmed: She's like 8 years old, I think.

249
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.779
Jenny Duan: Really cute. Have you had her like since she was a kitten, or did you get her when she was a little bit older?

250
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.030
Zainab Ahmed: We got her since she was a kitten.

251
00:27:40.098 --> 00:27:46.551
Zainab Ahmed: And then yeah, or I'd play with my little brother, we'd play like volleyball or something.

252
00:27:47.508 --> 00:27:58.979
Zainab Ahmed: And then like, though that's what we would do between in our breaks. And then we just spend our time like that when my mom's home and my dad's home.

253
00:27:59.449 --> 00:28:04.259
Zainab Ahmed: Sometimes we just like watch, TV, or like, hang out with each other.

254
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:10.360
Zainab Ahmed: And then we just do that until it gets tonight. We eat dinner, and then

255
00:28:10.697 --> 00:28:15.399
Zainab Ahmed: if we hadn't already watched TV, we'd watch like a family movie at night and then go to sleep.

256
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:28.940
Jenny Duan: Got it. Yeah, that's super. That sounds like a really relaxing summer. I know that one thing that I saw on your form is that you signed up for the library team volunteer program. Can you tell me a bit about what that looks like?

257
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:37.209
Zainab Ahmed: Okay, so I recently signed up for the library teams reach program. I'm

258
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.490
Zainab Ahmed: so

259
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:42.509
Zainab Ahmed: I'm gonna start volunteering at a

260
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:48.677
Zainab Ahmed: local library which is near us. I haven't started yet, but

261
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.774
Zainab Ahmed: another orientation is in July.

262
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:59.700
Zainab Ahmed: The orientation is, we have to attend the orientation. So it's gonna be July, yeah. So I'm gonna start it in July.

263
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.119
Zainab Ahmed: yeah, that's it.

264
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.080
Jenny Duan: And why did you choose to do this program.

265
00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:26.290
Zainab Ahmed: I wanted to kind of volunteer at something, but I didn't know what, and I felt like the library would be the best option for that cause, like it's just a starting point for me to volunteer at something and like it was kind of near us, and I could just drive there and help out with some books, and it seemed like a nice opportunity.

266
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:33.360
Jenny Duan: That makes sense. Have you done any? This is your 1st volunteer experience. Then you haven't done anything in the past.

267
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.740
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah. It's my first.st

268
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:57.710
Jenny Duan: Got it. And okay. So right now, I'd actually love to go back into your other hobbies. So I know we talked about art we talked about volleyball. Are there any other like really big passions of yours like, do you like music? Any other sports? Anything else that you do? It doesn't have to be anything academic. It could be anything like watching anime like biking like, what are your other hobbies or things that you spend a lot of time doing.

269
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.479
Zainab Ahmed: I do like

270
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:16.750
Zainab Ahmed: playing like outside like with my bike. Also, I do like biking and I also like to play Badminton. This started in about

271
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:20.547
Zainab Ahmed: this year in 7th grade, and PE when

272
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:30.029
Zainab Ahmed: i we had a p unit of badminton, and like, I just found out that I was really good at it, and like I wanted to continue playing

273
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.429
Zainab Ahmed: so like it was kind of fun for me. And

274
00:30:33.802 --> 00:30:39.630
Zainab Ahmed: like in my free time I want to play batman with my brother and my friends.

275
00:30:40.645 --> 00:30:44.469
Zainab Ahmed: I also do like watching anime and reading manga.

276
00:30:44.871 --> 00:30:52.488
Zainab Ahmed: I kind of binge watch it a lot when in my free time, too. So like, and yeah, sometimes I draw it like

277
00:30:53.267 --> 00:30:55.352
Zainab Ahmed: when I want to. But

278
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.870
Zainab Ahmed: yeah, that's basically

279
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.356
Zainab Ahmed: my hobbies. I don't. I'm I'm not really

280
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:08.150
Zainab Ahmed: like more into the music type of like

281
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.595
Zainab Ahmed: things. But I did try music like

282
00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:23.750
Zainab Ahmed: I tried piano and violin like it didn't really seem I didn't have a passion about it.

283
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.023
Jenny Duan: Got it.

284
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:36.879
Jenny Duan: that makes sense to me. And I actually am curious, like with Badminton. Do you play competitively like, do you play on a recreational team? Or do you only play with your friends and in school.

285
00:31:37.422 --> 00:31:53.839
Zainab Ahmed: No, I only play with my friends in school. I wanted there to be a Badminton team in my school, but unfortunately there isn't any, and there's a Badminton Badminton team in high school, so I'm like planning on joining that when I get to high school.

286
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.560
Jenny Duan: That's really good. Do you also play on a club team? Are there club teams near you?

287
00:31:57.885 --> 00:32:01.464
Zainab Ahmed: No, there's no club teams. Which I have found yet.

288
00:32:02.396 --> 00:32:19.679
Zainab Ahmed: I did play tennis school school tennis, which was like I thought it would be kind of similar to Badminton. So I did join that team. And I did, and it was like every Friday I played for a short amount of time, and it was like also kind of fun.

289
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:24.030
Jenny Duan: Have you ever played pickleball? It's super popular right now.

290
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:46.650
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, I have. It was a PE unit and at 1st I was actually really bad at it, like I just hated like the plastic ball. I just didn't know how to play, but then after time, like, after practicing a lot and PE, it got kind of fun, and like, we got like matches and rounds with each other like my classmates. And it was actually really fun. So yeah.

291
00:32:47.580 --> 00:33:13.979
Jenny Duan: It'd be cool to consider pickleball, too, if you want to play that, because I know that it's like a rising sport. So there's a lot of funding and a lot of attention on pickleball right now, and like, because not as many people play it compared to other sports, it's easier to be good on, like a national or regional level, because, like, there's less people there. So if you are considering bracket sports, I think out of all them like Badminton and Pickleball are really good, because they'll give you a better opportunity to stand out as a player, because, like, there's a lot less. People who play them?

292
00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:15.539
Jenny Duan: Does that make sense.

293
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.380
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah.

294
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:31.610
Jenny Duan: Okay. So I think I would highly recommend you to check out like, if there's a competitive leak in your area or the place, you can train a little bit more seriously, because I think like being an athlete is a really cool thing like volleyball pickleball that mentioned all those things will like, really be good for you.

295
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:47.039
Jenny Duan: and then for the for the medicine and manga con connection. I actually think that there's a really interesting opportunity here for you to learn about like doing medical art?

296
00:33:47.344 --> 00:34:08.075
Jenny Duan: Because I don't know if you know about this, or if you've heard about this, but in a lot of medical textbooks. All of the like illustrations there are not diverse. So, like most of the medical textbooks, come from the eighties or the nineties. And it's all specifically like mostly white men that are drawn, for example, in all the anatomy, diagrams, and all like the

297
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:28.070
Jenny Duan: like organs and all the diseases like, for example, with even with dermatology, like all the skin diseases, are drawn only on like white bodies. But that means that in dermatology, especially a lot of different skin conditions like they look different, depending on the color of your skin, because, like, they'll show up differently. That's like pretty obvious, but a lot of medical textbooks

298
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:39.179
Jenny Duan: only have, like white bodies, especially in dermatology, and this causes a lot of like misdiagnoses in terms of what diseases, or what treatments people are prescribed, and that actually creates a lot of like

299
00:34:39.477 --> 00:35:00.270
Jenny Duan: excessive medication. Like assignments, prescriptions, but also like it harms a lot of people because they're diagnosed with the wrong disease, because doctors like they're just they just don't know what like a certain condition or certain illness looks like on people of different bodies or people of different skin colors. And so right now, there's a big need for people to do like medical illustration on diverse people.

300
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:09.017
Jenny Duan: And I think that like this is actually a really impactful project that if you wanted to take on, I think you could do some research or some work in this area, like, let me find

301
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.648
Jenny Duan: like an article that illustrates this.

302
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.689
Zainab Ahmed: Okay, yeah, that sounds really nice and interesting.

303
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.203
Jenny Duan: like, for example. Do you know the

304
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:29.609
Jenny Duan: Do you know the Comp? Do you know the company? Johnson and Johnson, like the pharmaceuticals.

305
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.649
Zainab Ahmed: Like the one who creates like the baby stuff.

306
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.194
Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, they, they create like various like products.

307
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.990
Jenny Duan: but like.

308
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:57.350
Jenny Duan: this is an article that they released last year about like diversity and medical illustration, because, according to this, like 2018, study that they cite in this article which you can open if you want only out of 4,100 medical textbook images, only 4.5

309
00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:19.359
Jenny Duan: showed dark skin tones, and only 18% of medical images from the New England journal of Medicine depicted non white skin. So you can see how this is like a really big issue, especially if you want to go into dermatology because, obviously, like skin conditions are going to look different on people with different colored skin like that's just an obvious fact. And like, if doctors don't know that

310
00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:39.650
Jenny Duan: If doctors don't know how to diagnosis or in disease, then like that's gonna go mistreated because, like the textbooks just don't show that for people. And so I think, like, because you're really good at art. And you're also really interested in specifically dermatology. I think that like this is a project that you could take on later down the line. I think this would be like really interesting.

311
00:36:40.074 --> 00:36:58.169
Jenny Duan: But curious what your thoughts are on this. The reason why I'm introducing. This is because I think like, because you're starting to look into community service like library volunteering like, there are many ways you can do service and like make an impact in the fields, that you have a big passion. And I think this is a good way to combine your passion for art and medicine, specifically dermatology.

312
00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.409
Jenny Duan: But yeah, curious what you think.

313
00:37:01.522 --> 00:37:04.957
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, that's actually a really interesting

314
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:11.601
Zainab Ahmed: idea. And I also

315
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:13.440
Zainab Ahmed: like

316
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:27.909
Zainab Ahmed: when I read the article just now. It's interest me. And I think I could do some researching on this topic. And yeah, I could like, see if I want to actually do this or not.

317
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:32.302
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So this is like another link I sent to you. This is like a

318
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:48.530
Jenny Duan: illustrate change, which is, I think, a nonprofit that has a library of medical illustrations with people of color so like, if you wanted to contribute to a journal like this, if you want to start your own nonprofit something like that that would be cool, because, like, according to this, Johnson and Johnson, article

319
00:37:48.950 --> 00:38:13.580
Jenny Duan: 62 of providers of doctors incorrectly identified melanoma, which is skin cancer on black skin compared to 13 on white skin. So like people are misdiagnosing cancer like 62 of the time on black skin, which is like 62 misdiagnosis rate for cancer is really really terrible. Because, like obviously, cancer, you know, it takes people's lives and like

320
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:18.739
Jenny Duan: 62% on black skin versus 13% on white skin. That's like a pretty shocking statistic.

321
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:30.196
Jenny Duan: So anyways, I just thought like, this would be a cool opportunity for you to explore, because it seems connected to your interests. And I think another thing that if you're interested in

322
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:40.500
Jenny Duan: if you're interested in anime and also art like you could also think about and if you're also interested in journalism, you could also think about doing like.

323
00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:47.920
Jenny Duan: have you ever done social media, or like any type of like video editing, or any type of like thing like that.

324
00:38:49.165 --> 00:38:55.819
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, when I was younger, I did like edit some videos. And Imovie like

325
00:38:55.870 --> 00:39:01.169
Zainab Ahmed: it wasn't like, really that much. But I did do some editing

326
00:39:01.597 --> 00:39:05.470
Zainab Ahmed: at some point in like 5, th 5th grade, 6th grade.

327
00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:21.435
Jenny Duan: Yeah, for so for anime, if you're interested in that, like, I know that there's a big place to like, do video edits or like be on social media as like an anime commentator like, I think social media is a very like underlooked opportunity for

328
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.620
Jenny Duan: before.

329
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:50.240
Jenny Duan: I guess, connection, or for a growing impact in a certain area. So like, that's another thing you can think about, I know, like someone at Stanford, she had to have like an anime edit account, and she has, like 1 million followers on Tiktok, and I think that was like one of her biggest extracurriculars when coming to college. So the point is, I mean, you definitely don't have to do this. But the point is, when you think about like college extracurriculars or things that you do a lot of people have a very narrow mindset, or like they're like, Oh, you need to be in like

330
00:39:50.390 --> 00:40:19.009
Jenny Duan: Xyz, like academic club. Or, Oh, you need to like, do math competitions or something. But like that's not for everyone. Regardless of what you do like. As long as you're interested in it, you can make a big impact. Whether that's like doing medical illustrations having an anime fan account on Instagram, like all of that, can count as an extracurricular. So like, do what you think is enjoyable and like, put your best into it and like, don't worry about what other people think, because I think the more unique. You make your profile the better chance you have of standing out against others. And so, like.

331
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:23.867
Jenny Duan: yeah, regardless of where your interests are. Like. All of that is 100% valid.

332
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:35.699
Jenny Duan: And so I think that like, that's another avenue for you to explore in terms of academics, though. So you said that you like science the best. What aspect of science do you like.

333
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:41.180
Zainab Ahmed: I like learning about

334
00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:51.630
Zainab Ahmed: sometimes, like the thing that interests me the most is when we learn about like what's in the human body. Like

335
00:40:52.731 --> 00:41:02.188
Zainab Ahmed: your heart like your brain. More to that. And I also like learning about

336
00:41:03.813 --> 00:41:05.400
Zainab Ahmed: some like

337
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.020
Zainab Ahmed: the aspects of life as in

338
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:12.260
Zainab Ahmed: animals, ecosystems, things like that.

339
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.500
Zainab Ahmed: I'm.

340
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:27.750
Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, the other thing I was thinking about actually is because you're really interested in animals. And like, it seems like you really like you have to a dog and a cat. You really like pets? Have you ever thought about volunteering at a vet shelter, or like an animal? Hospital?

341
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.825
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, she she would love that. She loved animals.

342
00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:52.999
Jenny Duan: Cause. I think that's also like a really good thing that you could pursue, because since you wanna be a doctor like again, a big part about being a doctor is like taking care of people and like, if you you know that a lot of medical things like you have to be a certain age, because, like, obviously, you're dealing with other patients like, there's certain forms. But I think that might be a little bit looser, for like animals. So if

343
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:03.030
Jenny Duan: if you're able to volunteer at a vet shelter, you can still demonstrate those skills of like caring for an animal being able to understand its needs like providing for it, and all of those are essential to be like

344
00:42:03.294 --> 00:42:18.900
Jenny Duan: a doctor, too. And so I think, like that is a really good avenue for you to take, because I think that shelters, and, like animal hospitals, tend to have a lower barrier of entry for volunteers, because, like you're not working with people, but it's still a good opportunity for you to learn about the science behind

345
00:42:19.156 --> 00:42:36.620
Jenny Duan: animals. Maybe you can look at like the animal surgery like shadow that and things like that, and still learn about like medicine, even if it's not on humans, because there is a lot of like applicable knowledge from animals to humans. And like, there's a lot you can learn by working with animals. So I think, like, that's something that you can think about doing, too.

346
00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.740
Jenny Duan: I'm in.

347
00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:53.866
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I would make a note like, I think, if you could look into what it's like to volunteer at a vet shelter or an animal shelter in your community. Because the thing that I think right now you're a little bit

348
00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:08.538
Jenny Duan: You're only you're missing is a little bit of that community service element which you're already starting to do with the library. But I think, like we can add more in terms of the the vet service, or the medical illustrations and things like that.

349
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.913
Jenny Duan: so that could be a good route for you.

350
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:23.160
Jenny Duan: What are some things that you're concerned about in terms of, like your preparedness, or like any questions that you have about going into 8th grade or high school like, are you nervous about anything?

351
00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:41.684
Zainab Ahmed: I think the most part is, I'm not nervous in going to 8th grade, but I am pretty nervous going into high school, cause. That's when, like, probably everything like actually matters and like your grades, what you do, how you act, everything like actually matters. And it's kinda like,

352
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:49.759
Zainab Ahmed: what's gonna get you into college and what won't like a good college. So like, yeah, I am pretty nervous from high school.

353
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:59.379
Jenny Duan: Gotcha and I think, like, in terms of college, like, what are you most concerned about in your college prep journey like, do you have any

354
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.729
Jenny Duan: things like besides, what to do like anything else that you're nervous about.

355
00:44:05.257 --> 00:44:10.294
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, I don't know which courses I wanna take yet. But

356
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:25.940
Zainab Ahmed: I also like I don't really know how it's gonna be there. So I am kind of nervous of how high school will go like, especially 9th grade cause like you're just coming into there.

357
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:27.880
Jenny Duan: Yeah. First.st

358
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:34.638
Jenny Duan: I think that you know you'll be on a good path. So I think we'll definitely be able to

359
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.160
Jenny Duan: We'll be able to address that.

360
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:40.520
Jenny Duan: And

361
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:55.579
Jenny Duan: yeah, so are you planning on entering any more art competitions? Because I think if you really like our, I think this could be a really good path for you, because there's a lot of opportunities for young artists to get involved in like competitions, galleries, and things like that.

362
00:44:57.659 --> 00:45:04.230
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, I I will. Enter more conversations with more drawings and paintings.

363
00:45:05.413 --> 00:45:07.380
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah. So we'll do that.

364
00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.869
Zainab Ahmed: You would love to write.

365
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.999
Jenny Duan: Are you interested in art, history at all, or just art.

366
00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:24.327
Zainab Ahmed: I feel like just art cause, like I've never really finished in history of anything. I mean anything in art. But

367
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:32.969
Zainab Ahmed: I do know some artists, and which I am interested in like, which are old artists like

368
00:45:33.603 --> 00:45:35.726
Zainab Ahmed: either it's like pay costs or

369
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:44.371
Zainab Ahmed: artists like that. Leonardo da Vinci. They're art styles, and it's all very interesting to me.

370
00:45:46.234 --> 00:45:46.830
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah.

371
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:53.156
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm asking, because I think it's like also, maybe a good idea for you to learn about

372
00:45:53.730 --> 00:46:13.800
Jenny Duan: like art gallery curation, or like art history for like culture and media. Because I think like a lot of young people don't really pay attention to art history. And like, I think that like, if you want to be involved in the art world, that's a really cool opportunity to take, like, I know, a friend who worked at art museums and like worked in curation. And

373
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:27.967
Jenny Duan: I think like that's super interesting, because not a lot of young people do that. So that's something that could set you apart. If you are interested in like learning more about gallery life, or like what it's like to be able to explain art to other people, I think like that could be cool.

374
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:38.580
Jenny Duan: I think what I'm trying to come up with is just like a bunch of different ideas for you to explore, because I think when you're in middle school, especially in your last year of middle school, you have the time to explore different extracurriculars.

375
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:41.160
Jenny Duan: and

376
00:46:41.505 --> 00:46:59.374
Jenny Duan: I think that like when you go into high school, you're not gonna have as much of an opportunity to like, pick and choose what you do, because you'll be like more locked into your schoolwork and everything else. But when you're in 8th grade you have the time to really explore. And so I think our history is like another area that I would recommend that you explore and like, take a look into because

377
00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:06.759
Jenny Duan: I think it'll it could be a good opportunity to set you apart. Is there anything that you've like always wanted to try, but never got the opportunity to do.

378
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:15.175
Zainab Ahmed: not that I can think of. Maybe like

379
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:29.679
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, I think just I'm gonna go for Badminton High School. I didn't really get the opportunity to do it here in middle school, but I will eventually go for that in high school.

380
00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:35.270
Jenny Duan: Yeah. What else? Like, anything else? Random.

381
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.410
Zainab Ahmed: A,

382
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:44.390
Zainab Ahmed: and I do like enjoy

383
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.170
Zainab Ahmed: like

384
00:47:54.056 --> 00:48:03.013
Zainab Ahmed: I'm I've never really been interested in making any games or anything but I do like

385
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.420
Zainab Ahmed: I do want to make a game on

386
00:48:07.273 --> 00:48:10.790
Zainab Ahmed: roadblocks. With my friend.

387
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.020
Jenny Duan: Can you tell me more about that.

388
00:48:14.356 --> 00:48:15.630
Zainab Ahmed: Sure so

389
00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:31.186
Zainab Ahmed: like me and my friend, we kind of wanted to make like a game in a box like where she would do like all the like coding and stuff, and I'd like design how it would go, and like

390
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:38.831
Zainab Ahmed: which shapes go where and we kind of wanted to make a game on there, but like I never really got the chance to do so.

391
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:40.210
Zainab Ahmed: I mean what.

392
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.640
Jenny Duan: Would you want to create.

393
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.600
Zainab Ahmed: Huh!

394
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:44.689
Jenny Duan: What type of game would you want to create.

395
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.881
Zainab Ahmed: Oh, like kinda like this

396
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:50.609
Zainab Ahmed: fun like

397
00:48:51.250 --> 00:49:00.009
Zainab Ahmed: not really like role playing. But like it's kinda like you, where you could build things like what you want and like

398
00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:09.300
Zainab Ahmed: like you could go places like there would be like cars and things like that, and like it would kind of be like real life. But again.

399
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.529
Jenny Duan: That's cool. Do you play Roblox often.

400
00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.005
Zainab Ahmed: Hmm, yeah, I do play box

401
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:24.939
Zainab Ahmed: and my free time sometimes, like I usually play with my brother and my friends some horror. Games on it. Kind of fun.

402
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:32.249
Jenny Duan: Do you like game development in general? Or do you just like roadblocks like, have you ever thought about coding like a unity game, or like any coding at all.

403
00:49:32.753 --> 00:49:36.190
Zainab Ahmed: No, just reflects, I'm not really interested in coding anything.

404
00:49:38.546 --> 00:49:41.010
Jenny Duan: Why aren't you interested in coding? Have you tried it?

405
00:49:41.875 --> 00:49:52.144
Zainab Ahmed: I have. I'm I'm doing a programming classes right now, but I don't really find like it that interesting like the best to me cause like

406
00:49:52.670 --> 00:50:07.330
Zainab Ahmed: She she's taking coding classes, but she she does not want it. Her her dad is is a programmer, so they they want them to learn coding. But yeah, it. It does not seem interesting to them at all.

407
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.280
Zainab Ahmed: I don't know. Maybe maybe you can

408
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:22.319
Zainab Ahmed: give them some another direction on coding, just like you give another direction on the art and and medical, so I don't know you. You are. You're playing magic right now.

409
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:27.030
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Well, I think coding is like, it's gonna be

410
00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:51.209
Jenny Duan: maybe useful for whatever you do like, I think it's good to have a basic understanding of how it works. But I totally understand what you mean, because I think when I've always tried to learn coding, too, and it's never really come as something that's been natural to me like I can code. I know how to build websites as I could do it, but like it's never really felt natural to me, and I know what it feels like when something is more natural, and when something's like more of a challenge. So I think, like

411
00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:59.779
Jenny Duan: you can. There's bunch of things that I think are important to learn. But I would say, like, it's also important to pursue things that you find personally meaningful and like

412
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.892
Jenny Duan: a good fit for you like are, even if

413
00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:31.080
Jenny Duan: like. You can't necessarily see the applications of it right away, because I think there's always going to be something important that you can spin out of it if you just keep pursuing what you're passionate about, because what you do in high school doesn't necessarily have to be directly related to your major in college, because colleges want well-rounded people, and they want people who have interests and who aren't just going to become workers right? They want people who have ideas, who can change the world, not just people who like want to get a job.

414
00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:52.499
Jenny Duan: And that's the difference between top schools. And like, okay, schools is like top schools. The schools that you would want to go to are schools that cultivate people who want to change the world and want to have these big ideas and not just like enter the professional world while getting a job is still really important, I mean, obviously. But that's like, not their only purpose or motivation in life.

415
00:51:52.790 --> 00:52:06.994
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think, we've talked about some cool talked about some cool, like different opportunities for you to pursue. I'm curious, like what clubs are available at your school and like, are you involved in any other clubs, besides Badminton and and

416
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.840
Jenny Duan: and volleyball.

417
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:27.749
Zainab Ahmed: there! There was like a few clubs that I did go to there was a chess club which, like me and my brother we kinda like went for like a few days when it was really on

418
00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:54.059
Zainab Ahmed: I was like kinda after school, so when we like weren't picked up that early would go there. We they would just kind of play like chess, and like teach different strategies to it. I'd say, like my little brother, he'd be more interested in chess. I also do like. When I'm start playing I start to play. I do get like interested more in chess.

419
00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:21.309
Zainab Ahmed: So the game is actually fun to do and like, it's fun to strategize and think about your next move. So I did do that club. I also wanted to do the cooking club, but like you kinda had to join it before like something, and then someday, and I didn't join it, cause like I was kind of new to the school, so I didn't know I was supposed to say, I did want to do that, but like

420
00:53:21.973 --> 00:53:23.989
Zainab Ahmed: maybe next year, this year.

421
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:25.240
Zainab Ahmed: yeah, this year.

422
00:53:25.584 --> 00:53:32.470
Jenny Duan: This year. And with Chess Club. Have you ever watched Queen's Gambit? I'm curious. If you've seen that show.

423
00:53:32.778 --> 00:53:38.331
Zainab Ahmed: I've seen it definitely, Netflix. But I don't. I don't think my mom let me watch it.

424
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.090
Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. Yeah. I think it's definitely like.

425
00:53:42.880 --> 00:54:00.480
Jenny Duan: there's some. There's some. There's some content there. But I think it's a good show. And I think like watching. That made me want to play chess, so I don't know if you ever felt that way, but I think chess is cool because it trains the way that you think like, do you have you spent a lot of time learning chess? Is this an area that you would want to learn more in the future, or like, are you done with it?

426
00:54:01.095 --> 00:54:06.405
Zainab Ahmed: I'm not like done with it, but I wouldn't wanna learn more in it, cause like I just

427
00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:17.220
Zainab Ahmed: like what I feel. The best move is, I just go there so like I wouldn't really learn it. But I do like playing it sometimes. When my little brother wants to play. I'll play with it.

428
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.400
Jenny Duan: That makes sense. Do you generally like board games or strategy games.

429
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:28.177
Zainab Ahmed: I do like board games. Yeah, I do also like strategy games. I also like

430
00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:38.980
Zainab Ahmed: Like luck games like monopoly. There you have. There's luck, and there's strategizing there, too. So like, that's 1 of my favorite games.

431
00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.179
Jenny Duan: Do you? Have you ever thought about designing your own game

432
00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.750
Jenny Duan: like? Because

433
00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:50.700
Jenny Duan: that's something you could totally do if you've ever thought about that like a card game, a board game like anything like that.

434
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:57.339
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, when I was little, I did like try to make board games like we me and

435
00:54:58.273 --> 00:55:08.026
Zainab Ahmed: my brother, and like some maybe, like neighbors. Their kids we would try to like make games.

436
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:12.499
Zainab Ahmed: Oh, I don't know if you've heard like about among us.

437
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:15.440
Jenny Duan: Yeah. I have heard about among us.

438
00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:21.588
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, so like me and my neighbors, we like we made that. But like in real life.

439
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:23.400
Jenny Duan: Can you tell me about that.

440
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:44.332
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, so like, like all the tasks and things we would like make them on cardboard. And like, we like work together to like make at all on cardboard, and like we'd have like imposter cards and like crewmate cards. So it's kind of really fun there. So like that got us into like more

441
00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:58.980
Zainab Ahmed: doing like fun and like exciting things like creating games like that. We did create our own like imaginary games when like when I was like younger? So yeah, that was actually kind of fun.

442
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:18.180
Jenny Duan: Yeah, at Stanford we have this design class, where the 1st assignment is actually to create a game. And I think like creating games might be cool, because you're obviously really talented at art, and it seems like you like playing games like among us some chess other things. And so it'd be a like a really cool thing to create a game and like

443
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:30.969
Jenny Duan: make it about some social impact area or something like that. One of my friends at Stanford. Actually one of his biggest extracurriculars in high school was designing this game called Crisis on Cardea. Let me send this to you.

444
00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:38.200
Jenny Duan: and he like built this card game. He did like all the R. And he raised money on Kickstarter. Do you know what Kickstarter is.

445
00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.569
Zainab Ahmed: Oh, no, I don't.

446
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.849
Jenny Duan: Well, he he created this game, and

447
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:54.450
Jenny Duan: he raised money like people donated it on donated online. And he like, released this game. But you could look at this link. Do you? Have you kicked? Clicked on it.

448
00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:55.170
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah. Thanks.

449
00:56:55.715 --> 00:56:56.870
Jenny Duan: Crisis on Cardea.

450
00:56:57.322 --> 00:57:01.209
Jenny Duan: This is a game about like educating players about

451
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:27.259
Jenny Duan: the medical and emergency professionals that help us every day, and I think they fundraise for people for healthcare workers during the pandemic for the sales of this game. And so I think this is something that you could totally totally do like. You're so good at art, you could totally make a card game a board game and actually get it in production, and not only be able to play it yourself, but like raise money for a cause that you care about.

452
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:39.420
Jenny Duan: And I think that, like, I don't know, this is sounds interesting to you, but I think it would be like a cool project to work on if you're already thinking about making what blocks games, and you could do this with a group of people. It doesn't have to be just by yourself.

453
00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:43.719
Zainab Ahmed: Yeah, sounds really interesting and fun to do might do that.

454
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:44.865
Jenny Duan: Yeah,

455
00:57:46.420 --> 00:58:13.710
Jenny Duan: So yeah, I think with that, I'm gonna kind of recap what we talked about. And I wanna give you like about 5 min to ask any questions that you might have. So today we spent a lot of time discussing your interests, how you're doing in school and what you wanna what you wanna do in the future. We came up with like 3 different we came actually, I think, more than 3 different extracurriculars or projects for you. So the card game, like social impact card game, is one. We also talked about the medical illustrations.

456
00:58:14.028 --> 00:58:25.809
Jenny Duan: For, like diverse medical illustrations. For the second one we talked about joining Badminton and Pickleball in high school. We also talked about social media and like potentially making like an anime or manga like

457
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:30.455
Jenny Duan: edit or fan account and we also talked about

458
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:48.390
Jenny Duan: like perhaps volunteering at the vet shelter or animal shelter. I think that these are all like really good opportunities for you to work towards your goal of becoming a doctor. Well, so like becoming a more well rounded student in person. Do you have any questions about everything that we talked about today, or like

459
00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.590
Jenny Duan: anything else that you're concerned about or interested in discussing.

460
00:58:53.695 --> 00:58:58.420
Zainab Ahmed: I do not have any questions. You explained it actually, really pretty well, do you?

461
00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:12.890
Zainab Ahmed: No, okay. It was. It was very, very I would say so fruitful like i i i didn't even know so much about her as you. You could explore in in like the 1 h.

462
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:15.969
Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I'm doing.

463
00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:16.779
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

464
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:22.359
Siraj Nazir: It. It was really, you know, quite magic. And I mean, I always try to see. There's probably some bias when girls.

465
00:59:22.714 --> 00:59:32.625
Zainab Ahmed: I knew that she's really good at art, and she has like those anime she's into it. And then she's are like, really sketch, really well, and then

466
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:42.069
Zainab Ahmed: no pain painting. She does that. But these are sketches she makes really all always. I like admire that you you you made this so? Well.

467
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:46.489
Zainab Ahmed: so, yeah. And then how it would relate to her profession. That is amazing.

468
00:59:49.850 --> 01:00:07.290
Siraj Nazir: Exactly, very, very interesting. And and in fact, you know, there's always more magic when girls and girls connect. Actually, I do see that. It's very good. I'm I'm dad of 2 daughters. So I I love it, and just see like how interesting and beautiful your profile is, and your passions. And that's the thing that we lot of us, especially like, you know.

469
01:00:08.003 --> 01:00:13.649
Siraj Nazir: Coming from the subcontinent parents like Asian parents, typically, we, we don't understand that

470
01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:18.330
Siraj Nazir: these qualities are the biggest differentiation and standout factors.

471
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:36.770
Siraj Nazir: Because how many really like, how many girls like from this kind of a background from Pakistan are actually, you know, doing like anime. And then, but also like talking about games and art, and also interested, you know, in dermatology like, think about it like, that's unique, isn't it? That's so different. So I think anything and everything is relevant.

472
01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:52.290
Siraj Nazir: So and this is just like, I'm I was absolutely quite impressed, pleasantly surprised on how many projects you know, just like in a you know, in an hour like, you know, imagine. And and this cannot happen alone. Right? That is where I was trying to tell this to. Your mom earlier, too.

473
01:00:52.300 --> 01:01:09.409
Siraj Nazir: Why, the weekly time and execution is important, because this is where the magic happens, like our coaches, like Jenny, can have this brilliant framework, and they can try to really understand you, but it can only happen when you also share your context, right? So you are equally a part of what you have created here.

474
01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:29.010
Siraj Nazir: And I, you know, I I can't wait. So what we're gonna do as a next step is again, you know. Because, you know, you've already started the program. And you're gonna have. You know, kind of an initial kind of a game plan that, Jenny, because, being our head coach, and she's done a very, very. But you see, like Jenny is not biomed, but you see like how well where she is, and bio like. That's the point, I'm trying to say.

475
01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:41.880
Siraj Nazir: because they've all gone through this journey but then we'll figure out, you know, the best kind of long term coach that we can assign, and again, I think, for now I think. Marissa is actually one of our top coaches for bio

476
01:01:42.137 --> 01:02:03.279
Siraj Nazir: and she's a Stanford medical student. She's gone through the journey of medicine and doctor, right? So there's more relevance there. But again, it doesn't have to be necessary. But we we will kind of discuss this in a team meeting, and we'll look at both your profiles, and we'll then see what's a good time. Probably next week we can start with one or 2 sessions, because there's still summer. And also one thing I want, like, you know, to for for parents to take away.

477
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:10.709
Siraj Nazir: See summer. It's not like you only do summer. You know these activities? Right? It's a tenure and passion. It's it's like a year-long journey.

478
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:22.699
Siraj Nazir: So these projects, you know that the gaming project that Jenny was talking about her friend's example, or you know what she's proposing now very, very impressive, that a dermatology kind of project that she spoke about, or the art project.

479
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.759
Siraj Nazir: These have to take shape over years. It cannot just be like a 1 summer affair.

480
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:32.599
Siraj Nazir: and independent projects in the admissions actually are highly valued

481
01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:56.520
Siraj Nazir: than the going to boot camps, you know. So your projects are much more highly valued. So you have to always remember that. Okay, so thanks a lot, Jenny, you know. And thanks a lot. So we'll you know, in in a week's time you'll get an initial kind of a draft game plan, and Mary will reach out to set up the next meeting. You know, I'm hoping it's gonna be Melissa at this time, mainly because of the bio kind of focus.

482
01:02:56.794 --> 01:03:11.609
Siraj Nazir: But again, you know, we do couple of weeks, and then we identify like a passion project might be. There's something that we need another coach to come in and help you on a few weeks. Then we'll bring in. Yeah, we work as a team right? They will be a primary coach for assigned for you. But we all always work like a team. Okay.

483
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.122
Zainab Ahmed: Thank you, Jenny. Thank you so much.

484
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:19.949
Siraj Nazir: Nice meeting you zed up. You're an awesome, awesome girl, and you can also meet my daughter. Actually

485
01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:21.499
Siraj Nazir: take care, bye.

486
01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.750
Zainab Ahmed: Bye, bye.

487
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:23.500
Jenny Duan: Aye.
