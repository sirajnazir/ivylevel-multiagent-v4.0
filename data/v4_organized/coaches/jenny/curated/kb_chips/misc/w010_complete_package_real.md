## 🔑 **Week 10 Core Insight**

**Every crisis contains its own solution**: The students who excluded Huda from MSA inadvertently gave her a founder story more powerful than any officer position. Jenny's genius lies in instantly recognizing and articulating these transformations, turning victim narratives into creator stories within minutes.

**The verbal breakthrough technique** proves that authentic voice exists in every student - it just needs the right extraction method. When writing creates barriers, speaking dissolves them.

**Dad's transformation** from skeptic to advocate in a single session demonstrates the power of strategic parent inclusion. Witnessing sophisticated work in real-time converts doubters to champions.
