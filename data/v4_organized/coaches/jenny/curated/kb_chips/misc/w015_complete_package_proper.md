## 🔑 **Week 15 Core Insights**

**The Bookmark Technique** represents crisis management at its finest. By deferring the SAT discussion to celebrate Instagram success first, Jenny creates emotional resilience before tackling disappointment. This isn't avoidance—it's strategic emotional sequencing.

**The ChatGPT Voice Surgery** shows the importance of authenticity detection. Dad's identification of AI-like language triggers a complete rewrite that maintains ideas while restoring personal voice. The 17-minute investment prevents application disaster.

**The Confidence Preservation Architecture** demonstrates how to handle significant failure (160-point gap) without crushing self-belief. The combination of affirmation, perspective, and immediate action creates psychological safety during crisis.

**The Test-Optional Awareness** transforms crisis into strategy. By introducing multiple paths (ACT, test-optional, UC policy), Jenny reduces the catastrophic weight of a single test score.
