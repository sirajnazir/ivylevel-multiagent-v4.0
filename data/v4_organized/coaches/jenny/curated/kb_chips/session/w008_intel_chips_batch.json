Dad's powerful intervention exposes hidden struggle: 'Main struggle is anxiety, hyper local in her school,' revealing social isolation despite being best programmer. System rigging discovered - unable to get leadership despite superior skills, hackathon abandonment pattern where others steal ideas then leave. Summer activity audit shows impressive breadth: SAT study, game art development, YouTube launch, wedding filming, Figma designs, AI self-learning from Google course. Cultural barrier identified: Muslim identity hidden, new student status creates outsider disadvantage.","insight_vector":"Heat exhaustion impacts decisions; dad reveals anxiety/isolation; best programmer but system rigged; Muslim identity hidden"}
