Problem: 1400 → 1550 SAT feels impossible, complete game seems overwhelming. Solution: Break into achievable weekly steps. SAT example: Week 1 hit 1400 (baseline), Week 2 hit 1450 (+50 points feels doable), Week 3 hit 1500 (+50), Week 4 hit 1520 (+20), Week 5 hit 1530 (+10), Week 6-8 maintain 1550. Psychology: 50-point improvement = ~20 more correct answers, manageable. Game example: Not 'finish game in 8 weeks' but 'Week 1 outline layout, Week 2 build regression scene, Week 3 lore development' etc. Implementation: Create two documents: (1) Goals Tracker showing bird's eye weekly milestones, (2) Task Document with daily/weekly actionable items. Tangible goals (SAT scores, game features, post count) tracked separately from intangible goals (brand building, skill development). Benefits: Reduces paralysis, creates momentum through small wins, built-in accountability, easy to identify if falling behind. Replicability: Works for any 8-week intensive (college apps, test prep, project completion). The Personal Brand Framework + Role Model Cascade + First Three Principle + Barnard Backdoor all support this core planning architecture. Jenny's message throughout: 'Nothing stopping you' combined with concrete actionable steps makes impossible feel achievable.","themes":["8_week_planning","incremental_milestones","overwhelm_reduction","weekly_targets","tangible_intangible","accountability_structure","momentum_building","replicable_framework","possibility_mindset","actionable_steps"],"silver_bullet":true}
