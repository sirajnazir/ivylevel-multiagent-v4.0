AI ethics bootcamp failed (mission-driven, honor-based, vague benefits, no urgency) = barely anyone. EmpowHER Hacks succeeded ($23,000 prizes, exclusive 48-hour event, tangible benefits, time-bounded) = 100 participants from 16 countries. Formula: Exclusivity (limited vs open) + Tangible Benefits (prizes/resume vs learning) + Urgency (48 hours vs ongoing) + Social Proof (Stanford students vs generic) = Participation. Even sponsor logos (Wolfram, .xyz) and judge credentials (Google, Nvidia) signal legitimacy attracting participants. Discoverability matters: DevPost platform = active hackathon searchers vs random bootcamp invisibility. Psychology lessons: (1) Exclusivity creates value, (2) Tangible beats abstract, (3) Where target audience searches matters, (4) Social proof compounds. Jenny's teaching: 'Takes pressure off getting statistics, competitions work workshops don't, people can join for prizes discover mission later.' Replicability: Any struggling event should examine tangible benefit (not just learning), urgency (time-bounded exclusive), discoverability (established platforms where audience exists), legitimacy signals (sponsors, judges, elite participants). The Stanford Validation Marker + Discord Conversion Strategy + Wrong Side Resilience + MYNA Identity Integration all flow from this core prize psychology breakthrough.
