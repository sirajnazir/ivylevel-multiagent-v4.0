Jenny decomposes a realistic week (school 8h, sleep 8h, homework 4h, basics 2h) to surface a hard constraint: ~2 hours remain daily for high-leverage actions. This creates urgency, anchors weekly planning, and becomes the operating cadence for all execution: concentrate those 2 hours into proof-generating tasks (e.g., NCWIT scaffolding, outreach sprints, artifact production). The framework is revisited each week to reallocate time based on blockers and ROI.","insight_vector":"Post-assessment execution framework: 168-hour time math exposes ~2h/day for high-leverage tasks; drives weekly plan focus"}
