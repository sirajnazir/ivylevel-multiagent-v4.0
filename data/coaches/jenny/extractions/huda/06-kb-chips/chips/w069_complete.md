## 🥇 **Silver Bullets**

### 🎯 **The Best vs Favorite Framework**
Jenny: "They're not asking your favorite movie - what you can EVALUATE as objectively best." Distinction: personal preference vs critical analysis. Must defend choice with evidence (cinematography, themes, structure). Age of Adaline chosen: nostalgia + human values transcending time periods. Teaching method: Ratatouille example ("anyone can cook applies to life"), Interstellar ("cinematography change your life").

### 🎯 **The Depth Questioning Cascade**
Dream trip excavation. Surface: "See India cultural sites." Jenny cascade: (1) Why important? (2) Why alternatives fail? (3) What's deeper need? (4) Emotional core? (5) Value identification. Result: Time travel see grandma as teenager → understand family struggles → develop empathy. Each "why" reveals authentic layer.

### 🎯 **The Quality Over Quantity Principle**
~20 schools sufficient. Jenny: "No point squeezing extra applications." UNC deprioritized when Huda admits "not super passionate." Teacher relationships protected. Energy conserved genuine interests. Strategic focus vs application volume.

### 🎯 **The Teacher Relationship Protection**
Jenny: "Don't rush teachers if you don't personally want to apply." UNC early deadline requires teacher letters 2 weeks early. Preserving goodwill more valuable than marginal applications. Long-term relationship thinking.

### 🎯 **The Time Travel Dream Trip**
Creative pivot beyond geography. Jenny: "Think beyond geographical space - what about time travel?" Huda: "1950s see grandma as teenager." Depth: Why can't just ask parents? Because seeing them struggle creates empathy understanding. Unique memorable response.
