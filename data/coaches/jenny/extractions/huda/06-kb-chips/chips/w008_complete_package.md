- **Participants**: Jenny Duan, Huda, Siraj (Dad - active advocate)
- **Core Focus**: Summer programs, NCWIT application, storytelling revolution
- **Context**: Hot weather affecting energy, school getting hectic

## 🎯 Major Breakthroughs

### Dad's Powerful Intervention (38:34)
> "Sorry to interrupt but main struggle is anxiety. She's hyper local in her school."

- **Revelation**: System rigged despite being best programmer
- **Pattern**: Hackathon abandonment, ideas stolen then left alone
- **Impact**: Transforms surface story to deep narrative
- **Jenny's Response**: Immediately validates and integrates

### Vulnerability Storytelling Revolution
- **Core Principle**: "How much you struggle to get where you are"
- **Jenny's Example**: "Dad came with $200, only girl at meetings" → National Award
- **Formula**: Background + Barrier + Persistence = Compelling
- **Key Quote**: "You want them to FEEL your story not just hear it"

### Identity Multiplication Strategy
**The Layers**:
1. Muslim (most underrepresented)
2. Woman in CS
3. Bay Area paradox
4. New student (COVID move)
5. Isolated even among girls

**Unique Angle**: "Girls unmotivated while guys create clubs" - isolation within supposed support group

### Scholarship as Award Reframe
- **Brian Cameron**: Only 20 students nationally
- **Coolidge**: Full ride as prestige marker
- **Mindset Shift**: Not about money but recognition
- **Strategy**: Most competitive = most valuable for profile
