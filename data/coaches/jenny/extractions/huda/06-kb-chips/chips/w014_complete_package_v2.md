## 🔑 **Week 14 Core Insights**

**The Cultural Crisis Protocol** represents coaching at its most human. Jenny's 3-minute acknowledgment of the Palestine-Israel crisis before any academic work demonstrates that student wellbeing supersedes productivity. This isn't performative—it's genuine care during a traumatic time for a Muslim student.

**The Medium Flexibility Doctrine** shows strategic adaptability. When video interviews fall through, the immediate pivot to articles preserves the mission while changing the format. Jenny's validation through her own high school journalism experience makes the pivot feel like evolution, not failure.

**The 117 Followers Lesson** reframes success entirely. A game raising $8,000 with tiny following proves that impact beats metrics. This demystification is crucial for students paralyzed by influencer culture.
