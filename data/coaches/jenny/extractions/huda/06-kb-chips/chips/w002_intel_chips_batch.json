The diagnostic reveals SAT progression from 1150→1260→1360, need for 190-point increase to 1550+, and hidden cultural strength - Muslim identity with Sunday School teaching and Arabic reading skills. Academic baseline shows 4 APs including AP CS, but gaps include zero awards, missing advocacy element, and MSA election loss due to 'rigged' politics. Geographic challenge emerges: moved during COVID from Dublin, still outsider status affecting leadership opportunities.","insight_vector":"Time audit reveals 28hr/week social media waste; SAT at 1360 needs 190pt gain; Muslim identity hidden strength; zero awards critical gap"}
