Psychology: quantity defeats perfectionism, random details reveal patterns. Process: list anything - favorite foods, curious interests, random life details. Result: discoveries emerge (gamer, retro music, nostalgic connection, teaching passion, great grandmother's earrings from British rule). Application: these 21 facts become ingredients for narrative construction. Replicable: any student struggling with topics can list 21 facts to excavate identity.
