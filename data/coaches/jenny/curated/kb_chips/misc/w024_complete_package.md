## 🧠 Critical Intelligence Patterns

### 1. The Prescription Protocol 💊
**Discovery:** When parent requests directive guidance, Jenny shifts from exploratory to prescriptive mode
- **Quote:** "we need to be more prescriptive" → "Yeah, I would agree with that"
- **Example:** "I don't think film school is a good fit for you. I think you will be wasting your talent"
- **Impact:** Clear eliminations prevent wasted effort and enable focused pursuit

### 2. Major-First Philosophy 🎓
**Discovery:** Program quality trumps school prestige
- **Evidence:** Stanford deprioritized despite being "dream school"
- **Quote:** "Stanford the program itself doesn't speak to me"
- **Outcome:** UCI's game design program ranked above Stanford

### 3. Geographic Arbitrage 📍
**Discovery:** Location as opportunity multiplier
- **California Advantage:** In-state tuition + admission preference
- **Industry Proximity:** Riot Games, Blizzard, Disney, EA all in SoCal
- **Quote:** "being in California... you'll get more opportunities"

### 4. Triple Confirmation Pattern ✅✅✅
**Discovery:** Student shares → Parent validates → Jenny confirms
- **Example:** Major-driven recognition sequence
- **Purpose:** Prevents family conflict later
- **Outcome:** Aligned strategy across all parties
