Process: 1) Search similar themed hackathons (AI, education, social impact), 2) Review sponsor lists (Twilio, MongoDB, OpenAI, etc), 3) Research sponsor priorities from company websites, 4) Craft personalized pitch connecting their mission to your event, 5) Cold email sponsor contact or general inquiry, 6) Follow up twice if no response. Result: Student secured $13,000 independently using this method. Psychology: sponsors already support hackathons, easier conversion than cold pitching. Personalization: tie event theme to sponsor's stated values. Proof: real sponsors committed, not theoretical. Replicable: any student can research DevPost and replicate. Parent impact: dad's recognition of capability shift from 'needs help' to 'founder level.'","themes":["sponsorship_method","devpost_research","cold_outreach_success","replicable_process","parent_recognition","founder_capability"],"silver_bullet":true}
