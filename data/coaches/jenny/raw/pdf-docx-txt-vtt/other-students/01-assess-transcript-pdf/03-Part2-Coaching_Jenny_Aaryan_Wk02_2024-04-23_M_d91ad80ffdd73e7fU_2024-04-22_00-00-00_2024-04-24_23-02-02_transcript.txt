1
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.500
Ivylevel: Hi.

2
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.360
Ivylevel: yeah, I think Jenny, unfortunately, is running late

3
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.000
Ivylevel: So.

4
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.510
Shah: Need it for a sec.

5
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.079
Ivylevel: Hi! Hi, Lena! How are you?

6
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.130
Ivylevel: Can you hear me? I think you are on mute.

7
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.420
Shah: Yeah, I'm on mute. I got it.

8
00:00:47.340 --> 00:01:02.809
Ivylevel: Amazing. So yeah, I think I have. Mary with me. Actually, she's my ea. But yeah, Jenny is actually on her way in uber like, you know, she's in Beijing right like. So she's that she's like running 5 min late, so she'll be joining.

9
00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:03.670
Shah: Any minute.

10
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.030
Shah: Okay. No. Worries.

11
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.489
Ivylevel: Absolutely, I think. How are you doing.

12
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.140
Shah: Good, good, good! How are you?

13
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:22.179
Ivylevel: Doing great. Yeah. Sorry. I mean, I know that I had to come back to you. I had to revert to you with those profiles and stuff like that. But you know, I've been like super swarmed and been commuting and traveling. So anyways, we'll we'll discuss more. And

14
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.019
Ivylevel: we've also like identified the best coach you know, for

15
00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:36.449
Ivylevel: Arian, based on the profile, I think. As you can see that, you know, we we've really like worked as a team on the profile, we we really spend a lot of time. This is actually.

16
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.180
Ivylevel: this is a very strategic

17
00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:43.799
Ivylevel: kind of session for us, right? Preparing a game plan. Report and stuff like that, because.

18
00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:48.112
Ivylevel: it's a commitment to to deliver. We are very outcome driven. And

19
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.149
Ivylevel: so I I just wanted I mean, I'm more than happy to share just in the interest of time, so that I'll just like show you

20
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.249
Ivylevel: on how the kind of initial draft. So the goal for this particular session was.

21
00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.089
Ivylevel: You know, initially, we just used to have like a one week session. And you know it's like parents, including Neil Lima as well. And she like, Hey.

22
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:26.089
Ivylevel: actually, you guys, you know, one week was too short and you know, like, when we prepared the game plan for Anushka last year. And she's, you know, you guys actually should be doing it like across 2 weeks, and you know, give us more time to kind of collaborate, because there is a lot of value that in the tab. So we then end up, ex extended it?

23
00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:31.470
Ivylevel: So let me just bring it up. How how are you doing, audience?

24
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.009
Shah: I'm doing good.

25
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.990
Ivylevel: Your school day.

26
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.970
Shah: It was good.

27
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.830
Ivylevel: Just good.

28
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.081
Shah: It was a bit boring.

29
00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:45.369
Ivylevel: It was boring.

30
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.840
Shah: Yeah, little bit.

31
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.449
Shah: It says B. Day is like kind of less.

32
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.969
Shah: Most of his

33
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.949
Shah: main classes are an a day. So it's block scheduling at Valley. So.

34
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.240
Ivylevel: Oh, yeah. Oh, okay.

35
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.400
Ivylevel: So I mean, do you have like your tennis and stuff like that done.

36
00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:06.050
Shah: No, no! The tennis season's over.

37
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:16.090
Ivylevel: Oh, okay, cool. So yeah, I think she's gonna join any minute. But I just wanted to tell you what she'll be discussing today. Really like, based on, you know.

38
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.270
Ivylevel: all the discussion we had last week.

39
00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:20.870
Ivylevel: You do.

40
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.180
Ivylevel: Oh, yeah.

41
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.670
Ivylevel: you there.

42
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.799
Ivylevel: Lena. Okay, I just wanna make sure that you're still in the call. Right?

43
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.069
Shah: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking to somebody. I thought, you're talking to Jenny. Sorry. Yeah, I'm here.

44
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:43.030
Ivylevel: No, no, no, no! I was actually talking to you. So I I I was actually sharing my screen right? I I didn't want to take this off, because I really let Jenny do it, because, you know, it's it's really a teamwork, and she's kind of overseeing all of this.

45
00:03:43.512 --> 00:03:45.990
Ivylevel: But, like, you know, going through

46
00:03:46.328 --> 00:04:07.359
Ivylevel: the kind of last week's session that she, you know, she she led, and then, you know, we shared all the notes. And then we, we have our weekly meeting. And then we work offline on this document. Get more inputs. So like, for example, you know, like tennis. As an example like, you know, we would have one of the coaches would actually make a comment and say, You know, that's fine. But you know there are some considerations like, should he be really pursuing tennis?

47
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.930
Ivylevel: So there are like multiple views. But so I would say that this is still not finalized right. We have time selected a lot of inputs.

48
00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:21.399
Ivylevel: Of course, I've actually accepted lot of the comments in the document. But we have highlighted and incorporated

49
00:04:21.732 --> 00:04:26.810
Ivylevel: but the idea is to really co-create this with the student himself. That's very important, right? And parents

50
00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:36.706
Ivylevel: so that we can. After this particular session, you know, and more question. Follow up questions. You can, of course. We'll be able to further kind of finalize it.

51
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.803
Ivylevel: then, you know, like it's still very collective, right? So it's like, initi, and based on the

52
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:54.449
Ivylevel: To be honest, like, you know, a profile that based on the initial assessment, we would say, Okay, what could potentially be like a good kind of an Iv level profile. And when I mean by Iv level profile

53
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.200
Ivylevel: it's really about, you know, top school profiles.

54
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.129
Ivylevel: And what the team actually came up with is really a Cs plus business

55
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.189
Ivylevel: and some cyber security. Of course, the passion areas that

56
00:05:08.924 --> 00:05:25.979
Ivylevel: you know, Arian is very, you know, keen on. He was keen on. We are really looking at that. And that's the kind of coach we would actually have like respond, like, you know, business coaches. And then, you know, Cs coaches and people who have done cyber security projects in there. Kind of, you know. That's why the collective kind of effort

57
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:41.150
Ivylevel: so weak sports TV sports identified again, you know, we know. And again, like again, when I say weak sports again, don't don't get it that way. I think what we are doing is mainly from the perspective of the college admission outcomes that we want where you can really like land and drive.

58
00:05:41.618 --> 00:06:05.060
Ivylevel: And we're saying, Okay, if we start working backwards, say, like 4 years down the road. These are the things if you, your profile is as of today. These are challenges, you'll face right number one. We need to show that tenure and depth right? That's very important. I think that is where there's no harm in having an kind of an open profile and pursuing multiple paths. However, when you stand up against.

59
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.309
Ivylevel: you know, people who are really passionate about business and cyber security, or you know, Cs.

60
00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:27.279
Ivylevel: the place where eventually that you might lack is like, you know, just the tenure in depth. You know, we have, like middle schoolers who are actually doing research and all that stuff. Unfortunately, that's how it it works. So that's one so figuring it out. And I think this is where, like, you know, if we say, Hey, let's

61
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:39.499
Ivylevel: let's figure out, you know. Let's try to blend these 3 things and come up with a few kind of number one. It's gonna be a mix of multiple tools, awards. Competitions are one. But I think really, today, what really stands out

62
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.749
Ivylevel: fundament just a minute. Let's text it. So what really stands out are.

63
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:53.069
Ivylevel: okay, yeah, she's still stuck. I mean, anyways, I I think I can. I can type of you know, because we've got all the data here, and then she can always come in

64
00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:58.780
Ivylevel: apologies for that. It's china traffic. Sorry beijing so.

65
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:13.530
Ivylevel: yeah. So I think I'll I'll come. I I'm I'm kind of presenting to you like a very I would say. Still, even though we have hand picked a few kind of areas we want to target. But these are still, I would say, cookie cutter in some ways, right? Because they're very popular

66
00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:26.370
Ivylevel: popular in the sense like when we go after a particular scholarship or a particular award. You know, we try to see, how can we optimize for better outcomes? Can is it easy? Right? You know, for this particular profile?

67
00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:34.230
Ivylevel: You know, based on the particular kind of gender race things like that. Right? Everything has to be factored. And we say, Okay, these are the things that will add up.

68
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:40.490
Ivylevel: Now, of course, academics is critically important, especially if you are looking at you know, stem subjects

69
00:07:41.198 --> 00:07:43.429
Ivylevel: and it's, I think.

70
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.320
Ivylevel: to be honest, right? It's really

71
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.440
Ivylevel: the Junior year grades are very important, mainly because, you know.

72
00:07:51.750 --> 00:08:07.469
Ivylevel: and and most of our students have. Even the Admins actually might have had some B's, even C's. For example, it's really the trajectory that you want to show at the end of the day. So we still have chance to kind of, you know. Take the trajectory to an upper direction, and making sure you're able to maintain that early on

73
00:08:07.798 --> 00:08:12.109
Ivylevel: community involvement. Absolutely right? So I think this is where, fundamentally, I'll say that

74
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:20.339
Ivylevel: lot of the kind of Asian students typically Indian students. I think we there's this kind of lack where we are not able to scale the impact.

75
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:46.079
Ivylevel: And one way to think about it is, how can we combine Cs with social good as one of the examples? Right? And I know that you're doing the suication and all that. But you know you'll have to figure out something which is different and unique to, to to stand stand out from their perspective. I think tennis engagement again, I think it's a debatable contact topic. I think we debated internally in our team meeting, like, you know, is it really necessary? I mean, and they were like athletes as well in our in our team. So again, the goal is

76
00:08:46.080 --> 00:09:03.240
Ivylevel: again purely from the perspective of working backwards and seeing, like, you know, if you're able to really get to some top levels. Either you demonstrate your leadership or you demonstrate your athlete skills it's it's worth. Otherwise, you know, might be you're better off actually spending more time on something else again. No one's stopping you from playing. You should be doing it.

77
00:09:03.739 --> 00:09:09.890
Ivylevel: And again, I'm all saying this under under Jenny's command, you know she's still like the head coach and specialist here, but

78
00:09:10.645 --> 00:09:14.170
Ivylevel: You know, and and she'll come and probably override if if there are few things

79
00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:17.159
Ivylevel: again, like, you know, clubs involvement is great.

80
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:29.590
Ivylevel: right? And like again, not viewing it as a checklist. If we were to pick up a few clubs. I think the strong recommendation is to really start your own club. That's period that actually has not a valued

81
00:09:29.848 --> 00:09:37.061
Ivylevel: either internally at school, or you might even like, go outside and start where you can have a bigger impact. And it's possible. See, you're still just a freshman.

82
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.970
Shah: For that.

83
00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:39.907
Ivylevel: I think she just joined

84
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.570
Ivylevel: wait a minute.

85
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.580
Ivylevel: Where do I? Oh, it's here.

86
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.410
Ivylevel: okay, Cliff.

87
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.690
Ivylevel: So yeah, let me just complete this. And

88
00:10:01.505 --> 00:10:03.029
Ivylevel: yeah, Jenny, are you there

89
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:18.889
Ivylevel: cautious to join? No worries. So yeah, I think that's one thing. So it's very detailed to find key areas where we need to be concerned. And clearly, like, you know, having a niche area is very important. And we did. You know, a bit of like brainstorming. And these are just like some ideas to be honest, like

90
00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:34.170
Ivylevel: in in our kind of execution program. Really, when you say execution it's mostly about, you know, really framing, just defining a a kind of a unique passion project that uniquely aligns. And it's very different

91
00:10:34.515 --> 00:10:54.009
Ivylevel: takes time. You know, it takes multiple weeks, you know, just that brainstorming just like writing an essay as an example. Right? So some initial ideas were like, Hey, you know, might be you're very particular about tennis, and might be, you know. Let's try to apply. There's some Cs skills like, you know, computer vision or AI like, let's track some tennis movement.

92
00:10:54.010 --> 00:11:05.070
Ivylevel: you know, to a analyze the performance. You know some predictions, you know. I I think you have to think different is what exactly right, but it also has to be very hyper, personal.

93
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:25.369
Ivylevel: And I think this is where you know it. It. I spend a lot of time in telling like, you know, my parents ask me like, Hey, why does like? I understand? You know a a tutor can help my son basically, or my daughter get like, you know, boost the score or a sat. I'm ready to send my kids to like a year of Satan, because, you know, it's very quantifiable.

94
00:11:25.702 --> 00:11:35.380
Ivylevel: But thing but really is this is the kind of thing that takes time. And it's an iterative process, right? I mean, today, this might be refined into something absolutely different.

95
00:11:36.084 --> 00:11:41.610
Ivylevel: Jenny, are you? Oh, she's actually trying to join, I think. Yeah, anyway. So

96
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.570
Jenny Duan: Hi, okay.

97
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.360
Ivylevel: Sorry.

98
00:11:45.360 --> 00:12:07.690
Jenny Duan: Much for your patience. Well, I just wanna sincerely apologize for being late today. I'm starting abroad today. My class is going on a field trip, so my uber was very late. But I'm very sorry for being late. I'm happy to make make up another 15 min like the rest. At the end of this week or next week. Again completely my fault. I had a mix up with my uber, but thank you so much for your patience, and I'm happy to make up the 15 min. Another time.

99
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.260
Shah: Sure, sure.

100
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:21.860
Ivylevel: Okay. So I I was just trying no worries, you know. I think, th, there is a lot of empathy because you're a student, too, and and thanks a lot for accommodating, and I try. I'm trying to fill in your shoes. I don't know if I'm doing a good job, but I just wanted to complete this and hand it over to you

101
00:12:22.127 --> 00:12:26.580
Ivylevel: so quickly. I was just going through all the kind of week the main week. Sports

102
00:12:26.974 --> 00:12:41.170
Ivylevel: in terms of you know the profile like first trying to like commit to a particular intended major. I think we've identified the profile to be more like a Cs and business plus cyber security intergovernment.

103
00:12:41.464 --> 00:12:41.760
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

104
00:12:42.485 --> 00:12:43.210
Shah: Profile.

105
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:57.149
Ivylevel: And then talking, we were talking about the community project that you know. Rishi had actually proposed. When Rishi and Jana were discussing on how we can actually combine the Cs skills with, you know his interest and passions on tennis.

106
00:12:57.505 --> 00:13:12.560
Ivylevel: you know, combining like AI and vision to kind of track the performance as an example. And I was just telling, explaining, you know, how these things actually take time. And you can actually share your experiences with Anushka as an example. Right? You know. How did we go about framing her game plan and her passion project?

107
00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:30.089
Ivylevel: And these are really the eventually the standouts. Are these things right? They are the big ticket items. They take time. And and you know, in fact, there are coaches in our team who have literally you know, the reason they got in was not because of awards or scholarships was for these kind of community impact and projects that they've done.

108
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:45.309
Ivylevel: That's one. So just to kind of yeah. And I, I think this, it's really lot of detail things here, like, you know what's the the point of view, and we will give you a final report. These are again like, very collected different point of views.

109
00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:57.089
Ivylevel: You know certain like, you know, should pursuing a club be the right approach might be not starting your own club. These are the strategies where, you know, you're working on a weekly basis. And we tried to figure out, how do you go about it?

110
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.460
Ivylevel: And you know, really.

111
00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:16.830
Ivylevel: setting up something that will actually force you to also develop those skills. Right? You have something. Now, you want to make an impact. Starting with the Y, that is where we want to really focus on that takes time once. Your why is very clear, then I think you will enjoy it like, why do you want to learn cyber security because you want to bring an impact right?

112
00:14:17.145 --> 00:14:37.969
Ivylevel: And I think it's really very detailed here. Multiple kind of you know, very handpicked kind of pro competitions, we wanna target which are easy to win, but also have like a global reputation. So we are trying to maximize the impact and outcome, but also like one of the things in Passion Project, is like, you know, let's go and just start a business

113
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:46.920
Ivylevel: right? And when we're talking about. This is the multiple ideas we are talking about here. To also demonstrate the see teaching cyber security classes

114
00:14:47.336 --> 00:14:51.970
Ivylevel: to, you know, imprison youth in Oakland detention set, you know, centers

115
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:57.870
Ivylevel: right? So I mean thinking something which is really like unique, very niche, and also has an impact.

116
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:17.849
Ivylevel: So that is, that is what actually takes time, and again and and then eventually, like, if you think about as I told you when we we spoke earlier, like what we have also seen of our kind of synthesis synthesizing 500 plus students, you know, interviews that we've done. Eventually it boils down to these 3 things, and that is our approach. I think people have different approaches.

117
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:37.000
Ivylevel: It all boils down to first being able to demonstrate your aptitude. So cyber security. We have identified some very specific goals. So you know, this is all the brainstorming at the end of the day kind of distilling into some very concrete goals and okay, ours. And we're saying, Okay, you know, starting a sec Cyber Security Club, right? Whether it's school or whether, be it external.

118
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:52.979
Ivylevel: And then, you know. Then, you know, basically trying to. Also, there's a research path, right? We we are gonna explore a few things. And I think iteratively, your coach is basically gonna tell you that 80 20. Okay, let's not do everything. Let's pick 2, 3 things based on your interest.

119
00:15:53.278 --> 00:16:01.059
Ivylevel: This is very, very important. Your niche passion. We have given 4 or 5 ideas already, but maybe that's not the one just to kind of trigger that process.

120
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.649
Ivylevel: Then also, entrepreneurship is important. Right? So you kind of. So that's why starting a business

121
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:20.149
Ivylevel: with a community impact, but also being able to do cyber security, you see how it's woven. Now, now, suddenly, you're kind of becoming an entrepreneur, but you're also giving a cyber security impact to us social community that takes time. Sorry.

122
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:27.280
Ivylevel: I think there are. There's a lot of here a lot of things here. So I think, Jenny, since we've already gone through this.

123
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:44.229
Ivylevel: I'm more than happy to go to any particular area that you want to. Because I know that you have many other. Follow up questions to further understand the profile, and and and you know we'll take it from there. I just wanted to kind of in the interest of time. I didn't want to like kind of you to repeat it so. But it's all away over over to you now. Yeah.

124
00:16:48.120 --> 00:17:11.289
Jenny Duan: Alright great. So I think so much has covered a lot in terms of just going over the recommendations and the game plan report which we spend a lot of time personalizing for our end based on his interest and his skill set. So I just wanna start off and see if you have any broad questions that we can address today to frame our conversation. If not, I wanna spend some time digging into that business and tech interest and finding something more specific within that.

125
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:23.839
Shah: Any questions when I'm school and stuff like that. He was not able to take intro to entrepreneur or not intro entrepreneurship cause I think they give preference to like juniors and seniors for that

126
00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:33.410
Shah: and there probably a lot of people wanted it. So he was not. And then this year. They're not letting freshmen or sophomores take physics, either.

127
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.309
Shah: So we're trying to figure out that eighth class for him.

128
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:45.420
Shah: so that's the main thing that we're kind of doing right now, because schools about to end right? So he's getting ready for Ap's and finals and all that. So.

129
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.629
Jenny Duan: Completely. Yeah. And

130
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:58.109
Jenny Duan: course, planning is definitely something that we spend a lot of time focusing on, and that we think is really important. So beyond course planning. Are there any other areas of concern that you want to spend extra time emphasizing today.

131
00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:01.505
Shah: Maybe some are planning a little.

132
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:13.550
Jenny Duan: Great. Yeah, those are all really good options. So we can start off with that eighth course. So we know that you're interested in entrepreneurship, but that's only offered to juniors and seniors historically. Have there been any sophomores taking the course.

133
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.930
Shah: Yeah.

134
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:26.009
Shah: yeah, I think they've gotten more strict this year about certain courses, because they're so popular that they're just giving more preference to juniors and seniors, you know, like physics and other some other classes as well. So.

135
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.859
Jenny Duan: Right? I think it actually begs the question like, Do you actually need a course to learn entrepreneurship or.

136
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.550
Shah: Yeah, and you can.

137
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:37.129
Jenny Duan: By starting your own business or doing your own venture, or participating in some other type of activity.

138
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:43.130
Jenny Duan: So let's put a pause on that. And maybe we can table that for summer, because I think summer is a really good time

139
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.259
Jenny Duan: to practice entrepreneurship and to potentially

140
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.600
Jenny Duan: start a

141
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.032
Jenny Duan: project in that realm.

142
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.450
Shah: Sorry, Jenny, you're cutting out. I don't know.

143
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.679
Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry I said. What other questions are you considering beyond entrepreneurship?

144
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.149
Shah: Ap. Stats. And then, besides that, I I don't know.

145
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.750
Shah: Yeah. The only thing.

146
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.330
Jenny Duan: Hello!

147
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:40.890
Shah: Sorry. So the yeah, the other the Ap. Stats. But Eric has counselors being a little difficult. So I'm gonna have to talk to them to see if he can take that otherwise he has like one. So Valley is kind of weird. So they offer 7 classes as a year, and then one extra class that you have to like pay for extra. So I don't know how colleges look on that, you know, if he doesn't take it. If he takes an open period. I'm not really sure, because really they only have 7 classes and the eighth class you always have to pay for

148
00:19:42.390 --> 00:20:08.789
Jenny Duan: I think it's it's probably not a big deal whether or not you do the eighth class. I think if there's an eighth class that fits into your interest and schedule. That's fine. But if you do have to pay for an extra class, I don't think if it's not gonna benefit your Gpa, or if it's not, gonna have a significant interest for you, then I think it's probably not worth it because of the time I think everything that you do in portion for college is all about the time trade off, and so maybe that time would be better invested into something else.

149
00:20:11.663 --> 00:20:16.800
Jenny Duan: Are you looking to fill that slot, Arian? Do you want to take another class, or are you just exploring that possibility?

150
00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:20.939
Shah: I do. I do want to take another honor ap plus

151
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.830
Shah: for my eighth class.

152
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.439
Jenny Duan: Yeah, may I ask why you wanted to take that other class.

153
00:20:27.785 --> 00:20:30.630
Shah: Well, if I was gonna take Ap. Stats.

154
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.710
Shah: then a senior year, I could take advanced data analysis.

155
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.950
Shah: So

156
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.799
Shah: that's one of the reasons. I want to take stats.

157
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.800
Jenny Duan: That seems like a really good reason to take stats. What's stopping you from signing up.

158
00:20:45.915 --> 00:20:48.190
Shah: You have to apply for it. So

159
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.800
Shah: I'm not. I'm just not sure if I'll.

160
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.270
Jenny Duan: What does that application look like, and how many people are admitted.

161
00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:02.280
Shah: it's just it's a Google form asking you about your grades. What classes you're taking?

162
00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:13.890
Shah: It's for doubling up in math. Basically, not really an application to get in necessarily, but just doubling in doubling up in math, because he's already taken calk piece BC. So.

163
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:23.720
Jenny Duan: Got it? Yeah. And do you feel like that will be a good enough workload for you? Do you feel like that will be overwhelming, or do you think you'll be able to do well in stats.

164
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.509
Shah: I think that'll be like fine.

165
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:39.210
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. Then I would encourage you to sign up. I think that seems like a really good fit for you. I think it'll prep you for the advanced data structures, data, science classes that you wanted to take. So I think you should definitely submit an application for that

166
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.250
Jenny Duan: quote.

167
00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.570
Jenny Duan: And I think

168
00:21:43.710 --> 00:22:02.790
Jenny Duan: now, moving on to the summer, I know that entrepreneurship is sort of this area that you're interested in. I'm curious what in your vision like on what does entrepreneurship look like for you? Is that technology entrepreneurship? Or is that learning business skills? Is that more finance? What aspect of entrepreneurship are you interested in.

169
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.329
Shah: It's like learning how to start a business.

170
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.540
Jenny Duan: Yeah, what kind of business will you start?

171
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.309
Shah: Hmm! I I don't know yet

172
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.989
Shah: just any type of business.

173
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.138
Jenny Duan: Okay, do you want to

174
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.429
Jenny Duan: make money? Do you want to

175
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:27.999
Jenny Duan: like learn a specific skill set? Do you want to? What? What do you want out of your business.

176
00:22:28.977 --> 00:22:30.529
Shah: To make money and

177
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.130
Shah: just to learn how to start. Well, learn how to

178
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.609
Shah: yeah. Start a business.

179
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.339
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So I think with business, there's a couple of different strategies you could go from.

180
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:53.860
Jenny Duan: So first of all, there's the operation side. Right? There's the being able to hire, to scale, to connect with other people. There's the financial aspect of the business, right? Managing your books, making sure if you're

181
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.750
Jenny Duan: or, you know, trying to

182
00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:13.299
Jenny Duan: to raise money if you're trying to earn money making sure that you know your profits are, have good margins. There's the marketing aspect, which is, I think, super important nowadays, like learning how to use social media, how to do copywriting, to how to advertise your products. And then there's the sales perspective how to actually sell your products. So

183
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:22.649
Jenny Duan: normally, people in business, I would say they either take, I mean, if you're a startup owner. Maybe you do all these roles, but there's usually like business operation sales marketing like.

184
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:34.550
Jenny Duan: And then, like whoever's building the business. For example, if it's a tech business like there's there needs to be an engineer or someone on the team. So what type of like industry would you want your business in? Do you know.

185
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.339
Shah: Oh, he has been.

186
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:43.799
Jenny Duan: Just can make thing like even high school businesses can range from anything to a fully funded like what I call Major startup to

187
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:48.470
Jenny Duan: reselling shoes on Instagram, and both maybe, could be equally profitable.

188
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:54.089
Jenny Duan: It profits your goal right? So what type of business are you looking to build? Maybe we can spend some time thinking about this.

189
00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.890
Shah: Well, right now in high school, I wanna make a business for Valley Christian or my school.

190
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.569
Shah: So something to do or something that they need.

191
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.219
Shah: That's what I want to. What I would do.

192
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:16.229
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. So something specifically for Valley Christian, I think this would be a great idea and something you could do over the summer. I think that building a business

193
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:29.539
Jenny Duan: just the summer is not only good learning, but it's also like good experience for you personally, professionally. So let's think about? What are some of the needs of your students like at lunch? What do you hear your fellow peers talking about? What do you think is something that your friends would need.

194
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.320
Shah: But

195
00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.849
Shah: I haven't really thought about it much.

196
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.630
Jenny Duan: That's okay.

197
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.340
Shah: Right right now. I don't like I don't really see anything, but

198
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:47.080
Shah: maybe if I try to think of something later on, I could find something.

199
00:24:47.080 --> 00:25:07.070
Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do the brainstorming now, because I think if we want to prep for your summer like, it's already, it's already May. So basically, we're building your business. Starting. Now, let's maybe work through some thinking strategies to see like what kinds of peer, what kinds of struggles your peers experience. So you know, you want to do something that helps people at Valley Christian. What

200
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:13.680
Jenny Duan: like, when when people run for Asb office or software class president or junior class president. What do they say? They're trying to fix.

201
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.629
Shah: They say they're trying to fix like

202
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.009
Shah: lunch lines.

203
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.320
Shah: like certain school events, they try. And host.

204
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.180
Shah: yeah.

205
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:36.369
Shah: we don't really run a lot of elections like publicly. I don't. I don't even know about many of them.

206
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:43.569
Jenny Duan: Okay, maybe you should look into how this the selection process works, not only because I think.

207
00:25:43.630 --> 00:26:01.969
Jenny Duan: understanding what kinds of issues your elected officials at school are fighting for can help. You also understand what problems you need to solve. But also, I think you'd be a good candidate for student government or student leadership one day, and I feel like, because I think you would be a good leader at your school. You should learn about the process in case you need to go through in the future.

208
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.750
Jenny Duan: But do you feel like wedge lights are a big problem.

209
00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:14.130
Shah: It just it just takes a long time to get food. There's only one lunch line, or there's 2. But yeah, it just takes a long time.

210
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.590
Jenny Duan: How does that affect students? Do you think.

211
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.440
Shah: It just makes

212
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.059
Shah: like it takes a long time. It wastes time. If you need to do something

213
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.740
Shah: or like they're unable to eat the time.

214
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.940
Jenny Duan: Click on average.

215
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.670
Shah: 10 min! 15 min!

216
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.380
Jenny Duan: And how long is your total lunch period.

217
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.450
Shah: 35, or sometimes 40 min.

218
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.840
Jenny Duan: Okay. So it's taking anywhere from like

219
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.270
Jenny Duan: almost

220
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.720
Jenny Duan: a third, like

221
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:54.729
Jenny Duan: almost a half, like, maybe around 40% of students' time. That's a lot of time.

222
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.860
Jenny Duan: How did

223
00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:06.389
Jenny Duan: how do students normally like? Do they just wait in line? Do people rush to the front like, what? Tell me, can you walk me through what happens on a normal lunch day.

224
00:27:07.611 --> 00:27:09.579
Shah: So some some teachers

225
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.870
Shah: let students out a minute early

226
00:27:12.582 --> 00:27:16.649
Shah: so if you like, if you get dismissed, nor like at where normal time

227
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.480
Shah: there's going to be a huge line.

228
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.820
Shah: So.

229
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:36.729
Jenny Duan: In your opinion. What do you think causes the build up? Do you think it's because people spend too long like trying to pick what they want. Do you feel like, you know, people are too slow handing out things. Those are some possible explanations. What do you feel like causes? The long line.

230
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:46.219
Shah: There's not enough lunch lines that people serving are kind of slow. There's just like a lot of people there.

231
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.580
Jenny Duan: How would you solve this problem.

232
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.320
Shah: I'd like

233
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.969
Shah: dismiss some classes early, some later.

234
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.400
Shah: or just

235
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.170
Shah: making you lunch lined.

236
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:17.399
Jenny Duan: Okay, do you think this is a problem that you would like to solve with business.

237
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:24.880
Shah: Maybe. But I think it's it's kind of hard to solve. Maybe have an app to pre order. Yeah, like, you can.

238
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.690
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

239
00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:31.599
Jenny Duan: do people go off campus for lunch at all? Or do they? Does everyone have to stay on campus.

240
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.830
Shah: Everyone has to stay on campus.

241
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.820
Jenny Duan: Can they like? I'm curious, can people? Does. Does anyone ever Doordash to school?

242
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.909
Jenny Duan: I don't know if that's too like.

243
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:46.620
Shah: Not for lunch. Usually it's for like, after I know my daughter does like for after school things

244
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.748
Shah: I don't know if they're allowed to during lunch. Yeah.

245
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.240
Jenny Duan: Are they allowed to join a munch like.

246
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.240
Jenny Duan: for example, if you found a way to.

247
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.140
Jenny Duan: maybe

248
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.429
Jenny Duan: the bring in meals from other places, would they be able.

249
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.869
Shah: I think they I think they would.

250
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.435
Shah: I just don't know anyone that does it.

251
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.512
Shah: Their school is on like this hill.

252
00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.450
Jenny Duan: What if you made a business that connected like?

253
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.809
Jenny Duan: Go ahead! Sorry, interrupted you.

254
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:26.940
Shah: Sorry you're kinda you're it's kind of going out. But no what I was saying. There, there canvas is also on this hill, and like just logistically, is just difficult, you know.

255
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.987
Shah: for that kind of thing. I feel like on campus. They're very. They're very security, heavy and very, you know.

256
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:42.140
Shah: kind of campus. It's definitely not like a you can walk down even without a little pass or something, you know, so they're pretty strict about things.

257
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:56.750
Jenny Duan: That makes sense. Yeah, I was thinking, it could be interesting for you to partner with like local family on restaurants or something to do like a catering, maybe like 50 lunches every day, and just you could get that approved by the school, maybe, and

258
00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:15.730
Jenny Duan: have people like order from there, and that could maybe solve the issue. But if that's I don't know about the feasibility of that. Given your schools on a hill, but I think like that could be an option for you to work with a partner with different restaurants that might need the business, and that you would be able to bring in like you would able, you would be able to solve this lunch problem with.

259
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:26.687
Shah: That'd be a bad idea like those little to go little boxes per restaurant if they just bring like 50 or something a day a day, or every other day, or.

260
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:28.400
Jenny Duan: Mary, David.

261
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.009
Shah: That's sometimes right? Your school.

262
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.356
Shah: Yeah, yeah.

263
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:42.879
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm curious, like, what specifically about solving a problem at your school stands out to you like, why is it important that you saw something at your school versus outside school.

264
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:48.089
Shah: It's easier to solve school problems, I think, than outside.

265
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.834
Shah: I don't think why. Knows where to downside, you know, like.

266
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.930
Jenny Duan: We're at. Yeah.

267
00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.790
Jenny Duan: maybe we could just think about like, what kinds of

268
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.380
Jenny Duan: businesses would you want to start like just for fun?

269
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:07.350
Jenny Duan: Is there anything like? Maybe you don't need a direct problem. Is there anything you just want to build just for the sake of building it.

270
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.359
Shah: Something to do with space. Maybe.

271
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:20.870
Jenny Duan: Okay, wait. Tell me more about this interest in space. I feel like I haven't heard you speak about this before. What are you interested in in space. And how'd you get interested in it?

272
00:31:22.197 --> 00:31:24.749
Shah: Just watching videos, just

273
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.260
Shah: like about space. I guess.

274
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.029
Shah: Black holes. Yeah.

275
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.467
Shah: he was obsessed with black holes for a while.

276
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:40.279
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's that's actually super interesting. Are you interested with the physics of space.

277
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.670
Jenny Duan: or like space travel? Or what aspect of that.

278
00:31:46.827 --> 00:31:48.439
Shah: Just like how.

279
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.988
Shah: how some things work, and how

280
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.569
Shah: It's like, how it's not possible to do some things.

281
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.280
Jenny Duan: Do you like? What?

282
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.000
Jenny Duan: Watching? Side by moving.

283
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.450
Ivylevel: Hi, Jenny!

284
00:32:30.097 --> 00:32:33.700
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe something s- someone right in the d-.

285
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.080
Ivylevel: Yeah.

286
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:34.970
Jenny Duan: Or something.

287
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.829
Ivylevel: Yeah, I think they're back. Yeah.

288
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.930
Shah: Back.

289
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.370
Jenny Duan: Okay, Hi, welcome back.

290
00:32:45.958 --> 00:32:52.311
Jenny Duan: Cool. I'm curious. Like, if you if you like, watching sci-fi movies or

291
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.579
Jenny Duan: like, what? When did you get education, password?

292
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.520
Shah: I remember like watching interstellar a while ago

293
00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.989
Shah: like that come interested in space.

294
00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:11.770
Shah: It's real.

295
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.060
Shah: Hello.

296
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.090
Shah: yeah.

297
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.530
Jenny Duan: Awesome.

298
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.360
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

299
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.720
Ivylevel: Okay.

300
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.809
Jenny Duan: Sellers one of the best movies ever. I think that

301
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.820
Jenny Duan: doing something.

302
00:33:26.147 --> 00:33:27.130
Ivylevel: They were back.

303
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.499
Ivylevel: Yeah, I think, Jenny, of.

304
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:37.330
Ivylevel: Yeah, I think breaking Jenny, do you wanna turn off your video like, if you know, that's not an issue. Yeah.

305
00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:41.790
Jenny Duan: Is this anything better if I turn off my video.

306
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.780
Ivylevel: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it's better.

307
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.152
Jenny Duan: Okay, I think maybe VPN issues today.

308
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:56.830
Jenny Duan: okay, so with interstellar, I think, like, that's a really interesting thing. And I think there's a lot you could do with that. So

309
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.469
Jenny Duan: with with your space startup or space business, what?

310
00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:13.349
Jenny Duan: How do you feel like you could address this problem? Because I mean, I think space is very broad, and there's lots of ways to to tackle it. But like as a student who wants to start a business like, what area of the space problem do you want to solve.

311
00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:21.409
Shah: I don't think there's anything I could solve, but maybe something like

312
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.670
Shah: like a visual simulation of space

313
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.170
Shah: that people could use something like that.

314
00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:38.419
Jenny Duan: That's super cool. And that also combines your interest in computer science and technology. Actually, I know that in your area, I think there's actually a space museum.

315
00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:40.609
Jenny Duan: Have you heard about this.

316
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.240
Shah: I don't. I don't think I have.

317
00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:54.989
Jenny Duan: Let me just verify really quickly. But yeah, the NASA Ames Research Center is in San Jose. Have you ever been there.

318
00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.089
Shah: No, I haven't.

319
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:10.359
Jenny Duan: Okay, it's like a fake space station, I think. First of all, you should definitely visit here. But second of all, like, are you interested in physics, too, or just mostly like just arrow aerospace, or

320
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:15.449
Jenny Duan: at just space as a subject. Or do you like physics as well? Because I think there's a lot you could do in this area.

321
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.759
Shah: I I'm interested in. I think I'm interested in both physics and space.

322
00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:36.969
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So this is actually a really good dish, I think to take take advantage of this interesting space, because I think one of the things that I was struggling to narrow down in your profile is within tech and business. I feel like that's a very general subject. But going into something deep, like

323
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:55.019
Jenny Duan: astrophysics, space, science, or even cyber security will help you refine your profile and distinguish yourself even more from all of these cookie cutter profiles, which is a theme that we talked about last time. So I'm curious, like out of space and cyber security. Do you have a preference towards either one of them, or do you like both.

324
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.489
Shah: Probably space, more.

325
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:06.889
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I'm curious, like, what started your passion for cyber security in the first place, or what's what? Got you interested in cyber security?

326
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.569
Shah: Oh, my dad worked in cyber security. So

327
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.487
Shah: that's pretty much it.

328
00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.100
Shah: not on the niche, but.

329
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.180
Jenny Duan: And anything related to cyber security.

330
00:36:18.555 --> 00:36:21.670
Shah: I did a club and first semester

331
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.889
Shah: the school year, but

332
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.710
Shah: no, nothing besides that.

333
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:35.149
Shah: it was a very new club, so they didn't really do much, and he gets very bored easily. So it's sometimes it's hard to get his attention into, like.

334
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.330
Shah: you know.

335
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:41.039
Shah: Have them stick with it, you know. So that's I think, one thing that's

336
00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:55.470
Shah: I want him to learn to like a little, delve a little bit deeper into things, so that just give it a chance, because sometimes you don't know in the first 5 min, 10 min, right? You have to kind of keep doing it for a little bit. So I think that's one thing that we probably need to work on. But.

337
00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:06.389
Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah, that's that's a sign of a sharp mind, though. So don't worry about that. I think that'd be really powerful for you to start a cyber patriot club at your school. Have you heard of cyber patriot.

338
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.290
Shah: Written.

339
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.899
Jenny Duan: Okay, so cyber patriot student like high school foot.

340
00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:31.189
Jenny Duan: Okay, cyber security competition. I think we put this on your report as well. But I think cyber patria is a competition that not a lot of people participate in. And it's easy to win awards. And so I actually did. Cyber patriot in high school, too. I I'm not doing cyber security now, but I think cyber patriots really interesting. If you want a hands-on approach to

341
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.990
Jenny Duan: ensuring that like different devices, are secure. So it's everyone

342
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:44.630
Jenny Duan: for patriot you work on. You know the Linux terminal like the unix terminal as well as windows, and you learn how to

343
00:37:44.720 --> 00:38:03.640
Jenny Duan: like, ensure that this terminal is safe through a variety of different measures that you learn. And I think like, if you were able to start a cyber patriot club at your school. That would be a really good opportunity for leadership, and also an opportunity for you to win some awards, because I think that's what area that we also could spend some more time in. So

344
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:16.609
Jenny Duan: first of all, I think that's a really good idea. I don't think that you necessarily need to choose right now between astrophysics or space sites and cyber security. I think you could pursue both at the same time, until you figure out eventually what you want to stick with in the long run.

345
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:24.869
Jenny Duan: And so I think that something that you could do in terms of community service is actually volunteering at the aerospace PC. Of of

346
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:32.520
Jenny Duan: California, which is in Sacramento or at the NASA Abe Center, which is in San Jose. I think that you should

347
00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:42.429
Jenny Duan: first of all just pay these 2 places to visit, because rocket ship, I believe, and the San Jose, and then the aerospace

348
00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:50.459
Jenny Duan: Museum of California is is just the museum focused on aerospace. And so I think both would be really just interesting for you. But also, if you were

349
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:57.120
Jenny Duan: able to take on a couple projects there. Maybe you would be able to build your business idea of creating

350
00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:12.370
Jenny Duan: like simulations of different space objects or different space interactions, and that would set you up potentially for a business internship at NASA or at Boeing, or any company that deals with rockets and outer space. So I think that would be really.

351
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.719
Jenny Duan: What are your thoughts.

352
00:39:15.876 --> 00:39:19.139
Shah: Yeah, I mean getting an internship at NASA would be cool.

353
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.330
Shah: That's something. What I would want to do. Want to do.

354
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.449
Jenny Duan: Yeah, das is one of the very few like like

355
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.539
Jenny Duan: big companies that does high school internships. They have a very robust.

356
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:35.839
Jenny Duan: actually high school Jewish program and a lot of juniors and seniors go into that.

357
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.251
Jenny Duan: So I think that we could well position you before that

358
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:46.829
Jenny Duan: within space. Are you more interested in planets, or like man-made objects, actual objects, or man-made objects.

359
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.360
Shah: More like natural objects.

360
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.510
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Are you interested in doing research at all? Like, would you be interested in researching black holes like physics or Cs research.

361
00:40:05.048 --> 00:40:07.359
Shah: Yeah, like, researching about

362
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.529
Shah: yeah, different things in space.

363
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.439
Jenny Duan: I think.

364
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.420
Shah: Sorry you're still cutting out a little.

365
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.169
Ivylevel: Yeah, I think I think the connection is not great. Then I mean, that's why I asked her to

366
00:40:26.773 --> 00:40:32.836
Ivylevel: turn off the video. I think so far so good. But yeah, I think, the VPN actually.

367
00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:33.820
Jenny Duan: And all

368
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.160
Jenny Duan: hotspot.

369
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.030
Jenny Duan: maybe

370
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:37.900
Jenny Duan: without.

371
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:46.267
Ivylevel: Yeah, you wanna you wanna do that real quick. Because, yeah, it's it's not a bit bad. I think the VPN. Probably doesn't help, you know.

372
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.800
Ivylevel: either.

373
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.380
Ivylevel: yeah. Great

374
00:40:52.170 --> 00:41:07.864
Ivylevel: this this is perfect. And I think that's the beauty that you know how like the the power is really in the the iterative process on how you go about refining, like, you know, we didn't think about Astro as an example like we didn't have NASA in our pipeline. And now I think the more

375
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:23.793
Ivylevel: you know, Arian is opening up, he's basically able to share. And actually, Aaron, I'm very much like you right. I do have Adsd. By the way, I I disclose this with my parents eventually, like, you know, I'm very passion driven, and that's why you know, for like for me to actually work in college. Prep. Are you there, Jenny? Feel free to interrupt me once you're back.

376
00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.167
Jenny Duan: Here I'm I'm

377
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.420
Ivylevel: I can take you, take.

378
00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.820
Jenny Duan: But we'll see if this is any better.

379
00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.189
Ivylevel: This is better, actually, much better. Okay, I'll I'll leave you.

380
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:49.842
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So, yeah, are you interested in doing like, maybe computer science research focused on discovering new extra objects or new patterns and spaces. I think this is one area where people are applying computer science in a pretty important way.

381
00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.919
Shah: I I think I'd wanna do that problem.

382
00:41:53.880 --> 00:42:03.150
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Pivoting. Oh, sorry I keep cutting you off this is pivoting us more in like a physics direction rather than Cs. How do you feel about this.

383
00:42:05.226 --> 00:42:06.519
Shah: I think.

384
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.660
Shah: Well.

385
00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:12.050
Shah: I'm interested in physics, but

386
00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.819
Shah: probably not as much as computer science.

387
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.370
Jenny Duan: Got it. Yeah.

388
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:38.050
Jenny Duan: that makes a lot of sense. So that let's stick with like computer science research rather than physics research. So instead of researching like the movement of black holes, or how how fast things go into it. Maybe we could find you a professor that works on discovering black holes or using computer algorithms to analyze black holes.

389
00:42:38.687 --> 00:42:44.909
Jenny Duan: I think that could also be a really interesting project for the summer. So maybe you could combine like

390
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:51.180
Jenny Duan: space Cs and business by doing research with a professor and developing your own.

391
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.559
Jenny Duan: I don't know, like detection algorithm detection process for black holes with computer science.

392
00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:15.000
Jenny Duan: so that combines, like all 3 of your interest. And I think that would be a really really cool project for the summer. I think that a lot of times people will look at summer programs to help you do research. But you don't necessarily need to do a summer program to actually do research. I think the most easiest way sometimes is just to reach out to professors directly.

393
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:39.199
Jenny Duan: So I think, like on the report when we revise it, to include the details of today's call. I will put in some specific professors that I think you should reach out to in your local area. So maybe at San Jose State at Stanford, at Santa Clara University, at all the schools around here, like you see, Davis, etc, to see if you could work with one of these professors over the summer. I think that would be a really really valuable like 2, 3 month project for you this summer.

394
00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:46.500
Jenny Duan: Would this be something that you would be interested in? Or do you want to explore other ideas as well.

395
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.209
Shah: Yeah, I think I'd want to do this.

396
00:43:51.400 --> 00:44:05.670
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I think this will be really valuable for you. I think that freshman year summer one of the priorities should be to try to figure out what areas you're interested in and what types of work you want to be doing. And so, because fresh in your summer, actually, most colleges don't really

397
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.389
Jenny Duan: care to be honest. What you do in Freshman Year summer. The most important ones are your sophomore summer and your junior summer.

398
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:31.879
Jenny Duan: but fresh, and summer is a good opportunity for you to start new extracurriculars and dive deeper into things that you may be curious about, but maybe don't know that much about, so that the purpose of that would be to cut things starting your sophomore year to say that. Okay, maybe I'm not interested in this, so I don't want to waste more time doing this sophomore year and onwards, and so

399
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.229
Jenny Duan: are there any other topics beyond astrophysics that you might be interested in exploring. To some extent

400
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:44.129
Jenny Duan: it could be anything it could be like, okay, maybe I thought about being a lawyer, and I want to talk about that or

401
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:55.650
Jenny Duan: something else completely different, like, oh, I want to start playing. I don't know the guitar, and I want to explore that. But are there anything else? Is there anything else that you want to explore that? Have it that you haven't had the opportunity to yet?

402
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.809
Shah: No.

403
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.340
Shah: I mean.

404
00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:01.840
Jenny Duan: With that.

405
00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.799
Shah: Interested in sports.

406
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.770
Shah: But yeah.

407
00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:09.010
Shah: yes, like.

408
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.740
Jenny Duan: What about sports interests? You?

409
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.969
Shah: You should say the football stats and all that kind of football like

410
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.409
Shah: like stats, and just and just

411
00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.320
Shah: watching the games.

412
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:35.680
Jenny Duan: Did you know that there's actually a lot of overlap between statistics and sports like a lot of people try to predict games. A lot of people try to use statistics to make bets to, to like, predict who's gonna win like March madness, etc, etc. Have you heard about this at all?

413
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.219
Shah: Yeah, I have, especially for Merch. Madam's.

414
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:47.469
Jenny Duan: Do you like game theory or poker, or like statistics? Being used in real world applications?

415
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.329
Shah: Yeah, I like

416
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.840
Shah: like using statistics to

417
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.919
Shah: and like blackjack, I guess, or poker

418
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:56.940
Shah: to

419
00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.280
Shah: to help human.

420
00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.096
Jenny Duan: That's really cool. Actually, one of my

421
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.343
Jenny Duan: one of my good friends here. She's at Stanford. She's a computer science major. She's also

422
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:23.389
Jenny Duan: She's also runs like a really big rap forum on discord. But she also does predictive analytics for sports, and she's she won our March madness, our Stanford whole Stanford wide March madness, bracket challenge by doing prediction using algorithms for

423
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:41.060
Jenny Duan: bask for college basketball. And I think, like that is a really interesting opportunity for you to combine computer science and sports, too. If you wanted to work on a project and you could have multiple projects in the summer like you don't have to be only doing one thing like you can work on multiple things in the summer. If you wanted to start a project, maybe

424
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:57.650
Jenny Duan: using analytics or learning how to use analytics to to make predictions about a sport, whether that's football, basketball, you know anything else? Would this be something that you'd be interested in, because I think we I could help you find some courses or some opportunities for you to learn this.

425
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.100
Shah: Yeah, yeah, I think I don't want to do that.

426
00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:05.270
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. How? How much programming knowledge do you have right now?

427
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.680
Shah: a little bit. I'm I'm not that good at coding, though.

428
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:11.840
Shah: right now.

429
00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:38.998
Jenny Duan: Okay. So maybe a plan would be to get good at coding this summer so that you're able to start, you know, writing algorithms for sports prediction, or for understanding black holes, or for optimizing your lunch lines or anything else. I think that would also be a good use of your summer. So I think upskilling and discovery should be the theme of your freshman year summer. So what are the skills you need to build to work on the projects that will be impactful for you.

430
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:58.879
Jenny Duan: That's priority. One priority 2 is what areas are you curious about that? You haven't had the opportunity to explore before and priority 3 is what new opportunities can you take advantage of. So, for example, volunteering, get the NASA Ape center or volunteer, get the aerospace museum or starting any like new types of projects. I think that could be a priority as well.

431
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.210
Jenny Duan: do you have.

432
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:16.200
Shah: Suggestion on where where to start with the coding. I mean, I know he did a little bit, but somehow I just can't. He has it really, just with school, and everything hasn't gotten too deep into. I mean, he's taking computer science now, but just the principles. I think.

433
00:48:16.415 --> 00:48:39.710
Shah: So he can do that much. But you know I I want him to kind of. I don't know if there's projects, or there's apps, or some. Sure there's a bunch out there I just don't know is to get him to like practice a couple of a couple of hours a day, or whatever, especially in the summer. He's gonna have a lot of time, you know. So that way. And then I you know, eventually, hopefully, he gets interested in and making things and doing, because I think that's the only way to learn. If you get kind of interested in it, you know. So.

434
00:48:40.390 --> 00:49:06.820
Jenny Duan: Totally. I'll put some more recommendations for this, actually. But I think that you can start with doing like learning python and getting the skills pi for e.org is a really good resource. I'll put this in the document, so feel free. We'll sit in right now. But I think starting python is a really good point. And then, after that, I'd actually recommend you to join this organization called Hat Club, which is it's for high school students interested in programming. Have you heard about this hat club.

435
00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:08.430
Shah: No, no.

436
00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:22.060
Jenny Duan: It's a really good community. My sister and a lot of my friends have done their programs, but they host a lot of like voting workshops, and they also fly you out. For hackathons. Do you know what a hackathon is? Or have you heard of one?

437
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:43.660
Jenny Duan: Okay, a hackathon is like a weekend experience, about 48 h, usually where you and a team of other students. So in this case it would be other high school students build a concrete project in 48 h. Whether that's a website and app, some people like have rebuilt entire like computer terminals. Some people do hardware hacks. So some people like to build things with like electronics.

438
00:49:43.660 --> 00:50:00.359
Jenny Duan: But you build something within 48 h, just for fun. There's a lot of prizes, I think hackathons are some of the best ways to learn to learn how to build projects, because you have a lot of dolty people around you and Hack Club is the student organization that hosts hackathons, and they will actually pay for your flights

439
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:06.510
Jenny Duan: to go out to. They've had it in Boston. They had one at the figma. Do you know the company, Figma? Have you heard of it?

440
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.700
Jenny Duan: It's this design company they make tools like, do you know what canva is.

441
00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:13.770
Shah: Yeah.

442
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:30.690
Jenny Duan: They make like Tampa, like tools, but like for web design and other other projects. So they had a hackathon at the Finger headquarters in San Francisco. They they do them everywhere, but they will pay for your entire, your flights and everything else, and your meals and stuff for you to go and just build projects with other high school students.

443
00:50:31.063 --> 00:50:46.930
Jenny Duan: And so it's a well established organization. I'll put it in the chat so you can look it up later, but also write on the document. But I think, like joining student organizations like Hack Club and doing actual projects at hackathons with other high school students can be a really good way to learn as well.

444
00:50:49.320 --> 00:51:02.022
Jenny Duan: yeah. And so I think that that should be your plan to Upskill encoding to maybe start our research opportunity and also to focus on involvement in clubs and

445
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:23.390
Jenny Duan: leadership and volunteering. So if you think, if you want to start the Cyber Patriot Club over the summer might be a good time to start planning to see like who your teacher advisor is going to be, who your co-leaders are going to be so. Maybe your vice president, your Treasury secretary, etc, and how you want to plan and optimize your club curriculum for the year.

446
00:51:23.654 --> 00:51:31.300
Jenny Duan: I think summer is like a really good time to do that, so that when you go to the fall you won't have to worry about spending a lot of time on that.

447
00:51:32.214 --> 00:51:39.709
Shah: Actually new clubs are due, like in a week or so for their school like for next year. So

448
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.670
Shah: and.

449
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:41.469
Jenny Duan: So wow.

450
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:42.340
Shah: I just on email.

451
00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:42.960
Jenny Duan: You guys.

452
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:54.679
Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that that's like, it's not too late. If you want to start a club right now, like, if you want to just pull together. 2 friends submit application like, why not? I mean, you could. I mean, most cases would get rejected. But like

453
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:59.149
Jenny Duan: you should just apply to see, because you don't want to miss on this opportunity.

454
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.940
Shah: I think it's May tenth, or something like that.

455
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:09.053
Jenny Duan: Hey? You have about 2 weeks, I think that's enough time to prepare.

456
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:29.794
Jenny Duan: yeah. And then the other thing that we really wanted to focus on is leadership. But I think that that will come through with continued involvement in your clubs and with volunteering especially, I think that now that we have a more focused passion area. On, you know, maybe space education, space science, also on

457
00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.790
Jenny Duan: also on

458
00:52:32.060 --> 00:53:01.960
Jenny Duan: cyber security. That'll be a good place for you to to build impact eventually. And with cyber security, I think that doing something in in regards to Internet safety could be really valuable if you're passionate about like social media safety. I know that there's a lot of talk about betting Tiktok right now. I don't know if you've been following that. But about safety online, especially like social media, mental health and youth. Is this something that you're interested in or not? It's okay. If you're not. By the way, I'm just trying to figure out the social impact aspect of your extra curriculumers.

459
00:53:02.596 --> 00:53:06.703
Shah: He's not really on that with social media. So I don't think it's in his purview.

460
00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.780
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, no, that's actually really good that you're not on social media. I think.

461
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:15.998
Shah: Sorry he's not on Insta and stuff. He's on Youtube and all that. But.

462
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.390
Jenny Duan: Got it. Got it?

463
00:53:18.197 --> 00:53:38.889
Jenny Duan: Maybe I think something that you could also think about is, if there's any opportunities for you to do athletic mentorship in your community, like, for example, if there's a local Rec center, you could start volunteering out leading classes out leading like a training camp. I think that could be really another valuable way for you to demonstrate the social impact aspect while also doing something that you're passionate about.

464
00:53:39.264 --> 00:53:50.090
Jenny Duan: So maybe that's something you can look into this summer, and that's something that I will also do research for as well. If there's any like rec centers. 5. Ca, after school programs that you could maybe volunteer or contribute to.

465
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.420
Jenny Duan: He doesn't.

466
00:53:53.699 --> 00:54:08.490
Shah: San Jose Racquet Club, and he's been there going on and off for a while. I mean, if he would just be a little bit more consistent about going. I know that coach gives opportunities to students to teach like younger students and stuff like that, you know. So it's kind of

467
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:13.130
Shah: that would be kind of a good mentorship type thing, I feel, but you know so.

468
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.260
Jenny Duan: Yeah, how do you feel about that.

469
00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:18.070
Shah: Yeah, I think

470
00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:20.080
Shah: I'd want to coach, maybe

471
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.120
Shah: in the future coach tennis.

472
00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:30.439
Jenny Duan: Great I think that addresses again the leadership aspect that we highlighted in the report, but also the social impact, because

473
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:32.790
Jenny Duan: we've wanted to sort of

474
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:42.980
Jenny Duan: have you have like an impact area or a place that you contribute back to your community. And I think that coaching and mentorship would be a really really good way to demonstrate that. So

475
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:49.079
Jenny Duan: maybe another thing in the summer. So we're we're adding some more things to your summer. So Cs research at the

476
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:50.999
Jenny Duan: being more involved in racquet.

477
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.169
Jenny Duan: Is it tennis?

478
00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:58.749
Shah: But it's called Swim and Racket Club, or something like that, like the play San Jose Swimming Racket Club. Yeah.

479
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.469
Jenny Duan: Got it, maybe being more involved in tennis so that you're able to

480
00:55:03.188 --> 00:55:07.660
Jenny Duan: need a class help an after school program or something like that.

481
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:36.970
Jenny Duan: I think, like eventually, maybe not. This summer. I think it will take more time to build this. But next year, if you started a free camp to introduce, like low income students to tennis, because I think tennis is sort of a higher barrier sports where you need to pay for, you know a club membership. You need to play pay for racquets and obviously know everyone has access to that. So in the future, maybe you could start an after school program or a summer camp like a one week camp for lower income students to learn tennis. And you could be the lead for that. I think that would be really, really cool.

482
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.940
Jenny Duan: Would that be something that you'd be interested in?

483
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.190
Jenny Duan: Yep.

484
00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:47.699
Jenny Duan: okay, cool. So I think we've

485
00:55:48.015 --> 00:55:50.490
Jenny Duan: I know, Sarasha, do you have something to say.

486
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:53.689
Ivylevel: Oh, no, I I think this is great. It's just that, you know.

487
00:55:54.016 --> 00:56:16.463
Ivylevel: I wish that, you know we can actually do more. But I think that's that's it's it's just kind of a you know, preview of, like you know how these sessions go about and you're able to find, and there's a lot of research and golden iterative stuff. So I think you know I know that Jenny was a bit late. So more than happy. I think we can work offline. I mean, you can give us, like, you know, any more questions. I think there's a lot of research again that goes in. And

488
00:56:16.934 --> 00:56:36.020
Ivylevel: if there are any questions, Jenny, again, we can also offline. And you know, if if you really want like to have 1, one more connect. I'm I'm more than happy to also join. Unfortunately, you know, we actually have one more session back to back. Otherwise I would have loved to actually extend it further. So we can actually reconnect. But I, I think, send us like more questions. If that is okay, as well.

489
00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:43.980
Shah: I think I think if Assuraj, if we can review the document, and you know, because every like looking over everything, and then, you know. He may have more questions, and.

490
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.169
Ivylevel: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

491
00:56:45.471 --> 00:56:47.580
Shah: That I think that'll be better. Yeah.

492
00:56:47.580 --> 00:57:01.620
Ivylevel: Absolutely I I think one thing I wanna be like also, like, you know, I just wanna a as I said right? I think I'm absolutely perfectly fine, you know. This 2 weeks is again the you know this. This is a very heavy kind of as you can imagine. There is. There's a lot of work right? It's not a tutoring session.

493
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:16.549
Ivylevel: It is. It is a very strategic kind of session that we show mainly to show the value. But again, you know, like our we are a long term prep program. So I also wanna make sure that we don't over, like, you know, overwhelm you with a lot of information and data.

494
00:57:16.777 --> 00:57:27.829
Ivylevel: Because that's the one of the like we tried to do too good. And then at times 0 parents come back. Oh, this is too much to digest, right? So that's why I think, as you can see, like just in one session like there's so many questions and so many information that has come about

495
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:42.299
Ivylevel: definitely. That's the intent, you know. It's still not in the good shape. Right? So. But I wanted to just show you like, you know how we think about through things. So that, you know, these things take time. Right? So what I would recommend is based on today's session.

496
00:57:42.515 --> 00:58:04.719
Ivylevel: And more than happy right? Even if it takes one more additional week. That's perfectly fine. You don't have to worry about it. I'm more than happy to to really like, you know, clarify anything else. And you know even this 15 min right? If you want to have more time. I'm more than happy to doing that. But I just wanted to. Also, you know, make it very clear that you know our goal is different, right? I really want, because getting these things done is where the magic happens right? It's one thing to give you a list.

497
00:58:05.028 --> 00:58:16.851
Ivylevel: You know, identifying and changing working hand in hand to land, a research project takes time to basically get into a program like NASA gets time, or, you know, even to define a business building a business.

498
00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:17.520
Shah: So.

499
00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:43.050
Shah: So this is my understanding. So this Ca, this, this little intro course that we took, you know you give us a document where. Obviously, that document is not. Gonna get him through the 4 years. But I just wanna look at it. See if we have any questions and make use of what we've already paid for right now and then. Of course, you know, I mean, we have to continue with either you or somebody else. So that's to be very honest, right? We have to continue. We have to do something because I need somebody to talk to him like Jenny's been talking to him

500
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:56.839
Shah: but a little bit more constantly and a little bit, you know, and I would love Jenny to do it. I just wanna make sure. You know, I wanna look at the document. I wanna look at your ideas and then we'll kind of decide to continue or not. And we plan to make this decision in the next week week and a half off.

501
00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.099
Ivylevel: That's perfectly fine. But yeah.

502
00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:24.079
Shah: But this this sessions are just to like, you know, whatever the initial amount that we paid, you know, we wanna like kind of get through that and take it step by step. I mean, we have that little bit of luxury because we're in ninth grade, right? So we just wanna kind of get through that and see the recommendations. Make sure he's good with everything, and then kind of continue, because I want these sessions. I mean paying the regular package price. I just wanna make sure

503
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:31.760
Shah: sure that he's going to take advantage of it. It's not just your company, but I want to make sure that he's going to be all in and do it, you know, so that it's.

504
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.700
Ivylevel: So both.

505
00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.140
Shah: You know.

506
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:51.990
Ivylevel: Yeah, no, I I think you know, that's you know, it's kind of a double edged sword, right? I think. first thing is like, you know, there is this kind of a request. Of course, you know we all need a service, and we expect, like, you know. I'm I'm a parent. I'm a customer like I pay. I wanna. All I can tell you is that these are iterative things. So while I can give you a lot of information.

507
00:59:52.030 --> 01:00:10.705
Ivylevel: All I'm telling you is that it might not even be the thing that he would be eventually executing upon right? So I think more. Yeah, more is not the point. I think I just wanted my job again. Like is to make parents understand. How do we iteratively go through these kind of things that why is this a long term program? And I think you know

508
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:22.720
Ivylevel: pro, I I mean, like, I mean I mean, uncle actually came to me through a referral like I never reached out to him. So I think proof is in the pudding like. But I also wanna make sure that at times, because what happens is like, you know, the expectations need to be right.

509
01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:34.609
Ivylevel: I think we already do quite a lot. But sometimes, you know, like there's oh, yeah, I mean, I only got 3 things, and I don't want you to actually base off a decision based on one report as an example. What I wanted to see is

510
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:43.419
Ivylevel: the the the kind of quality and framework that we have created on how we approach. And, honestly speaking, this is a transformation that parents cannot drive.

511
01:00:43.750 --> 01:01:05.439
Ivylevel: The point I want to. Highlight is like, you know, it's not that. You know. Arian and I, I can completely relate with Arian right? There are many students who actually go through that kind of a transformation. I think that is where you know. Working with the coaches is kind of important. Anyways, I'm more than happy to, you know. Talk. But again, you're absolutely I just wanted to show you I would love to help further. But thanks a lot for your time, please.

512
01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:25.130
Shah: Him to be like, ask these probing questions. So that's why I do like the format. So far, I do like, you know, so far how it's going. It just it's nice, because it's hard to make that decision in right real time. Right? So if we have this document and then. Okay. Oh, remember, Jenny said this or whatever that we can discuss it better. We have something to look at, you know.

513
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:45.753
Ivylevel: Yeah, I mean, see, as you can see, right? I mean, I can actually claim right, like, I've spent like more than 30,000. I've been in this space 6 years, right? I mean, I would love to see another report that has this level of detail and precision. So don't worry about it. We're gonna come up with a lot of details. But all I wanted to also like, you know, do not just like judge our kind of service, I think the real magic service so.

514
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.113
Shah: Due to the weekend. Yeah.

515
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.150
Ivylevel: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.

516
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.320
Jenny Duan: Thank you so much. Take care!

517
01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.220
Shah: Hi, Jenny!

518
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.020
Shah: Aye.
