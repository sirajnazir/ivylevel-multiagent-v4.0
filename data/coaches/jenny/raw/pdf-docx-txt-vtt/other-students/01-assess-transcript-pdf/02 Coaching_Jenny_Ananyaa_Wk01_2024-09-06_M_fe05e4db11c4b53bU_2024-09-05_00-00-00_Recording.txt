1
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.280
Ivylevel: Hi, Jenny, how are you?

2
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.829
Jenny Duan: Hi! I'm doing well. How are you? Hi, Nanya! Hi! Dt.

3
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.230
Ivylevel: Hi, Lynia! How are you?

4
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.480
Ivylevel: Hi! Editi?

5
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.230
Ivylevel: Great

6
00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:47.920
Ivylevel: otherwise your mom and dad also here just wanted to say, Hi.

7
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.729
Ivylevel: Hi! Can you hear me?

8
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.319
Ivylevel: We can't hear you.

9
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.290
Ivylevel: yeah.

10
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.820
Ivylevel: Can you speak now? And you actually

11
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.090
Ivylevel: how strange!

12
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.169
Ivylevel: Yeah, I still can't hear you.

13
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.010
Ivylevel: I see that you're

14
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.720
Ivylevel: you're not on mute.

15
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.299
Ivylevel: so you should be. I think it's probably.

16
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.629
Ananyaa Srivastava: No, you should be better.

17
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.490
Ivylevel: Yeah. Yeah. Good. Cool.

18
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.110
Ivylevel: Awesome.

19
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.110
Ananyaa Srivastava: Microphone is connected to the headset. That's what.

20
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.960
Ivylevel: Good

21
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.500
Ivylevel: thanks. Hi! Amit right amit, and danvi, and you know, welcome on board.

22
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.360
Ananyaa Srivastava: The summit.

23
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.009
Ivylevel: Great.

24
00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.999
Ivylevel: Yeah, Alanya, welcome on board. Super excited to having you.

25
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.770
Ivylevel: and can't wait to see all the magic that we are able to. You know. Do with you.

26
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.060
Ananyaa Srivastava: Of course.

27
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.579
Ivylevel: It's really a fun journey. So I want you to be right, really like, be very positive about it.

28
00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:33.950
Ivylevel: With no pressure. I think it's it's a it's a journey of discovery. It's a journey of really, you know growth.

29
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.359
Ivylevel: It's a journey of transformation, all for good.

30
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.809
Ivylevel: And I have Jenny with me here. Who's our head coach? Who's been, you know, with us for a long time.

31
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.450
Ivylevel: and she's been very instrumental in transforming, you know.

32
00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:52.010
Ivylevel: Literally the lives of, you know, multiple students

33
00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.380
Ivylevel: and Aditi as well. Who's joined us this year. But she's already been doing great with, you know, some other students as well.

34
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:13.370
Ivylevel: So it's really your relatable team, I think. Parents and I, we need to take a back seat here. It's really a journey between you and your coaches, but what we do is really we work as a team.

35
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:42.969
Ivylevel: so we try to bring. The best of all. You know, composite is always greater than some of parts. So it's a power of team that we bring a lot of diverse talents and expertise, you know, from you know, highly specialized team of Stanford coaches, but also, like lot of custom tools and a lot of technology. And you know, frameworks and and everything at your disposal. Right? So this is the 1st session, and I know that when I spoke to your mom and and you earlier. I gave you a glimpse of you know how we start.

36
00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:49.160
Ivylevel: You know, this is a long term journey of prep. So it needs to be strategized.

37
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.499
Ivylevel: And there needs to be a game plan in place. And it's an evolving thing. So it isn't a static thing that where we say that this is what you need to do.

38
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.279
Ivylevel: It's a recurring process.

39
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:17.420
Ivylevel: What we are gonna do today is really set in a direction. And I think the fundamental difference, especially like for Indian parents, right coming from a different background. Having not studied here, I would assume, you know, like one of the fundamental differences between the Indian education system or the Chinese education system. Asian education system

40
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.279
Ivylevel: in terms of elite schools and college prep is

41
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:30.369
Ivylevel: that is very objective, 99%. Everything that matters think about iits. Think of anything else. All you need is a data point. You need to go through a competitive exam.

42
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.149
Ivylevel: And you need to have good grades. That's about it. I think the same applies for the top Chinese university as well. Right?

43
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.850
Ivylevel: What is the main difference in getting into or cracking the top. You know, elite schools in the world

44
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.020
Ivylevel: is a subjectivity. It's not objectivity. That's a fundamental difference.

45
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.220
Ivylevel: Yes, 25%

46
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.709
Ivylevel: of the standout factor that really decides at the end of the day. What gets you in is you

47
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.189
Ivylevel: right? That is why it becomes very interesting.

48
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.209
Ivylevel: because anything that is done objectively without factoring the one and only thing that really matters

49
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.250
Ivylevel: does not have an effect and impact.

50
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:23.299
Ivylevel: And it's all very connected. And I think Jenny can very beautifully articulate it for you. Anything and everything you do and see. Eventually, let's work backwards. It all boils down to 10 extracurricular activities. That's another fundamental difference

51
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.689
Ivylevel: that academics is not the main significant factor at the end of the day to get you in.

52
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:39.790
Ivylevel: It's in non academics, because the kind of people they're looking for, that you have, Jenny here, and Aditi here, and many other kind of brilliant coaches we have, you know, mainly from Stanford, mainly because Stanford, you know.

53
00:05:40.263 --> 00:06:00.860
Ivylevel: is is kind of a very unique top iv plus school. And you know, they've also got admitted into many other schools is that you know? They all stood out right. So that's the relatability. And they did very impactful work, which is very well aligned cohesively with their narrative, with their profile, with their identity.

54
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.179
Ivylevel: Right? So th! That's why it's very important that you are involved in this journey, and you team up

55
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.980
Ivylevel: every week after week after week

56
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.489
Ivylevel: you strategize, you plan, you execute. It doesn't really matter about you know how many awards you won, how many checklist items you have done.

57
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.969
Ivylevel: The sure way to not stand out is to just follow the crowd.

58
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.760
Ivylevel: So it is about doing unique things. It's not about doing some passion project. It's about doing something which is very uniquely.

59
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.130
Ivylevel: Anonia.

60
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:40.220
Ivylevel: Every bit of your college application finally has to tell a narrative. It should not be a checklist. That's a fundamental difference. Academics is checklist

61
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.960
Ivylevel: grade, one grade, 2. Grade subject, one. Subject, 2. That's the easiest part.

62
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.039
Ivylevel: How do you build extracurriculars. That's very qualitative. It's not quantitative.

63
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:58.620
Ivylevel: So that is the beauty of it. And I think that's the journey. So today's session is really something that Jenny will lead. You know she's our head coach, and you know Aditya is gonna

64
00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:05.469
Ivylevel: again chime in as needed. But she's gonna observe you. And and what what's gonna happen is really it's

65
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.649
Ivylevel: understanding who you are. What's what's your profile? What are your passions?

66
00:07:10.312 --> 00:07:15.000
Ivylevel: Really getting to know you at a very, you know a broad and a deep level.

67
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.329
Ivylevel: So we have done this for many, many students.

68
00:07:17.628 --> 00:07:27.080
Ivylevel: So I'm just gonna go on on mute and silence now. And it's just a show between you and and Jenny. Just enjoy this session, and then we'll take it from there. Make sense.

69
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.090
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

70
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.520
Ananyaa Srivastava: thanks. Raj.

71
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:55.820
Jenny Duan: Awesome. Hi, Nanya, it's really nice to meet you, and I think so. Raj kind of set everything up pretty nicely. So hopefully, you have some context for today's session. So today is one of 2 sessions, and the 1st one will be trying to get to know you. It'll be a lot of me sort of asking you questions, and then from that, what our team will do is we'll create some ideas for what you can work on to strengthen your profile, and then we'll start building on to those in the second session.

72
00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:03.689
Jenny Duan: What that could look like is perhaps suggestions of summer programs that you might be a good fit for extracurriculars that really tie along with your profile and

73
00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:16.409
Jenny Duan: sort of the idea of what we want to show for bringing your passions and your interests and your hobbies, and also your career aspirations together in one cohesive profile. And when I say profile, I mean, it's

74
00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:36.479
Jenny Duan: a way to represent you within the context of a college application. So understanding that you're more than just a college application. But a college application is a way for you to better understand yourself, and also what your goals are, and how your different extracurriculars come together to shape what you do, and the impact you can have on the world one day.

75
00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:51.250
Jenny Duan: So with that, do you have any questions before I get started? How it will go is I'll probably ask you for questions for about 40 min, and then I'll leave some time at the end. If you or your parents have any questions about you, or we can talk through some of your concerns. Does that sound good? Do you have any other questions.

76
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.365
Ananyaa Srivastava: Good.

77
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.539
Ananyaa Srivastava: I don't you? None so far, thank you.

78
00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:58.749
Jenny Duan: Awesome, feel free to.

79
00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:25.329
Ananyaa Srivastava: What? What Siraj earlier mentioned is what we have been struggling with as well like, you know. We know the objective way of doing je in India very well. But the you know this whole guidance on how does she improve her other things? She's a good student. She gets good grades. And you know she has her passions. But how does she stand out from

80
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:39.259
Ananyaa Srivastava: many, many other good students? That's that's the guidance which which we are looking for. So thank you so much for the introduction, and we, we are willing to put in all 3 of us. We are willing to put in quite a bit of effort to make us successful.

81
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:49.419
Jenny Duan: Yeah, amazing. That sounds really good. Well, to start off, I looked a bit at your form submission and I saw that you go to Eastlake High School in Washington, right.

82
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.160
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

83
00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:53.990
Jenny Duan: Is that close to how close? What suburb of Washington is that in.

84
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.559
Ananyaa Srivastava: That's in Samish.

85
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.278
Jenny Duan: Samish Washington cool. I'm from Portland, Oregon. So like also Pacific, Northwest.

86
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:22.449
Jenny Duan: yeah. I thought also, before I get started, I could do an introduction about me, because it seems like I already know a bit about you. But I feel like you don't know anything about me, so we can start with that. I'm Jenny. I'm a rising junior at Stanford University. I study symbolic systems, which is an interdisciplinary major, and we'll get more into what that means later on, that combines

87
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:34.879
Jenny Duan: computer science, philosophy, psychology, linguistics, statistics, and math. But my concentrations on human centered AI. So I think a lot about what AI is and how that impacts the world. And that's what I spend most of my time studying.

88
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.190
Jenny Duan: with that, let's get more into your profile. So you're from Samish Washington. Did you grow up there?

89
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.590
Ananyaa Srivastava: More or less. Yeah, we moved here when I was what? 3?

90
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.210
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

91
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.909
Ananyaa Srivastava: from Chicago.

92
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.380
Jenny Duan: From Chicago.

93
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:59.590
Jenny Duan: Awesome. And at high school you're entering your sophomore year 1st of all, like, how do you feel about that? Has school already started. And how's everything going school? Wise.

94
00:11:00.188 --> 00:11:02.399
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah. School started just this week.

95
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.770
Ananyaa Srivastava: It's going pretty well so far. I think I could

96
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.919
Ananyaa Srivastava: manage the workload fairly easily as long as I keep on top of homework.

97
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.870
Jenny Duan: Awesome. Can you tell me a little bit more about what your course load or workload looks like this year?

98
00:11:16.913 --> 00:11:24.659
Ananyaa Srivastava: I'm taking French. 3 ap computer science applications ap world history. Honors English.

99
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.250
Ananyaa Srivastava: But Alex

100
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:32.150
Ananyaa Srivastava: physics, one calculus a b, a B. Calculus a B, and

101
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.380
Ananyaa Srivastava: missing something.

102
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.290
Ananyaa Srivastava: chemistry, honors, chemistry.

103
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.759
Ananyaa Srivastava: so on and so

104
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:44.480
Ananyaa Srivastava: oh, one sec, Jenny, so she might get into physics, too. But that's with the counselor yet.

105
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.260
Ananyaa Srivastava: Right? Yeah.

106
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.789
Ananyaa Srivastava: So she took ap physics one over the summer.

107
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.300
Ananyaa Srivastava: not over the summer last year. Yeah.

108
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.629
Jenny Duan: So you took ap physics one over the summer, but you're taking physics one in school right now.

109
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.640
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes, like I self studied for the Ap. Test, and I got a 4,

110
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:08.109
Ananyaa Srivastava: and I talked to my counselor about going to Ap. Physics, too, but she hasn't really responded yet.

111
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.769
Jenny Duan: Okay. And how long ago did you send that message to your counselor?

112
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:21.030
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay. So I talked to her. Well, I emailed her over the summer and she said that I had to fill out a form that goes out on the 1st day of school if I wanted to change my course.

113
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.050
Ananyaa Srivastava: and that's what I did. But no response. So far.

114
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:32.480
Jenny Duan: Right and maybe you can reach back out to her like on Monday to see if

115
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:42.119
Jenny Duan: she has seen that form. You can just send her a follow up email on Monday. I would recommend doing that. So you're taking pretty much all Aps and honors except for French. 3 right?

116
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.750
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

117
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.790
Jenny Duan: And do you have French for? Or are you going straight into French

118
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.940
Jenny Duan: ap French next year?

119
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:54.539
Ananyaa Srivastava: I think there is a French 4, and we definitely do have ap French. But I'm not certain

120
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.009
Ananyaa Srivastava: I can look at the course catalog if you want.

121
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.799
Jenny Duan: it's okay. No, no need. What did you take last year?

122
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.300
Ananyaa Srivastava: I took

123
00:13:05.954 --> 00:13:09.640
Ananyaa Srivastava: I took ap computer science principles.

124
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.710
Ananyaa Srivastava: French, 2

125
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.111
Ananyaa Srivastava: honors, English honors, humanities. Well, honors.

126
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.040
Ananyaa Srivastava: what?

127
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.940
Ananyaa Srivastava: No. I took precalculus.

128
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.400
Ananyaa Srivastava: not honors, humanities. It was honors, civics, or something.

129
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.345
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

130
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.950
Ananyaa Srivastava: what else?

131
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.219
Ananyaa Srivastava: Precalculus? Yeah, it's a precalculus already

132
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.359
Ananyaa Srivastava: hardly forgotten.

133
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:36.740
Aditi B: Pure science.

134
00:13:37.325 --> 00:13:37.910
Ananyaa Srivastava: But

135
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.477
Ananyaa Srivastava: right honors biology, and thank you.

136
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.710
Ananyaa Srivastava: Something else.

137
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.950
Ananyaa Srivastava: Oh, fitness.

138
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.260
Ananyaa Srivastava: fitness, and health.

139
00:13:49.475 --> 00:13:58.119
Jenny Duan: And just curious like, how would you describe the atmosphere at your school? Is it very stressful? Is it very competitive? Is it more chill.

140
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.970
Ananyaa Srivastava: That's

141
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.990
Ananyaa Srivastava: hmm.

142
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:15.820
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, I would say that it's pretty chill in terms of actual coursework. But the students there are fairly competitive, like, there's a lot of clubs, and most, if not all, students, do a lot of extracurricular stuff.

143
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.150
Jenny Duan: Gotcha how would you say?

144
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:24.550
Ananyaa Srivastava: I mean, I do feel a lot of students, not you. They do feel that academics are

145
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.990
Ananyaa Srivastava: pretty competitive. That's your personal opinion, right?

146
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.130
Ananyaa Srivastava: Oh, you said Chill. But there are, I know personally

147
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:39.519
Ananyaa Srivastava: some of the friends, some of the people who you used to be friends with. They feel that it's pretty competitive. It's tough. The courses are tough.

148
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:53.440
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah. Yeah. So, Jenny, it could be because Anania comes from quest background. And she was a little ahead. So that's why, compared to Quest, which is the gifted program in middle school. She finds the pace easier.

149
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.350
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

150
00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:08.049
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. That's really good. So do you feel like among your peers? Are you taking classes that are pretty typical? Are you taking a more challenging course load than most of your peers? Or is it somewhere in between.

151
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:14.899
Ananyaa Srivastava: It's not uncommon to do what I do, but it's not like super common either. So somewhere in the middle.

152
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.710
Jenny Duan: Okay, do, are there people taking more challenging courses than you are?

153
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.220
Ananyaa Srivastava: I know. Maybe like one or 2 people.

154
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:30.410
Ananyaa Srivastava: one or 2 people taking instead of honors chemistry. They're taking ap chemistry because they took honors chemistry over the summer, and then skipped over to physics, too. Like I'm trying to.

155
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.650
Jenny Duan: Gotcha are.

156
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:43.789
Ananyaa Srivastava: Any another another thing that those some of the kids are doing. Very few of them are doing like the math program that they were in. They. Some of them are doing that. Uw, math.

157
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.570
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah, which I didn't do. Yeah. But that was pre calculus. No.

158
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:56.150
Ananyaa Srivastava: yeah. They have the University of Washington version of the math program also, which is tougher than just regular pick calc.

159
00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.250
Jenny Duan: Got it. Does your school have a ranking system.

160
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.160
Ananyaa Srivastava: You know.

161
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.610
Jenny Duan: No, okay, cool.

162
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.589
Jenny Duan: That's pretty healthy. I? Yeah, I don't think it's good to rank students.

163
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:16.370
Jenny Duan: And do you feel appropriately challenged by your courses. Do you feel like you could be taking harder courses? Or do you feel like this is a good level for you?

164
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:24.730
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, I'm not sure about this year, because the school year just started. I'm gonna guess it will be more challenging than last year, because last year was

165
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.460
Ananyaa Srivastava: quite easy. I'm gonna be honest.

166
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:43.079
Jenny Duan: Yeah, well, that's good. I think that you know high school oftentimes should feel a little bit lighter. And if it does feel lighter, and you are taking hard classes. That just means you have more time to dedicate to things outside of school, which is cool. How's your relationship with your teachers? Would you say.

167
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:50.239
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, I am on the quieter side, so I don't interact with them a lot. But when I do, generally they like me.

168
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:55.200
Jenny Duan: Cool. Do you have like a favorite teacher, or one that you're particularly close with.

169
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.380
Ananyaa Srivastava: I'd say so.

170
00:16:59.023 --> 00:17:00.169
Jenny Duan: Which one.

171
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.679
Ananyaa Srivastava: My ap world history and English teacher

172
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.069
Ananyaa Srivastava: cause I think you

173
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.449
Ananyaa Srivastava: good sense of humor.

174
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.280
Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah.

175
00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:31.130
Jenny Duan: One thing that I would keep in mind this year is because you're approaching your sophomore year. I would try to like, try to get closer with teachers because you need, you're gonna start needing a lot of letters of recommendations for like different programs that you apply to even before college. Like, if you apply to an award or a scholarship program or a summer program, you're gonna need to have a letter of recommendation. So I'd focus on trying to develop your

176
00:17:31.404 --> 00:17:50.620
Jenny Duan: relationships with, especially like your stem teachers and also your humanities teachers. So like you're in your core classes try to strengthen your relationships because over time, like throughout high school, you're going to need their support on different things that you do. And it's nice to have an existing relationship with them and not have to scramble and worry about letters of recommendations at the last minute.

177
00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:59.639
Jenny Duan: So that's 1 thing I would definitely keep in mind as you approach your school year. Is there anything that you're worried about like going into the sophomore year, or anything that's kind of top of mind?

178
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.630
Ananyaa Srivastava: Top of mind. Ap world history. From what I've heard, it's a pretty tough class.

179
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.570
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

180
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.549
Ananyaa Srivastava: Lot of memorization and dates.

181
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:15.829
Jenny Duan: Definitely are you? Do you consider yourself more like a stem having a stem, mind or humanities, mind? Or do you handle both pretty well?

182
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:32.595
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, I definitely lean towards them. But I'm not bad at humanities. I don't think I'm bad at humanity. Yeah, yeah. She has good decent writing skills and comprehensive skills. Also, I think it should be fine. Yeah, some mugging up in old history, I guess.

183
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:44.829
Jenny Duan: Yeah, totally. Makes a lot of sense. So you said that you're interested in stem can you tell me like, what about stem, or what specific aspect of stem you're interested in. And and how did you get gain that interest.

184
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.270
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well.

185
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:53.950
Ananyaa Srivastava: probably computer science cause, I think, what like, a year ago, I started participating in Usacco.

186
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:55.200
Jenny Duan: And.

187
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.179
Ananyaa Srivastava: I quite like it. It's fun.

188
00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.120
Jenny Duan: What do you like about it?

189
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:10.569
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, it's satisfying to get a problem right? It's not like super duper easy, but it's not impossible if you like. Study and practice.

190
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.489
Ananyaa Srivastava: And I like puzzles and stuff like that. So.

191
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.869
Jenny Duan: Yeah, have you always liked puzzles?

192
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.600
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes, yeah, Jenny, that's true.

193
00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:27.119
Ananyaa Srivastava: Ever since she was a toddler. Yeah, we used to solve a lot of puzzles. So yeah.

194
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.980
Jenny Duan: That's awesome. Do you like math, too? Or or more computer science.

195
00:19:31.674 --> 00:19:42.049
Ananyaa Srivastava: I used to dislike math, but then I got like a math teacher, or you know, and I got a lot better at it, and since then I liked it.

196
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.699
Jenny Duan: Yeah, have you taken like a number theory class? Ever.

197
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.810
Ananyaa Srivastava: No.

198
00:19:47.430 --> 00:20:08.760
Jenny Duan: Okay, that's 1 thing I would probably recommend you to do is to explore more math, because I think you know, math and Cs, obviously go really well together and getting the foundation for like number theory, logic can be really helpful when I'm doing use of other like coding competitions. And also eventually doing math competitions, too. In the future. Do you see yourself like

199
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.900
Jenny Duan: studying computer science in college? Or are there other subjects that you're still exploring and are interested in.

200
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:21.190
Ananyaa Srivastava: Right now I would lean towards computer science. But I'm not like completely close to anything else. If it interests me.

201
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:35.759
Jenny Duan: Yeah, and have besides, you Sicko, have you done any other like computer science related activities? I know that you, are are working on a website design for a corporation. Can you tell me a bit about that?

202
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.350
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well.

203
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:45.276
Ananyaa Srivastava: it involves learning a lot of like other languages like HTML more Javascript, like frameworks, and.

204
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.390
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

205
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.240
Ananyaa Srivastava: And

206
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.420
Ananyaa Srivastava: oh.

207
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.120
Ananyaa Srivastava: it's okay, I guess.

208
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:59.839
Jenny Duan: Okay, it's just okay. So I'm sensing that there's like something up with it. Why, why, just okay.

209
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.649
Ananyaa Srivastava: It's okay, because, honestly, I find it kind of confusing to do.

210
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.609
Jenny Duan: Yeah, what about it is confusing.

211
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.630
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, I'm not

212
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:18.770
Ananyaa Srivastava: very good at like React Js. And next js, I think it's just a matter of like I didn't have a lot of time, and I was trying to crunch it all in

213
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.020
Ananyaa Srivastava: and

214
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:25.559
Ananyaa Srivastava: kind of create a block in my head. I guess that makes sense.

215
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.450
Jenny Duan: How long have you been working there?

216
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:29.980
Ananyaa Srivastava: So long.

217
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.400
Ananyaa Srivastava: Why don't you didn't? A few months April, right? Yeah. A few months.

218
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.330
Jenny Duan: And how did you? How did you find this role.

219
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.489
Ananyaa Srivastava: Stressful honestly.

220
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.719
Ananyaa Srivastava: No, she's asking, how did you find.

221
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.739
Jenny Duan: How did how did you find it? Yeah, like, how did you.

222
00:21:48.245 --> 00:21:54.089
Ananyaa Srivastava: On Jenny, a friend of mine. She's 1 of the founding founding members of the company.

223
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.840
Ananyaa Srivastava: So that's how.

224
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.133
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool.

225
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.190
Jenny Duan: and what kind of projects have you worked on through that organization?

226
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.850
Ananyaa Srivastava: So I've been making some

227
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.870
Ananyaa Srivastava: website pages like

228
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.709
Ananyaa Srivastava: website page design.

229
00:22:11.054 --> 00:22:18.380
Jenny Duan: Like? Do you work with external clients like? Who do you work with? Is it for startups, or do you do it for small businesses, or who are the clients.

230
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.550
Ananyaa Srivastava: But directly for the website that they have the company.

231
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.290
Jenny Duan: Oh, it's for the company's website. Okay.

232
00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:24.870
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

233
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.200
Ananyaa Srivastava: so.

234
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.610
Jenny Duan: And what's a couple.

235
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.510
Ananyaa Srivastava: Solutions Company. It's a climate Solutions company

236
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:37.020
Ananyaa Srivastava: based out of India, but they have headquarters in 5 countries like Singapore

237
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.569
Ananyaa Srivastava: in a couple of other countries in Germany, and so on.

238
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.670
Ananyaa Srivastava: Oh.

239
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:57.179
Jenny Duan: Got it. Yeah, that sounds really cool. I think there's so there's a big difference between kind of doing like front end web development work versus, like used to coast more like algorithms problem solving. And more. That type of computer science. What type do you find yourself more drawn to.

240
00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.970
Ananyaa Srivastava: Definitely used to go.

241
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:08.080
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, have you? Explored anything in like the machine learning space or more? Writing algorithms for different purposes. Besides, competition.

242
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.700
Ananyaa Srivastava: I've been meaning to. But no.

243
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:24.798
Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that you might find that interesting because that uses like, I guess, the same type of problem solving skills that you saw code does and not like the design and front end stuff that maybe web development would. So I would consider doing that. And then

244
00:23:25.422 --> 00:23:45.149
Jenny Duan: to gain the foundation for machine learning and artificial intelligence. That's again about like strengthening your math and statistics skills. So I would highly recommend, like trying to explore that and finding opportunities to strengthen your math background and maybe learn some statistics, because that's directly contributes to to success in AI and Ml, learning.

245
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.751
Jenny Duan: yeah, so that sounds cool.

246
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.889
Jenny Duan: at your school like what would you say? Your Gpa is.

247
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.979
Jenny Duan: and do you have weighted Gpas.

248
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.470
Ananyaa Srivastava: It's not weighted, and

249
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:08.129
Ananyaa Srivastava: I checked my transcript, and I have a 4.0. But I got a B plus in English for one semester. Last year.

250
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.570
Jenny Duan: Okay, so how does that affect your transcript? Or how will that.

251
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.230
Ananyaa Srivastava: Mostly 4.0. But

252
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:14.920
Ananyaa Srivastava: yeah.

253
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.510
Jenny Duan: What

254
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.839
Jenny Duan: sorry can you repeat that? I think you cut out a bit.

255
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.749
Ananyaa Srivastava: I'm sorry. So I checked my official transcript, and it still says 4 point. Oh.

256
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.190
Jenny Duan: Oh, then how does that B plus factor into your Gpa. Then.

257
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.200
Ananyaa Srivastava: I'm not sure

258
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.759
Ananyaa Srivastava: I can send.

259
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:53.990
Jenny Duan: That might be something to clarify, just to see like if that's gonna affect your Gpa later on. I mean, if so, that's okay, too, but just like knowing where you stand there and making sure that like when you send it to schools and things, there's not gonna be an error. So I would try to like get some clarity there. Not a big deal, either way. But

260
00:24:53.990 --> 00:25:06.849
Jenny Duan: yeah, that sounds good. So can you tell me more about. I already know that you're doing this web design for the Climate Solutions Company, and you do use a code. Is Yusuco through a club at school. Are you doing this on your own.

261
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.030
Ananyaa Srivastava: On my own.

262
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.112
Jenny Duan: Do you have a coach, or how are you learning?

263
00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.599
Ananyaa Srivastava: I've just been learning on my own.

264
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.270
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, with my dad.

265
00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.150
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay.

266
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:28.620
Jenny Duan: Sounds good. Yeah. Congratulations on being bronze qualified, highly encourage you again to explore gold, and then I mean silver, and then hopefully, gold at some point. Have you done any hackathons at all?

267
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:29.940
Ananyaa Srivastava: No.

268
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:39.459
Jenny Duan: Okay, hackathons might be something that you could be interested in exploring, too. I know that like front end design and and Ui development isn't your favorite thing. But

269
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:46.018
Jenny Duan: I think hackathons are a cool way to like build projects and strengthen your computer science skills without

270
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:56.339
Jenny Duan: spending too much time, because they're, you know, short events that you can like upscale very quickly on at your school. Is there a big community for people interested in computer science? Or are you like.

271
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:56.840
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

272
00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.190
Jenny Duan: One of the only people. Okay, cool. Do you have a lot of friends who do it?

273
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.070
Ananyaa Srivastava: A decent view. Yeah.

274
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.570
Jenny Duan: Yeah, is that through girls who code at your school? Or is that through a different medium.

275
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.429
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, I just know a lot of kids in general who do computer science stuff.

276
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.300
Ananyaa Srivastava: Sorry, I think your voice is cutting out.

277
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.940
Jenny Duan: Oh! Can you hear me?

278
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.979
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes, I can hear you now.

279
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:25.140
Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Can you tell me a bit about what computer science honor society is.

280
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:36.620
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, it's just a club where you have to do like some amount of volunteering hours, and you have to attend all the meetings, and they talk about computer science related things

281
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.270
Ananyaa Srivastava: to get like

282
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.430
Ananyaa Srivastava: verified.

283
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.830
Ananyaa Srivastava: That's it.

284
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.780
Jenny Duan: What does that mean to get verified?

285
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.449
Ananyaa Srivastava: So you're like.

286
00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.439
Ananyaa Srivastava: you're like, officially a member of the club for that year.

287
00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.419
Jenny Duan: Is it a competitive club like? Are there a lot of people in it?

288
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.779
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes, there are a lot of people in that.

289
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.030
Jenny Duan: And

290
00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.380
Jenny Duan: go ahead.

291
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:15.789
Ananyaa Srivastava: Do you hold competitions or some such? No, there are no really competitions. What do people do when you meet say for the meeting meeting. It's monthly, and you learn about a topic. You practice some activity related to that topic.

292
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.550
Ananyaa Srivastava: And

293
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.410
Ananyaa Srivastava: that's it, really

294
00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.869
Ananyaa Srivastava: so how is it different from your regular curriculum.

295
00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.500
Ananyaa Srivastava: You said you learn about a topic.

296
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.219
Ananyaa Srivastava: Is it outside of the curriculum that you have? Yeah.

297
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.620
Ananyaa Srivastava: give us some example, like a small example.

298
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.540
Ananyaa Srivastava: We did something on

299
00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.680
Ananyaa Srivastava: trying to remember.

300
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.180
Ananyaa Srivastava: We did stuff on AI for sure.

301
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.939
Ananyaa Srivastava: like, you just touch a topic in general. Right? Yeah.

302
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:52.019
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah. And then, once a month, you do something else.

303
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.030
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay?

304
00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:01.020
Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay? And what's your role in this club? And what's some examples of like the volunteering that you've done to become a member.

305
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.830
Ananyaa Srivastava: So I'm just a participant in the club.

306
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:11.519
Ananyaa Srivastava: and last year I only earned my

307
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.080
Ananyaa Srivastava: iron, my

308
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:18.169
Ananyaa Srivastava: volunteering hours by creating problems for the club.

309
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.730
Ananyaa Srivastava: Oh, that reminds me so. We have like another.

310
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:26.529
Ananyaa Srivastava: I don't remember the exact name, but they have like a smaller club. That's kind of in the club

311
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.910
Ananyaa Srivastava: which is for solving competitive programming problems.

312
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.160
Ananyaa Srivastava: And I created some problems for that

313
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.190
Ananyaa Srivastava: club. And I participate in that, too.

314
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.220
Jenny Duan: You guys all train for Usco together.

315
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.949
Ananyaa Srivastava: Not quite musical level stuff. But

316
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.960
Ananyaa Srivastava: yes.

317
00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:50.969
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then is girls who go to school club? Or are you just a part of their summer programs?

318
00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.189
Ananyaa Srivastava: Nope, it's a it's a club high school.

319
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.829
Jenny Duan: Cool, and then what about the oh, go ahead.

320
00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:03.640
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes, girls, Dakota is part of a larger organization. But I don't do anything related to that.

321
00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:04.940
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay.

322
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:11.219
Ananyaa Srivastava: okay. I didn't know that. I thought, it's the larger organization. And you guys do something over there.

323
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:21.959
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So at school. You're part of this computer science honors society girls. Who code. What is the Journalism School club that you're a part of. And what do you do? There.

324
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.960
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay? So basically, we meet up every week. And we

325
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.659
Ananyaa Srivastava: do jerk, like.

326
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.020
Ananyaa Srivastava: yeah, we create articles for the

327
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.810
Ananyaa Srivastava: what's it called like school website.

328
00:29:37.778 --> 00:29:39.869
Jenny Duan: And what's your role? There.

329
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.599
Ananyaa Srivastava: Usually I make articles.

330
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.330
Jenny Duan: What's an example of something that you've written.

331
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:53.029
Ananyaa Srivastava: I started something on the conflict between Palestine and Israel, but I never actually finished it.

332
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.500
Jenny Duan: What's something else that you've published?

333
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.020
Ananyaa Srivastava: Haven't really published anything.

334
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.630
Jenny Duan: Do you plan to get more involved this year?

335
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:16.220
Jenny Duan: Awesome. And then what is like the leadership structure for clubs at your school look like our underclassmen allowed to be have leadership positions. Is this something that you can be elected towards? And do you have any plans to take on leadership roles within these clubs.

336
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.020
Ananyaa Srivastava: Typically, you have, like

337
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.169
Ananyaa Srivastava: 2 or 3 club officers per

338
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.380
Ananyaa Srivastava: club. And you take an interview. If you want to

339
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.830
Ananyaa Srivastava: get that position.

340
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.290
Jenny Duan: Yeah, is this something that you've been thinking about at all? Through your clubs?

341
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:34.660
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

342
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:40.099
Jenny Duan: What! What does that look like? When would you have the opportunity to interview.

343
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:46.470
Ananyaa Srivastava: Usually it's towards the end of the year, and I applied for some positions last year, but I didn't get in.

344
00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:52.880
Jenny Duan: Got it, would you say, like leadership is pretty easy to get at the club, or is it pretty? Is it.

345
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.190
Ananyaa Srivastava: Fairly competitive.

346
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.040
Jenny Duan: It's really competitive. Okay?

347
00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:13.529
Jenny Duan: So one thing that I think is important is demonstrated leadership in school activities. And if that's not attainable through like the traditional processes. What you can do is you can like start your own organization or club, and like, that's like a fast track to get a leadership role? Is this something that you've thought about or considered at all?

348
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.590
Ananyaa Srivastava: I've thought about it.

349
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:16.600
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

350
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:22.100
Jenny Duan: Yeah, would you be interested in starting your own club? And do you know and like what type of club you would want to start.

351
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:29.659
Ananyaa Srivastava: The thing is that there's a lot of clubs at my school, for, like nearly everything like mainstream.

352
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:34.559
Ananyaa Srivastava: So it's it's tough to come up with an idea to start a club for.

353
00:31:35.765 --> 00:31:43.190
Aditi B: Can. Do you mind if I jump in for a second? Have you considered like robotics teams in your area cause? There are a few like

354
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:50.350
Aditi B: good robotics teams like Frc. Teams that I can think of. I think they're school affiliated, but you might be able to join them, and if you're not part of the high school.

355
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.210
Aditi B: and you can get, like, you know.

356
00:31:52.260 --> 00:32:01.519
Aditi B: a software leadership role or like a technical leadership role within those teams, and that might also be useful for both leadership and for building your computer science skills.

357
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.439
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah, I think that my school does have some robotics teams.

358
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:19.950
Aditi B: Okay? Then I'd highly recommend like looking into those and joining those. It's a decent time commitment, but also great for leadership, great for recs cause. There's lots of mentors usually on those teams who are from industry. And then there's also great like technical skills. You can learn from the club. So

359
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.560
Aditi B: right, yeah, highly recommend robot.

360
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.360
Ananyaa Srivastava: Awesome.

361
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:30.209
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay, I'm sorry, Aditi, that's the thing. She used to be part of a robotics club while she was in middle school.

362
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:42.329
Ananyaa Srivastava: but somehow the dynamics within the team was a bit weird, and then the time commitment was like, you know, 3 3 days a week, and then all those extended hours, and somehow.

363
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:53.129
Ananyaa Srivastava: I ended up not really doing actual robotics there very often. But then, if you're part of a bigger team that will always be there. You have to fight it out

364
00:32:53.260 --> 00:33:00.670
Ananyaa Srivastava: somehow. It doesn't. Yeah, it it was a bit, you know, like, you know, all the girls in the team versus all the boys in the team

365
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.890
Ananyaa Srivastava: and.

366
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.050
Aditi B: Oh, yeah, I can imagine.

367
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.360
Ananyaa Srivastava: Was, yeah, so.

368
00:33:06.522 --> 00:33:11.310
Aditi B: But I think if I'm assuming you did ftc, or something in middle school

369
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.409
Aditi B: with like a 15 ish person team.

370
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:16.619
Ananyaa Srivastava: Sorry could you?

371
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:23.210
Aditi B: Did you do like ftc, or like, what robotics did you do in middle school? Okay. So I feel like the Frc

372
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:52.680
Aditi B: set, like the mindset or like the the community, is slightly different, because usually parents aren't the mentors for the team. It's like external and then students end up having better leadership roles like upperclassmen. So there's not too much of like a parent influence on things. And then if you find another like girl in the on the team who's older then, like it's great to like, just connect with them. And then you can kind of like, you know, go under their wing and then build up to maybe a leadership role next year. So.

373
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.080
Ananyaa Srivastava: Separate.

374
00:33:53.439 --> 00:34:03.879
Aditi B: And plus the season only starts in January for Frc, so you are not behind in anything. They'll probably be starting training and stuff over the fall.

375
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.830
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay.

376
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.010
Aditi B: So, yeah.

377
00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:14.300
Jenny Duan: And then, yeah, are you interested in robotics at all? Or like the hardware side of computer science? Or are you mostly interested in like the software side?

378
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:20.680
Ananyaa Srivastava: I think that the hardware side of robotics is pretty cool, but I never got the chance to really learn it.

379
00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.770
Ananyaa Srivastava: but I would be interested in it.

380
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:37.250
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Do you see? In your opinion, do you think it's like you have enough time to join Frc. To make a contribution starting sophomore year, or would it? I? I don't know much about frc, so do you think that that's feasible? Or do you think, like most people start from freshman year earlier?

381
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:57.029
Aditi B: It really depends on your team. I was doing robotics like I did Ftc. As well. I started in the 5th grade with Fll, and I joined my team freshman year, and I ended up getting soft relief by sophomore year. But that was Covid for me. I think it really depends. A lot of students do join sophomore year, and as long as you're like joining as an underclassman, then you really have a good you know.

382
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.389
Aditi B: a reasonable

383
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:13.240
Aditi B: possibility of becoming leadership before, like Junior or Senior year. And also, I guess, with Ft. Frc. Teams you can kind of make leadership roles. So there's like, you know, there can be a software lead. But if there's enough students involved, usually they'll open up extra positions. So there's a software like

384
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:20.920
Aditi B: scheduling lead, and they'll break it up to a software technical lead. And you know, they'll just keep breaking up the kind of the leadership

385
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.130
Aditi B: roles. So.

386
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.119
Ananyaa Srivastava: Like smaller units, right within a.

387
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.220
Aditi B: Yeah, yeah.

388
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.250
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay.

389
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.579
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

390
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:34.869
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah, you'll you'll have to try and see. Look around who's doing it? And like, go and talk to them. Yeah.

391
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:59.999
Aditi B: Yeah, but I'll admit it is like a huge time commitment. I spend like 18 HA week on my team. You know, like 4 days a week, and then Saturdays. So it really depends. Like, if you have, are ready to commit that much time. But then again, it's like in the evenings, and usually Frc. Teams are a little bit better about like time management. They let you go by 10 Pm. They don't make you stay overnight until, like 2 Am. Like Ftc. Teams sometimes do.

392
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.630
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

393
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.660
Ananyaa Srivastava: also.

394
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:01.979
Jenny Duan: Thank you.

395
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.730
Ananyaa Srivastava: I would say that requires a lot of, you know.

396
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:13.300
Ananyaa Srivastava: interpersonal communication and reaching out to people and talking to people which I feel Anania really needs to work on.

397
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:24.530
Aditi B: Yeah, that would be a great place to work on like leadership and interpersonal skill development. So that's that's another reason why I brought up robotics, because that's, you know, leadership and technical in one. Go.

398
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.279
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah, even to get a position. You know, you have to have, you know, like basic stuff.

399
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:34.239
Ananyaa Srivastava: You know, skills, how you reach out to people, how you talk to people, how you wiggle, you weigh in

400
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:42.400
Ananyaa Srivastava: right that I mean, if I would go around and do it for you. That's not the point right now in high school? Yeah. So.

401
00:36:42.400 --> 00:37:04.940
Jenny Duan: Alright, I think I'm gonna step in here and yeah. And then, yeah, I'm curious, like, is this something that you would be interested in? Or is this something that you wouldn't find enjoyable at all? Because I think, with the whole approach to college applications. And you know, activities, we want to do things that you find that you personally appreciate. So is this something that you think you'd be interested in? If not, we can just move on. If so, I'll write it down.

402
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:08.240
Ananyaa Srivastava: If I could manage the time commitment, then I would be interested.

403
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:15.549
Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm a little bit concerned about the time commitment here, especially starting it. And trying to fight your way through a hierarchy. In

404
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:40.479
Jenny Duan: sophomore year. And so I think that I'm gonna write it down. But I think let's explore what some other alternatives would look like that. I think the goal here is to not like necessarily push through a hierarchy like trying to grind your way up, but rather like create opportunities, are a good fit for you where you can immediately step into leadership roles, just because time is like a little bit short, not too short, since you're still a sophomore. But I'd love to find areas where you can have a direct

405
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.900
Jenny Duan: influence without having to like compete with other people or like.

406
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:58.990
Jenny Duan: put in just a lot of hours with little impact. Because I think with activities, we want to maximize like your hours to impact ability and try to give you like the most impact with, like the smallest amount of time. Because, obviously, like, we want you to live your life.

407
00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:22.848
Jenny Duan: too. And like, I'm sure you have other hobbies outside of school and dedicating time to those, too. So yeah, and also feel free like anytime. If I suggest something that you're like, oh, like this is cool, but maybe, like I don't super wanna do this and let me know, or if I say something, and I tell you maybe this isn't a good fit, and you're like, Oh, I really wanna try this like also let me know. This is all about you, and like what's a good fit for you.

408
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:33.230
Jenny Duan: so yeah, another thing I saw that was super cool on your profile is this, Karate? Advanced Brown Belt. Can you tell me a bit more about Karate, and how long you've been involved with this.

409
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.740
Ananyaa Srivastava: I've been doing it since I was 7 or 8. Right?

410
00:38:37.625 --> 00:38:41.380
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah. 9, no, yeah. 9. No.

411
00:38:42.245 --> 00:38:42.700
Jenny Duan: Wow!

412
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:43.550
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

413
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:46.110
Ananyaa Srivastava: I, like it.

414
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.659
Jenny Duan: What do you like about Karate.

415
00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:48.870
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well.

416
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.950
Ananyaa Srivastava: it's good

417
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:55.850
Ananyaa Srivastava: form of exercise, and I just like the sport, I guess.

418
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:56.850
Ananyaa Srivastava: Built it.

419
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.460
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

420
00:38:58.068 --> 00:39:26.340
Jenny Duan: I I know I I like martial arts, too. I took an intro to martial arts course at Stanford, and it was super fun. I like learned a little bit of Karate. I'm really bad, but it was fun to like learn more about the like the positions, and like the history behind it. One thing that I'm that I'm thinking about, that could be really cool with just Karate in general and movement is since you like robotics, and you're interested in the hardware. I'm curious like. I know, that the University of Washington

421
00:39:26.648 --> 00:39:49.490
Jenny Duan: is pretty close to where you are in Spanish, and they might have some cool labs that do research on like movement, and translating like physical movement into robotics with applications into like physical therapy, or like simulating humanoid robots like, I think that would be really cool. If you're interested in robotics at all. Is that something that sounds interesting to you like learning how to make robots move like humans.

422
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:50.035
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

423
00:39:50.580 --> 00:40:05.239
Jenny Duan: Yeah. And I think like doing something like that could connect really well to you know your love for Karate and sport and movement, and like trying to translate. You know that into robotic movement to like either, I could see applications on like helping people rehabilitate, for

424
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:28.640
Jenny Duan: with like muscular diseases, or helping people recover from injury by modeling it through robots, or creating robots that can help, like elderly people, do complete tasks and give them like more autonomy. I think that would be like a really cool direction. I feel like, since you said you're more quiet. Like, maybe a research environment could be good for you, because then you're collaborating with a lot of people. But you don't have to like fight for leadership, because

425
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:38.030
Jenny Duan: everyone's kind of doing their own thing, but still, like collaborating with each other, and you can have charge of your own like projects in your own time. Have you explored any research before.

426
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:39.080
Ananyaa Srivastava: No.

427
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:55.349
Jenny Duan: No, okay. I think that could be something to think about, especially because you're close to the University of Washington, and you have so many resources there. So I think that could be something to look more into. And then I also see, like chess tournaments. How long have you been doing that for.

428
00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:56.649
Ananyaa Srivastava: Just a few months.

429
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.169
Jenny Duan: and like, how what got you into that.

430
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.499
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, my dad plays a lot of chess and.

431
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:06.310
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

432
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:08.370
Ananyaa Srivastava: Mostly I like the game. It's fun.

433
00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:11.369
Jenny Duan: What do you? What do you like about it?

434
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:13.160
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, it's

435
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.290
Ananyaa Srivastava: hmm. Well.

436
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.599
Ananyaa Srivastava: it's like

437
00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:24.159
Ananyaa Srivastava: I like the way that you have to plan things out. Think like 3 or 4 moves in advance.

438
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:27.479
Ananyaa Srivastava: It's just good mental stimulation.

439
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.040
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Do you have a rating in chess?

440
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.510
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

441
00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.960
Jenny Duan: What's your rating.

442
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:37.930
Ananyaa Srivastava: 300. Not that good. I only participated in like a couple of tournaments.

443
00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.039
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's pretty good. Do you compete with for your school team, or just independently.

444
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.349
Ananyaa Srivastava: I take classes independent of school.

445
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:47.852
Jenny Duan: They take classes independently. That's awesome.

446
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.390
Jenny Duan: And

447
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:55.089
Jenny Duan: have you watched like the Queen's gambit? That's the only thing that I know about that I know about chess, but.

448
00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.409
Ananyaa Srivastava: Alright, your voice cut out a little. Could you repeat that.

449
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:03.029
Jenny Duan: I said, have you watched? The Queen's gambit? That's like the only thing I know about chess. But.

450
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:08.080
Ananyaa Srivastava: I've heard about it. But no, I have seen it. It's I love that movie yeah.

451
00:42:08.565 --> 00:42:09.510
Ananyaa Srivastava: yeah, you should.

452
00:42:09.925 --> 00:42:10.340
Jenny Duan: Fun?

453
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:18.930
Jenny Duan: yeah. And then one thing I actually found really quickly, right now is like, Have you heard of the company? Nvidia?

454
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:19.990
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

455
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:42.439
Jenny Duan: They actually have a pretty cool lab that they just opened in Seattle. It's like a robotics research lab in Seattle. And I looked at their like I looked at their internship program, and it looks like they have a lot of like college interns. And so I think if they have college interns, they might be willing to take high school interns, or you might be able to connect with some members of their lab to like help out. So

456
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:53.060
Jenny Duan: that's 1 thing I like, we'll talk more about this during our more in depth session next week, but like as a preview like doing something related to Nvidia's lab or research lab at Uw. Could be interesting for you.

457
00:42:53.379 --> 00:43:01.470
Jenny Duan: And then, finally, the last extracurricular I see that you have is called Model United Nations delegate is this through school, and how long have you been doing that before?

458
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:09.389
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, I started off through my middle school, but this year I have been doing it on my own. It started in 7th grade.

459
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.490
Jenny Duan: Through school, right.

460
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.420
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

461
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.180
Jenny Duan: And what what kind of got you into this.

462
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:16.920
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well.

463
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.290
Ananyaa Srivastava: there was a Humanities Club in my middle school.

464
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:25.020
Ananyaa Srivastava: and I just joined that club, and I found model United Nations through that.

465
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:51.279
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense. So I see that you're doing a lot of a lot of different things. So you're doing some technical things. You're learning chess. You're learning a model, you and you're doing, Karate, something that stands out to me about your profile right now is it seems like you're doing like a lot of really cool activities. It seems like you have good interest in computer science. It does seem like your profile is a little bit cookie cutter right now. Do you know what I mean when I say cookie Cutter.

466
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.180
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes. Yes. Okay, that's.

467
00:43:53.180 --> 00:44:15.620
Jenny Duan: I think one thing that stands out to me is like, probably a lot of people in your area are like doing similar things to you and like, that's not a bad thing where everyone in in high school kind of starts out with doing the same thing until they eventually figure out their path. So what I want to like kind of dive into right now is what we can do to make your profile very unique and stand out a bit more, and that will look like doing things that are outside the box and things that are special and

468
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:37.489
Jenny Duan: important to you. Could you tell me a bit about like what you're interested in outside of school. It could be anything. It doesn't have to be anything academic related. For example, you could tell me like you like hiking, you can tell me you love playing video games. You love cooking like anything it can be. If you have any really niche interest. I just want to learn more about what you're passionate, about what you spend your time binging Youtube videos on or thinking about in your free time.

469
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.010
Ananyaa Srivastava: I like gardening.

470
00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:42.670
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's cool.

471
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:43.660
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

472
00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:45.210
Jenny Duan: To hit.

473
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.199
Ananyaa Srivastava: Are you telling me more

474
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:48.820
Ananyaa Srivastava: gardening? Hiking?

475
00:44:50.505 --> 00:44:53.474
Ananyaa Srivastava: What else, Jenny? She's been helping

476
00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:01.859
Ananyaa Srivastava: son of my friend my friend's son with the reading comprehension like a tutor.

477
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.690
Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. Yes.

478
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:07.849
Ananyaa Srivastava: I mean I don't know how I thought. It's something that I should mention.

479
00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:16.850
Jenny Duan: Yeah, no, totally I want to know, like, how you spend your time, how? What else do you do? So you keep a garden. What do you like to garden? Vegetables, fruits, flowers.

480
00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:19.119
Ananyaa Srivastava: Flowers. Specifically, a lot of roses.

481
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:27.339
Jenny Duan: Roses. Portland is the City of Roses, so I love roses. I think that's awesome. Gardening roses! What else.

482
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.220
Ananyaa Srivastava: I like reading.

483
00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.170
Ananyaa Srivastava: what else?

484
00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:43.182
Ananyaa Srivastava: I think, Chris, food, you are a bit of a foodie, yeah, I, like food,

485
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:50.289
Jenny Duan: What do you like about food? Do you like cooking? Do you like like eating out like, do you like learning about restaurants?

486
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.189
Ananyaa Srivastava: Eating out, mostly.

487
00:45:53.180 --> 00:46:07.189
Jenny Duan: Do? Do you have like? How much do you like eating out like I'm a big foodie, too, like, how much do you like? Do you like learning about like how food is cooked? Do you like following chefs like, do you like like writing about food, or like, what? Or do you just.

488
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.570
Ananyaa Srivastava: 2.

489
00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:07.970
Jenny Duan: And appreciate.

490
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:17.989
Ananyaa Srivastava: I don't follow chefs, but I do like learning about how food is prepared, and or or sampling a new kind of a cuisine, a new cuisine something that's

491
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.379
Ananyaa Srivastava: she hasn't tried before. Yeah, trying new things.

492
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.220
Jenny Duan: Yeah, so a couple of things that this is

493
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:33.460
Jenny Duan: bringing to my mind right away is 1st of all like, you like stem right. Do you like chemistry at all, or no.

494
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.350
Ananyaa Srivastava: Well, I, yeah, I like chemistry.

495
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.249
Jenny Duan: So food. Science. Oh, go ahead.

496
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:40.910
Ananyaa Srivastava: Book.

497
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.870
Ananyaa Srivastava: So she did. Ybtc, you be the chemist during the Covid time.

498
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.710
Ananyaa Srivastava: and she did pretty well. I think she got

499
00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:56.270
Ananyaa Srivastava: second or 3, rd highest grades, or or points in the district at that point in time, in that competition. Yeah.

500
00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:08.087
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's awesome. And I think, like right now, one thing that I'm also noticing is like you do a lot of academic competitions. This is amazing. But we also want to show impact in different ways.

501
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:28.339
Jenny Duan: So we want to have, like a diversified way of showing your impact and your involvement. So that's competitions, but also like tangible impact that you make in your community in the passion areas that we have, we are discussing. And one thing I think, that could be really cool for you is to learn more about food, science and what that looks like, because like food. Science is

502
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:56.690
Jenny Duan: the the science behind? Like, okay, why do we have to boil this food at a certain temperature, like when we cookies making cookies or baking is basically an act of science, like putting together different ingredients, watching their chemical compounds and like kind of expanding that like food, science can help us create less waste when we eat it can create more sustainable processes of making food, especially like I'm mostly vegetarian. I don't really like fake meat, but I know, like food scientists. They make that fake meat. They're making more sustainable choices for a planet. And like

503
00:47:56.690 --> 00:48:04.129
Jenny Duan: learning more about the science behind. Food can be like a really interesting thing for you to do, to connect with the community, to develop, to develop, maybe, like

504
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:15.159
Jenny Duan: less waste or better ways to process food or more sustainable choices. So that's something that we could look more into. Another thing is, I just found out that there's a Seattle Rose Society.

505
00:48:15.479 --> 00:48:18.570
Jenny Duan: Are you aware of this? Are you familiar with it?

506
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.639
Ananyaa Srivastava: I was not.

507
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:43.099
Jenny Duan: Okay. I think that like gardening is a super unique thing, and you should like lean more into that, because at every school, and especially at the schools that you want to apply it to like. They're looking for people that can bring something different and something special to their community like they're not just looking for a billion people who do say science Olympiad, or mock trial or something. They're looking for people who have really unique and diverse and different interests, and I think, like

508
00:48:43.520 --> 00:49:13.369
Jenny Duan: learning about flowers, and like trying to be involved with like a rose. Society can be a really good way to connect with the community and can teach you a lot about, I imagine, like interacting with people from all different ages, and being able to share your passion for gardening with the public, which I think could be really cool. Something that I can imagine you going from you could something I can imagine you leading is maybe like an initiative where you like, educate people about roses like, especially kids. Or you emphasize like the importance of having community gardens which

509
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:31.738
Jenny Duan: you know, I could see, like you growing a community garden that then you take that food, and you like either donated that to like a shelter or like a food pantry, or you do something with your love for food, with like your passion for gardening, too? Like something that combines this interest together. I think that would be really cool.

510
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:47.140
Jenny Duan: and this is just like me going on a tangent. But like these are all ideas that I think you could take on for hiking do you go hiking? Really often? I know Mount Rainier is like pretty close to you. I hiked that couple of weeks ago, when I was still in the Pacific Northwest. It's beautiful.

511
00:49:48.606 --> 00:49:56.899
Ananyaa Srivastava: Honestly, I've dropped off on hiking lately because I had an injury to my ankle, and that took a while to recover.

512
00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.560
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

513
00:49:59.050 --> 00:49:59.680
Jenny Duan: That's a good.

514
00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.899
Ananyaa Srivastava: On an average in the summer.

515
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.499
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay? Ish, okay? Yeah.

516
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.700
Jenny Duan: Yeah, cool. And then another question I have is like.

517
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:16.279
Jenny Duan: in your free time. What do you catch yourself thinking about? The most like, you know, when you're not thinking about anything. What do you think about.

518
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:23.850
Ananyaa Srivastava: Usually I go to books and different scenarios for scenes and books I've read lately.

519
00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.859
Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, what are you reading right now? Any recommendations?

520
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.349
Ananyaa Srivastava: Project. Hail Mary. I just started.

521
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:34.650
Jenny Duan: Hill, Mary. Okay, I think I've heard of that. That's like pretty. Is that popular right now?

522
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.450
Ananyaa Srivastava: Oh, I know it's popular, like

523
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.959
Ananyaa Srivastava: in my friend Group. I don't know about outside of that, but.

524
00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.800
Jenny Duan: Oh, Andy, wire. Okay.

525
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.860
Ananyaa Srivastava: Old, so I'm guessing. Yes.

526
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:52.739
Jenny Duan: I read the Martian. I love the Martian. I love science fiction. I haven't read Project Hail Mary yet, but it looks really good.

527
00:50:53.340 --> 00:51:12.200
Jenny Duan: Okay, so I think we've covered a lot of material today. I think the biggest goal. And what I want to focus our next session in is coming from these interests that we talked about. I'm gonna prepare. We're gonna prepare. Our team is gonna prepare some like specific extracurricular ideas that we want to help you grow from, and like sort of shape.

528
00:51:12.482 --> 00:51:35.379
Jenny Duan: Your interest and help balance them a bit. I think that's our goal is like shifting you from a more cookie cutter profile to diving deeper into those things that from the surface level other people might not know about you. For example, your passion for gardening, your love for reading, cooking, I mean sorry eating good food, and like combining all that into something that's a little bit deeper, because ultimately, like a college application, or all the steps along

529
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:52.469
Jenny Duan: along the way, for your application is a way for you to explore like who you are, and hopefully show that to someone else. I'm just wondering, like as you approach the season of your life, like, what are some of your concerns, and like? What are some things that you struggle with, or you might want extra support or clarification on.

530
00:51:53.073 --> 00:51:58.909
Jenny Duan: Now, it's like more of a question. Answer session for you and your parents, where you can go a little deeper into your thoughts.

531
00:52:01.085 --> 00:52:04.634
Ananyaa Srivastava: Jenny. The areas that she needs to improve on my take is

532
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:14.050
Ananyaa Srivastava: She? She does speak well, but she needs to learn to speak more freely, I to me it feels like she's holding back a lot.

533
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:18.080
Ananyaa Srivastava: I I want her to be a more confident, more

534
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:26.609
Ananyaa Srivastava: a more confident speaker, and to be able to say, instead of monosyllabic answers, to be able to

535
00:52:27.149 --> 00:52:32.419
Ananyaa Srivastava: chat fluidly, more confidently, more fluidly, not holding back so much.

536
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:46.770
Ananyaa Srivastava: Number 2 I mentioned earlier also. Okay, agreed that she's quiet and sort of introverted. But you need basic minimum interpersonal skills to be able to be successful anywhere.

537
00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.549
Ananyaa Srivastava: Those 2 for me, for example, you know that

538
00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:55.240
Ananyaa Srivastava: B. That she got in her English

539
00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.750
Ananyaa Srivastava: was because she

540
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:02.440
Ananyaa Srivastava: somehow she was very, very hesitant about reaching out to the teacher.

541
00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:14.380
Ananyaa Srivastava: She had submitted the assignment, but she had to communicate to the teacher. She did communicate once, but when it I feel it's too important a matter to let go of that. Then, you know, you're not

542
00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:21.180
Ananyaa Srivastava: reaching out to the teacher one more time, you know that. Hey? I submitted my assignment. Can you please improve my grades?

543
00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:23.910
Ananyaa Srivastava: Or or I mean.

544
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:30.400
Ananyaa Srivastava: yeah, those are self advocacy. Yeah, that was the term that I was raised that I was looking for.

545
00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:33.450
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah,

546
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:57.710
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that starts. Now let's make sure that you send that follow up email to your counselor on Monday morning. Okay, you're gonna write this down in your notes app, or however, you take notes like right, send this email on Monday morning. Ask them to bump you to physics, too. That can be one small baby step goal. You're definitely qualified, I think sometimes it's easy to like, disqualify ourselves. And we do this all the time when we think like, oh, like.

547
00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:12.699
Jenny Duan: maybe I'm not good enough for something, and like I don't deserve to be there. But, like you already took ap physics, one you already got 4, which is a great score. So you deserve to be an Ap. Physics. 2. And you want to put yourself there, and if all it takes is one email. You've got it totally within your reach.

548
00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:18.199
Jenny Duan: So let's start with that. And then, yeah, what are your kind of like goals, or like, what are you

549
00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:27.150
Jenny Duan: like? Would be concerned about? Or are there any questions that you have regarding like college applications, or your next steps that you would like to clarify or talk about

550
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.110
Jenny Duan: right.

551
00:54:28.574 --> 00:54:35.080
Ananyaa Srivastava: One concern that I have is probably not quite time management, but more efficiency

552
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:41.079
Ananyaa Srivastava: cause I I don't feel like I have a lot of time management, too. I get tired easily.

553
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:46.880
Jenny Duan: Yeah, you got tired easy, like, physically tired or like, it's hard to hold your attention and focus.

554
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.109
Ananyaa Srivastava: Physically tired.

555
00:54:48.110 --> 00:55:12.559
Jenny Duan: Okay, this is actually something that I think I would encourage you. To get your labs checked at a doctor. This is like this is just personal advice, like not Iv, not like medical advice, but like personally, this used to happen to me a lot, and like turns out I had a vitamin d deficiency and an iron deficiency. So I would actually like, this is something that maybe isn't a cause by you like, just try especially living in the Pacific Northwest like vitamin d deficiencies

556
00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:22.519
Jenny Duan: common. So try to. I would get a blood test, actually get your thyroid, and then your like vitamins. Check to see if you need anything, because a lot of the times like, if you just tell yourself to sleep more like

557
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:25.889
Jenny Duan: from my experience. Having been there like that doesn't really help like

558
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:38.719
Jenny Duan: if something's not helping like, maybe that's just your body needs more nutrients and like in the Pacific Northwest. We know it rains all the time. We don't get sun like that's 1 main reason, or like iron deficiency is also really common. So try to get that checked too.

559
00:55:38.985 --> 00:55:57.310
Jenny Duan: And then, with the actual, like, more time, management, aspect, and not like the physical aspect. We can work through some exercises later on to like schedule your time. Make sure that you're balanced, and like we have some strategies to help you with that, so that we can do but the medical side I would just like get check off and try to get that figured out first.st

560
00:55:57.310 --> 00:56:02.529
Ananyaa Srivastava: You have an an annual exam coming up right. Yes, please bring it up, because I won't be there.

561
00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:12.029
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be a good time to bring that up, because that's outside your control. And that's a pretty easy fix, too. It's not like a self discipline issue. That's just like a health thing.

562
00:56:12.596 --> 00:56:14.660
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Any other concerns.

563
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:23.790
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah. Time management. Also, apart from getting tired, I feel, because I kept hearing in the freshman year that the course is very easy. It's very easy.

564
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.750
Ananyaa Srivastava: When it came to homework a lot of the time she was all over the place.

565
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:36.419
Ananyaa Srivastava: you know. If you feel it's easy you should be able to finish it way ahead of time and not like running against a very tight deadline over and over. Yeah.

566
00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:38.370
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Totally.

567
00:56:39.204 --> 00:56:42.350
Jenny Duan: What about your parents? Anything else that comes to mind.

568
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:49.350
Ananyaa Srivastava: I think I think it's you know this is. This is a wonderful step. I think most of it is.

569
00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:51.109
Ananyaa Srivastava: You know.

570
00:56:51.690 --> 00:57:19.777
Ananyaa Srivastava: our lack of overall, you know, knowledge and process and structure. And I feel very confident with this session alone that that you are bringing quite a lot of structure and knowledge. Into it we come, as we said earlier, we come from Indian background. You you write G, you get into it. You are done. It's very like, you know. Yes, no kind of thing you do poorly. You don't get done so this is, this is, this requires a game plan. And I I really

571
00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:35.210
Ananyaa Srivastava: enjoyed this discussion, and it gives me quite a lot of confidence also that, having gone through all of that, both you, Jenny and Aditi, you would provide the insight and structure, and help guide all of us into this journey. Thank you.

572
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:36.390
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I, I.

573
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:38.200
Ananyaa Srivastava: Some of the ideas that you brought up.

574
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:42.869
Ananyaa Srivastava: and they were amazing, like, we are right here, and we had no idea so.

575
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.100
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

576
00:57:44.670 --> 00:58:03.059
Jenny Duan: One thing I can easily see, like you taking part in. And and I know we'll we have another session. So we'll go deeper into this. But, like even with the Seattle Rose Society, like, I know that they have volunteer opportunities like maybe you could volunteer and like give tours in their garden. And that would be a cool way to like talk about something you're really passionate about, but also like.

577
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:19.409
Jenny Duan: learn how to interact with people in a very casual setting, and also improving like your community service aspect of your profile. But anyways, we'll go deeper into this in our next session, so no worries about thinking about it. Now, Amadici, do you have anything to add about any ideas that you have or anything you think Anania should be aware of.

578
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:32.750
Aditi B: No, I thought you had a great wrap up. Those were great ideas, too. But yeah, I guess. Keep looking out into your clubs and like, Keep keep doing what you're doing because you're doing a lot of great things. And as we progress we'll try to. You know.

579
00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.950
Aditi B: Streamline, what you're working on.

580
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.170
Ananyaa Srivastava: Okay.

581
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.440
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Siraj, any final words?

582
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:53.002
Ivylevel: I mean, you know, I didn't have enough time to actually talk to both parents. Actually, it's been a while since I also talked to you spoke to your mom, but I think just to set a few things here right. The stage. I'm glad that you were able to get the essence of it. I mean, basically, I'm talking to parents here.

583
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:54.020
Ananyaa Srivastava: Gotcha.

584
00:58:54.020 --> 00:59:00.140
Ivylevel: Why is this important at the end of the day? Why am I like doing this? And you know, really, for people like myself

585
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:08.890
Ivylevel: is fundamentally for those reasons. You know, the thing that really excites me about the college prep in the Us. Is really those foundational skills

586
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:15.800
Ivylevel: that unfortunately cannot be acquired by going to a boot camp or a meditation camp or a psychotherapy camp.

587
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:25.430
Ivylevel: Right? How do you change a girl? And you know, like I'm I'm sure that probably Jenny is a witness she has seen my own daughter transform. We have seen many girls transform.

588
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:39.580
Ivylevel: and the reason is that this whole framework is such a beautiful thing. So really, what I want you to see, and this thing will happen, whether, like, you know, if done in the proper way with the right strategies and the right guidance.

589
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:58.079
Ivylevel: It will happen because there's no other way of doing this. If you really want to stand out and you're committed. You will have to say no to 1,000 things right. See, there was a lot of question here, and I don't want you to be overbrended with it, right? Clubs and activities, all that this was really kind of to see. Like, you know, what are you currently doing? What's your status scope?

590
00:59:58.170 --> 01:00:03.220
Ivylevel: You know how far are you stretched? And and the cookie cutter is is actually a real thing.

591
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:07.719
Ivylevel: And it's 1 of the easiest way to. Actually, it's the most prohibitive way to prepare

592
01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:25.539
Ivylevel: right. I'm not saying that as a cookie cutter you won't be able to get in might be one of the top most platinum Olympiad winner, you know, in the entire world might have a chance to get in or a research paper. But that was so novel that probably you know Sam Altman, you know, hired him for his company, or something like that, or her company. What is important is.

593
01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:31.079
Ivylevel: you know, especially the second part. You see like how there was this kind of pivot towards the end.

594
01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:43.860
Ivylevel: where your community causes your gardening. See, that is what is interesting. And this is fundamentally something that I have missed it as a parent coming from the background where no one actually cared the admission offices did not care

595
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.280
Ivylevel: who the person behind that application, or that paper was.

596
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.160
Ananyaa Srivastava: Right.

597
01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:55.000
Ivylevel: And the only thing they care here is who is the person, the personality behind that application package.

598
01:00:55.140 --> 01:01:03.640
Ivylevel: you know. Probably your dad knows it right, you know. Let's work backwards like Amazon. Right? You have this release right coming up. And you know, Alan, you are getting into Stanford

599
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:10.729
Ivylevel: now. They are reading your paper like your your essay or narrative. The 1st thing that manifests in your application is probably 1 min of reading.

600
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:16.310
Ivylevel: And what memories are you leaving them behind when they're reading like 1,000 applications on a daily basis?

601
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.990
Ananyaa Srivastava: Correct.

602
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:24.429
Ivylevel: Let's say, like one another girl who's done one who's done XYZ. Debate club X club, y club.

603
01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.010
Ivylevel: or that girl

604
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.560
Ivylevel: who also used to do gardening and made a huge food science impact.

605
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:30.859
Ivylevel: Think about it.

606
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:37.300
Ivylevel: It is how uniquely and interesting! And you know the best part of it. Your authenticity is what will help you.

607
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:44.169
Ivylevel: so do not think of your kind of interest to be. That is your sweet spot and strength.

608
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:47.359
Ivylevel: Do not, and I'm I'm being very honest, a parent to parent chat

609
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:59.710
Ivylevel: parents. We are under a lot of pressure, right? We are looking at 1560, 1580, and then Jenny knows that there is a Asian ritual month after month, where parents actually take their kids to just boost 10 points in sat.

610
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.680
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah.

611
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.530
Ivylevel: Much a waste of return of investment. Your parents know it is about

612
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:09.899
Ivylevel: really spending time on the things that will give you the biggest bang for the buck return of investment.

613
01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:18.119
Ivylevel: So there will be a lot of elimination. By the way, okay, and this time management is a woman thing in our program. That's why the weekly execution is important.

614
01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:25.820
Ivylevel: The 1st session will be this 1 68 h framework, right where we will try to take a stake. We'll say no to 1,000 things, and that's perfectly fine.

615
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:36.709
Ivylevel: We should not be running after everything. We have to be smart about it, and we need to pick up and define things that are uniquely yours that needs to have a DNA. So the whole point is anything and everything you do.

616
01:02:36.780 --> 01:03:06.390
Ivylevel: You should enjoy it. That's when the transformation happens. Because remember, the expectation here is to do this, for you know, eventually, in the college application, there will be a. A. Some quantitative day, some quantitative data for this qualitative work. And one of the quantitative data point is, how many hours and how many F. How much. What kind of an effort and tenure have you put on a particular activity, and tell me one thing, the only way to put a dedicated time and effort on something. If it if you truly love and you're passionate about it.

617
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.069
Ivylevel: it's the Indian 3 idiot philosophy, that's what it is.

618
01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.110
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes. Yeah.

619
01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:13.849
Ivylevel: Do that right. So what I want you to do is

620
01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:19.769
Ivylevel: subjectivity. Anania is going to be your secret sauce. There's no other secret sauce.

621
01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:21.889
Ivylevel: The more you hold your stories

622
01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:27.230
Ivylevel: the more, and you know what this is. Precisely the narrative that every time you do something there is

623
01:03:27.489 --> 01:03:38.269
Ivylevel: and you know Aditya and Jenny feel free to kind of drop. I know you guys have a hard stop, you know. I'll just spend some 4, 5, 4 min just to set the stage, because I might not be able to join the next sessions. So

624
01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.540
Ivylevel: thanks a lot, Jenny. Thanks a lot. Aditi.

625
01:03:41.126 --> 01:03:41.999
Ivylevel: Thank you.

626
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.200
Jenny Duan: Thank you. Thank you.

627
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.179
Ivylevel: So I I really want to set the stage here right, like, you know.

628
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:55.070
Ivylevel: quantitative accomplishments, winning competitions. It is not a checklist. Remove this from your mind.

629
01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:04.410
Ivylevel: you know, and I'm talking to you as a you know, as a dad here, like you know, who has gone through this journey multiple times. I that is what actually causes a lot of unnecessary stress on kids.

630
01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:14.029
Ivylevel: There is no reason for you to. Actually again, I'm not saying that you should not get into a robotics if it's an overcrowded. And you see that's precisely what Jenny said.

631
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:22.049
Ivylevel: This is our whole strategy. Why do you really go after a crowd where your chances of you know, getting the return of investment is really low.

632
01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:32.729
Ivylevel: So you need to carve your own path, your unique path right? And we, what we'll do is we'll try to figure out, you know, things and opportunities and game plan for you that is uniquely yours.

633
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:47.810
Ivylevel: And that also actually is optimized for you to win and succeed at top national levels and international levels and group and impact. So what will happen is you will love that cause. You will love gardening. You will love probably some, but it has to be woven with

634
01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:55.689
Ivylevel: your skills, your your subject matter, and your community impact and your passion, probably for girls, probably for some area.

635
01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:13.569
Ivylevel: What it what it will do is it will bring you out from that kind of you will feel more confident because you will own it. You will all see you don't need a title to be a leader. And yeah, that's what I'm saying, and I would say this to my daughter, too, and I've seen that transformation, and she's a gangster now. I tell that all the time I said, you know, I don't know what you were 2 years ago, and you're a gangster now.

636
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:19.650
Ivylevel: because she's literally like, you know, like transformed. And and the reason why that happens is

637
01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:26.460
Ivylevel: you need to pursue things that you're passionate about, make an impact. The community that you love. So be very authentic in whatever you're discussing.

638
01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:30.080
Ivylevel: And the job that our team is really sitting here with

639
01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:33.579
Ivylevel: is to really give you a framework

640
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:51.919
Ivylevel: and give you ideas and guide you to really build something which is uniquely yours that you should enjoy doing. Okay? And so don't get into the rat race. You know I'm I know it's very easy, like, you know, don't let these things bother you. If there are 15 guys who are competing at different levels, and they are completely dominating the robotics.

641
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:56.650
Ivylevel: Don't worry about it. That's not. That's not what will help someone actually stand out.

642
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:57.280
Ananyaa Srivastava: Right.

643
01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:16.560
Ivylevel: Food science. To me food science is a game changer, like, you know, that is the kind of game changing innings we want. Right? You watch cricket right? We want game changing innings we want. So I think. I I you know, just enjoy this journey and don't you know. Get into a race, because these are

644
01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:24.660
Ivylevel: all I'll tell you is like you need 2 or 3 big ticket items. You need 2 or 3 big ticket items. One is community impact. You need to show a community impact

645
01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:29.440
Ivylevel: which will be a quantitative number to say that you have actually helped

646
01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:48.869
Ivylevel: 10,000 people. You have helped 3,000 people, 5,000 people, and it it could be like in different ways. Right? So that will be your home run. Second thing, you need a passion project that stands out. It could be research, or it could be something that your main. But it cannot just be another project right? It has to be something that also translates into

647
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:58.140
Ivylevel: and impact to the community. Right? So this is. And these things take time. You know, you have to do it with love, care, and effort, and you have to enjoy the journey.

648
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:02.779
Ivylevel: I challenge. I bet you. And I've done this to many parents who we've been helping.

649
01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:25.809
Ivylevel: I absolutely see no reason why an India you cannot transform into a strong leader an outspoken girl, a very confident girl, and time management will happen, because, see, the only and and the only commitment I need from you is this, and I'll be very honest if it doesn't work out. i i i i it's not happened before, but I do not take up students. If the it's not working out for them or their parents right?

650
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:43.029
Ivylevel: We want you to succeed, because your success is also my success. You know we are like, I'm a 3 years old startup. I want more, more and more stars. I'm very picky about the students and parents I bring on board parents all they see parents are committed. I know that. But students, I want their commitment. The only commitment I need from you is this

651
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.379
Ivylevel: consistency, that's it.

652
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:50.190
Ivylevel: That is the skill that will. You have to be consistent.

653
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.960
Ivylevel: and you will be bombarded with 100 things. You go to your school.

654
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Ivylevel: Your your classmate would have raised 15,000 in nonprofit

655
01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:13.490
Ivylevel: that will probably make you restless. Someone else might have won this. You might have gotten a B. My daughter got a B. She converted it into A, and absolutely your mom was right. You have to reach out. You have to show persistence, consistency. See? At the end of the day you know the biggest factor.

656
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:28.739
Ivylevel: I I'll tell you the rubric I'm I'm I'm sure that your dad, probably, and your mom knows the hiring committees. You know they have the rubric in this top tech companies. You know. What is the rubric of top schools? Admissions? The biggest factor is overcoming adversity. Do you know that

657
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:39.309
Ivylevel: over adversity has a relative weightage of 4 on 5? Whereas your special talents only have a weightage of 3 on 5. Think about it!

658
01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:46.309
Ivylevel: If you were a national like, you know, America's got talent singer, you would only be weighted 3 out of 5.

659
01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.200
Ivylevel: But if you were able to show and tell that story and demonstrate how, in a boys heavy club

660
01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:56.110
Ivylevel: of a robotics club where you absolutely had no

661
01:08:56.550 --> 01:09:05.390
Ivylevel: entry, all entry barriers, and in 2 years you changed the game and started your own club and became a leader and impacted 15,000 girls.

662
01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:08.709
Ivylevel: You see, that story is what is needed.

663
01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:33.410
Ivylevel: You know, the kind of people they are requiring is the future leaders of the world they want. They're not looking for experts who are in AI talent and researchers and robotics. Champions might be one or 2 mit, probably some research at some level. They're looking for brilliant like, you know, only academics, students. They need people that if I bring this interesting girl into the class of 2020, 30, or whatever class your class is, gonna be.

664
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:41.520
Ivylevel: you know. How can she come and make an impact in Stanford and then make an impact in the Us and make a global impact in the world.

665
01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:46.230
Ivylevel: So they want people who have demonstrated that trail.

666
01:09:46.359 --> 01:10:08.140
Ivylevel: So how can you demonstrate? You know, I'll tell you one thing. Your biggest asset is your barriers today. Remember this word, and we will talk about this in 2 years time when you prepare your college application, the biggest struggle I have with students who are all straight A's, and you know no B's and no struggles, and they're all like, you know, I've won all the competition. I I we do have students like that, too, the biggest. There's no story.

667
01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:13.820
Ivylevel: There is no story. And I'm like, what story are. We have to struggle to find out.

668
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:20.609
Ivylevel: You know, what barriers did you have? And remember you are from a privileged class at the end of the day, you know, in the gamified system it's a gamified system.

669
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:35.259
Ivylevel: You you you are part of, you know, a a community, and you know, an ethnicity. That is actually, you know, a, not a underserved segment. Unfortunately. So you have to be really different.

670
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:44.329
Ivylevel: So enjoy the journey. And I think you know and the other reason I I did not bring it up, but I did see and mention of Bio in in your profile.

671
01:10:44.836 --> 01:10:49.970
Ivylevel: And but mention of journalism. There were a couple of other interest areas. I know it's a lot to cover.

672
01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:57.959
Ivylevel: See? I typically, we typically do not assign a long term head coach, you know, like your primary coach, until we evaluate a few things. So

673
01:10:58.282 --> 01:11:08.080
Ivylevel: that's why I brought in Aditi as well. Now, Aditi is a very stem. Heavy girl, right? She is really like, you see, like she's robotic. She's Isef. She's reach research. She's all stem stem stem.

674
01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:14.969
Ivylevel: Jenny is a very interdisciplinary. And you know Jenny is also a psychologist. You can see the very different approach. Right? So. But she's a head coach.

675
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:15.670
Ananyaa Srivastava: Right, right.

676
01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:16.100
Ivylevel: Yeah.

677
01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:16.539
Ananyaa Srivastava: I'm sorry.

678
01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.490
Ivylevel: Care of that. We do have a lot of bio purchase, too.

679
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:31.129
Ivylevel: So I think what we are gonna do is like, you know, we're gonna look at your game plan in next session. I will ask them to also dig a bit more into bio. And the other thing I want. Also. You know, parents to take away from here is

680
01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:37.899
Ivylevel: 90% of the coaches who are doing Cs today at Stanford. The top school in the world.

681
01:11:38.559 --> 01:11:45.209
Ivylevel: When it comes to Cs actually did no Cs project in their high school, something also that our parents we need to understand.

682
01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.570
Ivylevel: major, not a requirement to get into a school to do a particular major

683
01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.400
Ivylevel: fundamental difference.

684
01:11:53.230 --> 01:12:03.329
Ivylevel: right? Fundamental difference. Jenny is doing Cs. AI and psychology and all that. The only thing she did when she was in high school was all Bio research. She wanted to be a doctor

685
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:19.020
Ivylevel: there. There is a lot of different profiles. Okay? So I think, remove that thing from your mind that. Oh, if I don't do Cs projects and I don't go to Cs boot camps, I won't get into a Cs school absolutely wrong. Same applies with Berkeley. Same applies. You can even go in as an undecided student.

686
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:32.540
Ivylevel: so I think, don't have that kind of, you know, biases and the weight. You know I have to do. Cs, I have to do. AI. I have to do. That's not the point. What you need to do is you need to demonstrate your overcoming adversity.

687
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:43.470
Ivylevel: growing as a student into a leader, impacting your community, pursuing your passions with consistency and grit and perseverance the future leaders of the world.

688
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.719
Ivylevel: the future leaders of the world, do not just think about themselves

689
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.500
Ivylevel: right? You can't be just thinking about. You know my marks, my thing.

690
01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:54.399
Ivylevel: You are a girl who's gonna impact. And I'm telling you as a proud dad today

691
01:12:54.650 --> 01:13:17.860
Ivylevel: that my daughter has influenced, like, you know, tens and thousands of girls today, and she comes from a place where she was completely in a boys heavy club. And this will happen. Trust me, just follow the process. Be consistent with the way they are, you know, helping you and do not take a lot, and if you have any doubts, hey? There are 15 clubs and competitions I was not able to make it. Do not undermine yourself.

692
01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:25.390
Ivylevel: Do not undermine and speak up all your barriers, you know the only reason again to parents right? You know, my daughter would reveal so many things

693
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:48.820
Ivylevel: to her coach, and I would go into the recordings once in a while and see what is she sharing? She would share all all her internal barriers with her. That's why relatability works. Because, you know, kids don't share things with their parents, but when you kind of work with your relatable people, feel free to share your vulnerabilities, you know that is part of your story and narrative. So you should really look for a friend. Your coach is your friend.

694
01:13:48.960 --> 01:14:05.579
Ivylevel: and that's why you know this, this magic works. I'm giving you all the things that I've learned, the hard way working with many students. And of course there are students who struggle, despite, you know, spending 12 weeks, 14 weeks, 18 weeks, and then I have a chat with their parents. I say, at the end of the day it takes 2 to Tango.

695
01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:24.810
Ivylevel: and we'll put a village behind you. I mean it. I you will see this. This will happen, we I because this for me is more than just, you know, running a service. I want to make a big impact with this. I want to change, you know, communities with this. So we will bring in more and more people like research. We'll bring whatever specialist you need. I'll bring them on board.

696
01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:27.719
Ivylevel: But you need to promise me that you are going to be consistent.

697
01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:33.030
Ivylevel: And you're not giving it up. Okay, just because you have grades. Oh, I'm not gonna do my extracurriculars. No.

698
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:38.740
Ivylevel: if you want to really make an impact to the community and the world. You have to focus on extracurriculars. Very important.

699
01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.429
Ivylevel: Okay, sorry. One more, dad, talk. Okay. You have to live with it. We are, they see parents.

700
01:14:43.784 --> 01:14:55.850
Ananyaa Srivastava: No, this was wonderful, and and in our head the clock has started. So we will put all the effort for next 2 years. She is the primary effort. Like, you know.

701
01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:17.860
Ananyaa Srivastava: Provider, but we will help her in every way possible. One thing final just thought which we didn't discuss. Maybe. I'm also looking like if if she has opportunity to go to Oxford or Cambridge, those are also options available to us. I would love her to go to some place. Very good that so I don't know how that works, but but you know

702
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:27.060
Ananyaa Srivastava: I'm I'm completely open if if she wants to go to another really really great university outside as well. So you know, just keep that in mind as well.

703
01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:51.610
Ivylevel: I mean, very interesting. We we do have a coach from Cambridge, actually, Oxford, I mean, I'm not expanding into us. Uk, because us schools are in itself like such a heavy toll. But we do have a coach. Actually, you know, from Uk. If needed. You know, there was only one instance, you know where once someone wanted to go, and we brought in someone. It's very easy for me, but you know we bring in, and it's an onboarding like I. We train every coach like, you know, 3 months before they are able to like get into the team.

704
01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:53.749
Ivylevel: There is one, at least, but

705
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.580
Ivylevel: I would say that you know there is still something very beautiful about us schools.

706
01:15:58.358 --> 01:16:00.830
Ivylevel: You know. So

707
01:16:01.135 --> 01:16:09.370
Ivylevel: I think Cambridge and Oxford would be probably slightly a cakewalk compared to like. You know the way you prefer, because you know your your profile and your story will be.

708
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:17.940
Ivylevel: I mean, I can't even tell you like I cry at times. You know, reading the essays that our students have prepared after going through that 2 years journey, and I've shown Anushka's transformation.

709
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:28.199
Ivylevel: You know, one of the girls actually, you know, who won an election. And she was like all pre like, just because she won a school election. So and and I've seen. So don't worry about it.

710
01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:37.149
Ivylevel: I just don't like when girls are like, feel that they have this barriers right? Because I'm also kind of. You know I have 2 daughters, and I'm very passionate about it. I really want girls to be

711
01:16:37.524 --> 01:16:41.610
Ivylevel: you know. And you know, serendipity, like, you know, 99%

712
01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:48.390
Ivylevel: all girl coaches. And of course we do have 5% boys. I think girl power is hugely untapped. I think we need to.

713
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:55.970
Ananyaa Srivastava: We have 2 girls as well, so we have another one coming up for your course in in a few years

714
01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:21.759
Ananyaa Srivastava: we can wait a little bit, Raj. I have something here you were you you spoke about overcoming adversity right? So like you mentioned. Some of us are from the privileged background, but mental adversity, emotional adversity that also counts for right. If somebody is pathologically shy or anxious, and they, you know.

715
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.410
Ananyaa Srivastava: that could also be a beautiful story, right.

716
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.579
Ivylevel: Absolutely. And I think that is what the whole narrative is around. In fact, if you think about it, the the game plan report that comes out.

717
01:17:31.868 --> 01:18:00.340
Ivylevel: You know. You will see in that report that we will. Already we work backwards. That's 1 of the process, right? We will have. But again, you can't be like, for example, like you know, especially with my daughter, like I never thought she would get into journalism like somehow in one year. Her game plan got like she got into some very prestigious journalism, you know, thing, and but it kind of we wove it into her advocacy. Kind of profile, right? Because there is an when you become journalist you're also an advocate, so that gives you a tool extra tool.

718
01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:05.790
Ivylevel: You don't change at your core. You're still the same narrative. But you can. So what what we're going to do is

719
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:09.679
Ivylevel: absolutely, I think the reason why I was trying to highlight is.

720
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:19.750
Ivylevel: it becomes even more important for a person who is not coming from the socioeconomic adversities to highlight your mental adversities. Very important

721
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:36.319
Ivylevel: like. Don't, don't shy away is my point, you know, and and I tell that, and you know I'll be very honest at times. It takes even 10 weeks, because coaches then come back to me, and they tell that Siraj, you know, like we need your help, you know. Can you please jump in, talk to their parents. The girl is not opening up.

722
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:38.189
Ivylevel: She's not telling anything

723
01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:44.989
Ivylevel: she's not telling her interest there is. There's kind of, and I'll be very blunt right? There is that kind of tension between

724
01:18:45.210 --> 01:19:02.149
Ivylevel: the the the family, you know, and and I can understand. I'm a dad and girl like there's always that kind of tension. You know they want her to do something. She's something else like. Then I have to spend time and educate. I want to avoid all that stuff because your parents are already like your dad. You know, mom, I spend a lot of time, but your dad was able to get the essence of it.

725
01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:11.640
Ivylevel: And and all this has taken like 2 years, and I've still, like, you know, 2 2 years I've been deep into it. Of course, one year. I I did not even educate myself. But 2 years I've been learning deep.

726
01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:19.250
Ivylevel: and despite that, you know, it's very hard to crack this, because it's a very beautiful thing. It's very qualitative. It's a lot of ambiguity and chaos and abstract.

727
01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:37.469
Ivylevel: But you get it right? Yeah, so definitely bring out your adversities. Because, remember, these trail will eventually become part of your eventual package. Your essays, you know you will spend your final year, will go all on essays. Such a beautiful thing in 6 50 words. You will be writing your life story

728
01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:48.690
Ivylevel: to an admission officer. But trust me if you haven't lived, that if you haven't done that. Nothing will come out. You can fake it the way you like it. Trust me, might be one or 2 fake like, you know. We'll get in.

729
01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:56.830
Ivylevel: It's just hard. But when you are doing this authentically and naturally, like, you know, so powerful. And and I'll I'll you know, ask your coaches. They will send you.

730
01:19:56.950 --> 01:20:03.039
Ivylevel: You know, the kind of winning applications that get into Stanford Harvard. They write about their Costco essay

731
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:10.099
Ivylevel: the L. Word the you know there. There is nothing about your, you know. Don't bring your subject matter expertise, you know you have to show you don't tell.

732
01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:12.620
Ivylevel: Show your impact. Don't tell.

733
01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:13.810
Ivylevel: Agree. I mean.

734
01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:14.800
Ivylevel: yeah.

735
01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:28.480
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yeah, it might seem little to, you know, a lot of people, but the kind of impact that it leaves on the life that it touches, you know it can build a very powerful story. Have you heard about Zarnagar? The stand up, comedian, Siraj.

736
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:31.619
Ivylevel: I mean the the Indian lady.

737
01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:39.279
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes, the Indian lady, the Indian mom. So my daughter got into Stanford and you know what made her story stand out.

738
01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:55.120
Ananyaa Srivastava: She, her mom was, had gone into depression for many years, and but she used to be a very funny person. So she reached out to all her friends her Mom's friends and relatives, and made them write letters to her mom to encourage her to become a comedian.

739
01:20:55.590 --> 01:21:04.489
Ananyaa Srivastava: So there! I I thought, it's such a wonderful story, you know, and it it made her stand out her on her Stanford application, and she got through Stanford.

740
01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:22.930
Ivylevel: Yeah. And and I'll be very honest. Right? I think this is where somehow, culturally, there's a barrier with really Indian families, you know they see, I think I think if you compare with like the East Asians, and not to sound a Nationalist or anything else group is here. But there is a hundred barrier where our our kids are very shy to, you know, like

741
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:50.319
Ivylevel: talk about their vulnerabilities and their experience, whereas when you think about the backgrounds of, you know, like, really, you know, East Asians. And you know, Southeast Asians, I think they come from a very different kind of background to this country, and what happens is like, you know, they are. They're really starting from scratch. And and I see a lot of success stories where they do not shy away, and their essays really speak for that, even like you know, talking about, you know, stresses and tensions and family, and like so. But again. Remember.

742
01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.909
Ivylevel: the only way to win this game is you, be you.

743
01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:55.670
Ivylevel: UBU. Is the only

744
01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:07.669
Ivylevel: do not try to fake like, do not create anything just because of that, because that that that is a sure way for you to not stand out. See? The only thing unique about you is your fingerprint your DNA right?

745
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:22.320
Ivylevel: Like you need to have that in everything. So that is your power, like, Oh, yeah, I'm a girl who actually is a shy girl. Amazing, you know that is a beautiful thing. Of course I don't want you to be shy. I want you to grow into a strong leader.

746
01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.839
Ivylevel: But what inspires someone.

747
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.920
Ivylevel: a person who's born strong

748
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:32.559
Ivylevel: and always been like, you know, at the forefront, or a person who comes from a racks to richer stories.

749
01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:47.230
Ivylevel: You need rack to richer stories, you know. People remember stories right? Don't cook it. Yeah, you you will enjoy it so. Absolutely. I'm glad that you know, it takes a lot of time for me to really educate parents, and I'll be very honest. I'm talking about cios and very top execs, you know.

750
01:22:47.250 --> 01:23:06.179
Ivylevel: Unfortunately, sometimes it's very hard for me, and I tell them that you know, please. You know I don't think this is working out because they again come with the checklist mindset. And they're like, Oh, yeah, we've been doing this program. She hasn't won. XYZ. It's not about, you know, we we have outcomes. We can show data that you know, we are able to get the smaller outcomes. You need. Lot of smaller trail.

751
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:07.840
Ivylevel: See, the main game is

752
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.199
Ivylevel: 75% is qualitative. That's what it is.

753
01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:24.800
Ivylevel: How do you quantify? Your qualitative work is where the challenges you need data points, competitions is just one endorsement and attestation authority that gives you some attestation and saying, Oh, yeah, you got one competition one.

754
01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.570
Ivylevel: But when it comes to the real heavy weights.

755
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:30.200
Ivylevel: community impact passion project.

756
01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:56.180
Ivylevel: That is something that you will have to come out. You're talking about. Your mom used the word self promotion. You know. It is a part like you will do that. Eventually you will come out and you will start speaking about your project, and you will scale it. You will have thousands of people joining it, you will organize events. So in the process you will become from a shy girl to a self advocate. If you do not advocate for yourself who's gonna advocate for you?

757
01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:07.700
Ivylevel: Right? So that's why I'm telling you, not honestly like I don't even know where my daughter will end today. You know she's in the last mile, but for me she's already a winner, because to me I know that I even tell her like you know, get into Stanford, or wherever like, you know, drop out

758
01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:14.059
Ivylevel: because she's a founder already. She's raised money. She's done doing amazing things. So I'm like, you're already a leader, you know

759
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:15.509
Ivylevel: that is a success for me.

760
01:24:16.170 --> 01:24:28.770
Ivylevel: So I think you will be, you know. Be confident. And then you know. And and it's okay, completely. Okay, at times, you know the and and, by the way, always be a bit like, you know. I would say kind to your parents.

761
01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.490
Ivylevel: because parents come from a very different background.

762
01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:47.849
Ivylevel: Right? We come from a very. And they all want you to succeed. So there will be that stress all the time where you know they feel like, okay. You know why she got to be in this. But remember, B is not end of the world. In fact, how do you change that? B to A, now is going to be the amazing thing that we need. We need more of those low points in your profile.

763
01:24:47.920 --> 01:25:04.300
Ivylevel: and if you have a few we'll we'll try to composite, and especially like with freshmen, you know. Grades are not that important. I mean, I'm not saying you're not to study. But when I look at you know eventually, in 2 years time, when your application goes out, there are many other things that will factor which will overshadow all of these things. Not a big deal

764
01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:09.279
Ivylevel: so but you know, see, I I like the beauty of this

765
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:12.109
Ivylevel: like. Just look at the things that Jenny is stressed upon

766
01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:23.749
Ivylevel: because she's working backwards. She's literally she conducted this as an admission officer, right? So she's working backwards, and she's saying that your biggest weak sport that is going to be very costly for you is your lack of relationship with your teachers.

767
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:25.029
Ivylevel: She was spot on.

768
01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:48.390
Ivylevel: you know, because the biggest 3 factors in the outcome. And this is from Raj Shetty, and you can probably, like I have posted a lot of things about it. The most comprehensive and high fidelity data. Today from an economist on college admissions outcome. For the last 20 years, Raj Shetty has released this data and he basically looked at all the admits in the Iv schools in the last 20 years, plus 3 out main outcome drivers, extracurriculars. Number one.

769
01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.809
Ivylevel: number 2. Your letter of recommendation.

770
01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.460
Ananyaa Srivastava: Yes.

771
01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.379
Ivylevel: Because see what is letter of recommendation.

772
01:25:55.650 --> 01:26:06.910
Ivylevel: It is the quantification of your character. It's the quantification of your qualitative work, of your discipline, your leadership skills of who you are.

773
01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:17.470
Ivylevel: Do you understand? So you have to think about, always think. No, don't think through the lens of grades and marks and competition think through the lens of how can I quantify my qualitative work?

774
01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:25.600
Ivylevel: Right? So remember the 10 plus you know how many hours did Adity put on her research thing

775
01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:29.609
Ivylevel: 18 h, but she told me she was so obsessed with it

776
01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:38.440
Ivylevel: that she fell in love with it that she could not take her like weekend, she would go into that. So you have to love with what you're doing. That's very important. If you don't, you will not be able to survive this.

777
01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:46.130
Ivylevel: And that is why it's very important for you to identify one top passion project, one top community impact service project

778
01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:53.250
Ivylevel: and then rest are just small things, you know. We'll work on your awards. We'll work on these things. All this will give you a lot of boost.

779
01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:55.529
Ivylevel: You get a national award. It you'll change

780
01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:05.369
Ivylevel: right. But again, not an award that everyone gets, you know, every month award every robotics, every like leadership, award, like 10 students have it in the school like Win, something different, unique.

781
01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:14.429
Ivylevel: And then, wow! You know, food science, you know, Anushka won. Actually, National Geographic National Level award National Smithsonian on Food science.

782
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:29.239
Ivylevel: It's a national award. And we identified that for her. And and it's important to find those kind of opportunities. So I think the fundamental thing is, don't get carried away by your subject matter. Expertise. This is not, and that is the biggest difference between the tech world

783
01:27:29.670 --> 01:27:35.320
Ivylevel: and the academia in this country. Academia is very doesn't care about skills.

784
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:36.939
Ivylevel: Technical skills.

785
01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.690
Ivylevel: Academia is about leadership

786
01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:44.679
Ivylevel: academia. And I'm talking about the top Ib plus schools. And that's why you see, upward mobility happens

787
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:55.369
Ivylevel: when you're coming from Iv schools. Your upward mobility, your dad can vouch for that. Not everyone is under pitching right. There are few people who upwardly mo move because they are in that environment, that they become leaders

788
01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:09.210
Ivylevel: so they might have an advantage of getting into some, but you know, if you are at a mid level and you're at a low level, you'll always pretty much be in the same kind of income bracket. It's not just about money, is what I'm saying. Why is Iv important? Is it gives you that mindset of future leaders of the world?

789
01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:12.109
Ivylevel: Why so many startups from Stanford.

790
01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:19.680
Ivylevel: Why, 300 billion dollar plus worth of shadows from why, 8 Presidents from Howard is because that's the kind of crew you're working with

791
01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:29.949
Ivylevel: you are. You are in a different environment. You are not working with people who are looking for a job. You're looking for people who want to put a dent in the in in the ecosystem.

792
01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:38.970
Ivylevel: Right? So that is why I think I want you to aspire like be be, you know, be aspirational about it, you know it's not a prestige thing. Only.

793
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:47.579
Ivylevel: of course, if you get to Stanford Howard, you know, people will say, but you know you need to be genuine about getting into that, because if you're not genuine about getting into it, anyways, you're going to struggle there

794
01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.849
