Can you say something? 5 00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.509 huda: Oh! Can you hear me? 6 00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.548 Jenny Duan: Oh, yes, great! I can hear you sounds good. How's your day going. 7 00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:03.310 huda: It's going great! My sister's coming back from college, so be excited about that. 8 00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:21.690 Jenny Duan: That's awesome. Yeah. Well, it's nice to see you. I feel like we should just get started. Is there? Did you wanna start with reviewing, like what aspect of your Stanford fundamental or Unc. 9 00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.719 huda: I think, like the 2 most important things right now are the personal statement and the unc supplementals. 10 00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:34.199 huda: I just I had like like. I talked to my dad about my personal statement, and he just had like one 11 00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.189 huda: kind of thing he wanted to add, so let me go to the document. 12 00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.620 huda: yeah. So first, st let me put something good. Actually. 13 00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.040 huda: like the 1st half of it. 14 00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.159 huda: Over here. 15 00:05:52.993 --> 00:06:04.200 huda: From like when I'm talking about how video games like taught me like data science. And then video games taught me like how to juggle between different identities like 16 00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:13.709 huda: like that one like my dad really liked that one, and he said that was like, really, it shows my curiosity. And he said this second half, it's like 17 00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:19.189 huda: really, really different from like the 1st half. And he felt like it was like 2 different essays. 18 00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:23.310 huda: Like. He said that this bottom one was a lot more like 19 00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.479 huda: he didn't really see the connection with like how video games like 20 00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:48.720 huda: taught me like, like different things like data science and like juggling between identities. And then I suddenly started talking about like how I develop games. I I think I tried explaining that like this is my way of showing like how I'm combating this change like with this problem. But I think he's just a bit confused like, why, like, the problem comes in. In the 1st place. 21 00:06:49.168 --> 00:06:55.069 huda: and then he had some like a few, a few like different kind of like things to say like, for example. 22 00:06:55.492 --> 00:07:14.769 huda: this bit with, like the technical jargon at hackathons and advocacy at journalism conferences. He felt like it was just kind of like a resume dump. But I I don't think so. I don't know. But yeah, like he just felt like the whole this part, and like everything below that, like they didn't connect apparently. 23 00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:29.590 Jenny Duan: Alright. I think that this part doesn't feel like an I mean doesn't feel like a resume job. It feels good because you want to just give them like those pins of the other things that you're doing. As for the connection. 24 00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.380 Jenny Duan: see, isn't 25 00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.933 Jenny Duan: I feel like here. This connection makes sense. 26 00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.920 Jenny Duan: It's maybe it. 27 00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:45.921 Jenny Duan: Maybe this could be maybe this transition, I think from here to Singapore could be a little bit smoother. 28 00:07:47.120 --> 00:08:01.129 Jenny Duan: yeah, I can see definitely the critique that, like it doesn't right here you're talking about characters represent you. But here this sentence connects to here. But this sentence doesn't necessarily connect to the previous paragraph. 29 00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.460 Jenny Duan: So 30 00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.360 Jenny Duan: maybe you could emphasize like, why, you are teaching data, science 31 00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:16.880 Jenny Duan: and this goes back to like what we talked about earlier, which is like, why are these issues so important to you. 32 00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:36.840 huda: Yeah, so like this 1st sentence here. I would focus on like the reason why I developed it or like, do you think I should change this 1st part, like Synthoria, was born out of that realization because that was like, I guess my way of just addressing like oh, like, because of this realization that 33 00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:51.749 huda: I couldn't find characters who resembled me. But I guess I kind of see how like then I just talk about instead of talking about the representation aspect that I bring with some story I talk about like the data science and AI ethics. So I can see like how that 34 00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:59.000 huda: like might not make sense. So instead of saying like this, should I just like replace it by something about like 35 00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.200 huda: how? Why, I created diverse 36 00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.079 huda: characters? Maybe. 37 00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.130 Jenny Duan: And what if we just put this here 38 00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:16.160 Jenny Duan: an Rpg that teaches data science, and maybe here we have an opportunity to be more specific. So 39 00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.890 Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna make a note here. But what's going out of that realization 40 00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.540 Jenny Duan: and then period change this to a period 41 00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:38.100 Jenny Duan: as I created my characters. But as I created my characters I hesitated. How's that? I feel like? Then it takes the focus away from like the data science part, and like it still mentions it, but it doesn't make the focus instead. 42 00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.020 huda: Yeah, yeah, I think that sounds better. Actually. 43 00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.847 Jenny Duan: And then maybe we should. I think here we could be a little bit more specific, like 44 00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.300 Jenny Duan: an Rpg that teaches data, science and ethics like, why 45 00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.590 Jenny Duan: 2 young children, or like, maybe you can add a couple more words here to be a bit more descriptive about like 46 00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.410 Jenny Duan: why Sidora is important, or why you chose to create Sudoria. 47 00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.715 huda: Yeah. 48 00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.200 huda: maybe like 49 00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:11.409 huda: to bring young girls to the forefront of technological, like innovation like 50 00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.869 huda: that might be like a little too 51 00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.570 huda: like wordy. But. 52 00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.230 Jenny Duan: We, the Rpg, I developed to introduce 53 00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.860 Jenny Duan: young students to 54 00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.600 Jenny Duan: fundamental 55 00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.309 Jenny Duan: data science and AI ethics concepts 56 00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.400 Jenny Duan: missing from traditional curriculum. 57 00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.280 Jenny Duan: All of this. 58 00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.580 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Is it curriculum like? Is that. 59 00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.630 huda: It's curriculum. 60 00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.209 Jenny Duan: Yeah, curricula is the plural form. 61 00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:12.430 huda: And so over here, where it says, like, born out of that realization. Do you think I should like reiterate, like what that realization is or no? 62 00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.969 Jenny Duan: You're fine because it now it's like the most. 63 00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:30.410 Jenny Duan: But I do know I don't. I don't know if this M. Dash part is supposed to be too long. So maybe I'm thinking it might be a little long. So try to shorten it. A couple of words that would be great. 64 00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.940 Jenny Duan: Oh. 65 00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:14.700 Jenny Duan: okay, okay, I think this is fine. Actually, yeah, what do you think. 66 00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.280 huda: Yeah, I don't think there's any other way to like word it. 67 00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. 68 00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.800 Jenny Duan: okay. 69 00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.400 Jenny Duan: I don't know about this. 70 00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.327 Jenny Duan: Let me think. 71 00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:39.145 huda: Connected to 72 00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.020 huda: like the rest. So. 73 00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:56.924 huda: and also I feel like the prompt might not fit, because, like the last bit asked like, what or who do you turn to when you want to learn more? And 74 00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.870 huda: that I don't know if I address that in the essay. 75 00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:25.649 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can like I feel like, who do you turn to? One obvious answer in my mind is like your sister right, and I feel like centering is like pretty cool parallels with you and your sister. Maybe you can bring that in somehow. I don't know if it seems like a bit overdone or villainizing to talk about like Ashley and Evo, or like I don't know if that's like 76 00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.589 Jenny Duan: I don't like. I don't know how that reads like until that. 77 00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.440 huda: Hmm. 78 00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.030 huda: maybe like. 79 00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:59.640 Jenny Duan: Not villainizing is not the right word, but if the theme is like too simple or too not complex, like, for example, like, you know, like the school lunch anecdote that a lot of people are like. Oh, my school lunch smells bad because I'm reading like that's an example of a trope that, while true, is like. 80 00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.550 Jenny Duan: do you know what? I'm referencing or sorry? 81 00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:21.375 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. Well, one common story in like Asian American narratives is just like, okay, like, maybe I brought like kimchi to school or something, and it like smells bad, or like someone writes like, Oh, maybe I brought curry to school, and like, I wish I brought like a or something that's like a very common trope 82 00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:34.470 Jenny Duan: And while it's like a very powerful story, it's just been told so many times that like to some people, it feels overdone. So I don't want your your story, which I don't think it feels this way, but I don't want it to seem like trope like if that makes sense. 83 00:14:36.387 --> 00:14:43.340 huda: Also. Yeah. Also, I do agree that like, maybe I don't need to like straight out. Say Ashley and ava 84 00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:45.470 huda: because that might like 85 00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.680 huda: like. 86 00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, what if your reviewers name is a power, Ashley? Not that that is like a bad thing, but like, you know, something like that. 87 00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.884 huda: It sounds hostile. Then 88 00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.909 huda: maybe just like 89 00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.319 huda: or play it safe. 90 00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:19.229 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I don't think the concern was necessarily about playing it safe. I believe it's more like the other thing that maybe is an issue with that discussion of Ashley and Eva is that it takes the conversation like away from 91 00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:26.069 Jenny Duan: your experience, and just like makes it too much about your game without the like. Focus on 92 00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:37.059 Jenny Duan: like too much of the game without focus on your work. I mean, obviously the games of product. But like you don't want to be like about intricacies of the game, and it's more so about like what you did. 93 00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.540 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 94 00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:51.489 Jenny Duan: is there another? Is there another analogy you can use here instead of this. So I still feel like 95 00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:57.910 Jenny Duan: like this, play it safe rather than stand out like that is good. This is all good. 96 00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.660 Jenny Duan: maybe just change these 2 sentences and 97 00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.110 Jenny Duan: these 98 00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.309 Jenny Duan: to send these 2 sentences. What do you think. 99 00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:10.080 huda: So what would I change it to like like? 100 00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:19.239 huda: I mean, like, the main problem was like like deciding. If I should like make them diverse characters or underrepresented characters. 101 00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:30.450 huda: And like, I feel like this like I could do something different than like the names. But I feel like the main point of it was to show that I had to choose between, like, 102 00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.750 huda: like, like 103 00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:45.890 huda: putting people in a role that like they're not usually used to and like that was mainly for the diversity inclusion part. But yeah, like, I wouldn't know to like, replace this with. 104 00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.180 Jenny Duan: it's funny. 105 00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.990 Jenny Duan: I hesitated today. 106 00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.480 Jenny Duan: should I? 107 00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:34.089 Jenny Duan: Respond from that realization? Maybe instead of writing about your hesitation, you can just say, like as I created my characters, I intentionally made the choice to like. I like I thought about like my sister, or like I don't know how you can address this in a more eloquent way, but, like you can talk instead of like talking about the struggle, you can just say, like you made this decision intentionally to use diverse characters in your fame, because it represented like a fundamental aspect of who you are or something that inspires you. 108 00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.090 Jenny Duan: And then from that you could talk about like 109 00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:44.249 Jenny Duan: the impact that this had, for example, in like that one classroom, or that that one teacher that responded to you, or something like that. 110 00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.819 Jenny Duan: and like. 111 00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.389 Jenny Duan: why, that's unfortunate. 112 00:17:47.660 --> 00:18:00.186 huda: This, but, like my no, my only concern is that like earlier, you mentioned that like, I'm supposed to show kind of like my growth and like how I came to like like a larger realization. And then 113 00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:14.450 huda: I guess I don't know if, like the part where like, I'm realizing like, Oh, I'm not like really I guess, like representative video games. I should make a video game like with my characters and just knowing immediately, like, I don't know if that shows enough growth. 114 00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.580 huda: or like like ability to overcome a struggle. 115 00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense. 116 00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.420 Jenny Duan: I'm doing. 117 00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:39.469 Jenny Duan: i i i also like it just as it is right now. I feel like it's true to you and like. 118 00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.670 Jenny Duan: I don't know if it's like worth going through all this to like 119 00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:53.560 Jenny Duan: potentially try to make someone else feel more comfortable when you don't think that your essay makes them. I don't think your essay is 120 00:18:54.876 --> 00:19:02.530 Jenny Duan: in terms of like, I know he's the admissions officer by like you know more play, but I think it's like good as is honestly 121 00:19:03.264 --> 00:19:04.780 Jenny Duan: with that analogy. 122 00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.399 huda: Yeah, I I personally liked it. I I just think. 123 00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.570 huda: maybe like. 124 00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:22.109 huda: like, Oh, yeah. Also, my dad did not like this sentence over here, video games. Quickly. 125 00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.680 Jenny Duan: One. 126 00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.080 huda: Whisper 127 00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:35.750 huda: because of kind of like curiosity, like just saying that you're curious. A curious like kind of just kind of says that you're not curious. 128 00:19:44.001 --> 00:20:00.660 Jenny Duan: What's another way you could. 129 00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.689 huda: I mean, this one might be too vague, but, like 130 00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:11.509 huda: video games quickly became like the foundation of for my identity. But, like. 131 00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.869 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's not really the foundation. 132 00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:25.460 Jenny Duan: yeah. 133 00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.290 huda: I don't know. I don't know how else to word it. But 134 00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.200 huda: yeah. 135 00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.339 Jenny Duan: Like, okay, let's look at this essay. This is one of my favorite essays that's like 136 00:20:33.842 --> 00:20:38.049 Jenny Duan: pretty similar to yours, like it's like him building some things. 137 00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.029 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 138 00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.010 huda: I think we read this essay before. 139 00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.660 Jenny Duan: Yeah, we have. 140 00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.900 Jenny Duan: But like. 141 00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.219 huda: Yeah, I'll reach again. 142 00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.789 Jenny Duan: It's like, it's like him doing something. 143 00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah, here's like the solution discussion. 144 00:21:31.935 --> 00:21:32.630 Jenny Duan: And 145 00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:40.461 Jenny Duan: now I'm gonna pause the screen. But go back to your essay. 146 00:21:59.455 --> 00:22:09.309 Jenny Duan: I think here. 147 00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:15.580 Jenny Duan: you should make this more like, I developed synthoria. 148 00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.640 Jenny Duan: Make it more human. First.st 149 00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.460 Jenny Duan: Sure. 150 00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.680 Jenny Duan: Okay. 151 00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.345 Jenny Duan: thanks. 152 00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:41.810 Jenny Duan: Okay. 153 00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.180 huda: Hmm. 154 00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:04.109 huda: yeah, I'm not. I'm trying to like, I'm trying to find like where I can improve it, because 155 00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.159 huda: I don't know. I 156 00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:12.980 huda: don't like, I feel like the only problem was like the connection, maybe. But like I I think 157 00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.120 huda: I think it's not too bad. 158 00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.250 Jenny Duan: I think we fix that problem just by moving this on. 159 00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.999 huda: Okay. Then I. 160 00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.949 Jenny Duan: Good. I just. I changed the sentence like, video games really became the launching point for my questions. I don't know if this launching point is the right word. But 161 00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.183 Jenny Duan: maybe, like. 162 00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.300 huda: Maybe, like 163 00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:05.299 huda: video like, answer these questions almost cause like when I'm not bound to one narrative, one language, one rule. I'm like a gamer, I guess, and like 164 00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:17.770 huda: I have all these different roles through video games. So in a way, it answered like, Oh, how do I do my math homework. How do I like? Who am I when I'm not bounded by all these like one of these and identities? 165 00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.070 huda: I think it kind of became like an answer to those questions. 166 00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.033 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 167 00:24:33.356 --> 00:24:35.679 Jenny Duan: We. 168 00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.654 huda: Maybe for this, to make more sense, I can like add a question 169 00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:47.589 huda: near like the math problem part, so that like they'll understand like, oh, these questions are being answered by video games, and they'll see that pattern. Maybe. 170 00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Why don't you add that ready? 171 00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:50.870 huda: Yeah. 172 00:25:05.071 --> 00:25:06.940 huda: should I replace this with like. 173 00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.680 huda: or just like, delete this and then write the question. 174 00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.919 huda: I'm faced with a tricky, graphing problem. 175 00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:22.499 Jenny Duan: I don't know if we need to replace. We'll try adding the question first, st and then we'll see if we have extra words. Too many words. 176 00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.829 huda: I don't know if this is the right question. 177 00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:49.069 Jenny Duan: I feel like, maybe not, adding, maybe you don't need to add a question here, because it's still so far from 178 00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.670 Jenny Duan: down here. 179 00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.200 huda: Like. I don't know if. 180 00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.380 Jenny Duan: Like the reader will understand the connection. 181 00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.630 huda: And should I keep? I feel like this should be like separate paragraph. 182 00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.510 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree. 183 00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:51.719 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like I, I looked for solutions in the games I played, or something, but like 184 00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.180 Jenny Duan: something about like 185 00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.730 Jenny Duan: I I still don't know if this is, this percentage is the best transition. 186 00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:07.069 huda: yeah, like, maybe, like, the wording is also like, so maybe like video, games. 187 00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.389 huda: for me, video games. 188 00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.640 huda: Answered these these questions. 189 00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:38.280 huda: And I but then I feel like it also loses the connection of this part like, I didn't constitute video games, because then that doesn't like really relate to like video games, video games. Answering my questions. 190 00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.290 Jenny Duan: What's an example of a missing character being little colonized in a video game. 191 00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:55.260 huda: Sorry. What did you say? 192 00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.690 Jenny Duan: What's an example of a Muslim character being villainized in a video game. 193 00:28:01.761 --> 00:28:13.109 huda: Like, for example, in call of duty. I think I already mentioned it, but like there's plenty of characters with like Muslim names which are often like radicalized 194 00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.739 huda: and then I'm trying to think of some examples. But 195 00:28:20.455 --> 00:28:21.130 huda: yeah. 196 00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.520 Jenny Duan: Okay. 197 00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.080 Jenny Duan: are you. 198 00:28:31.936 --> 00:28:33.030 huda: Let's called. 199 00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.700 Jenny Duan: No. 200 00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.210 Jenny Duan: let's see 201 00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.820 Jenny Duan: 6. 202 00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:27.660 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if this would be like a clear connection here, because I don't know. Maybe if you don't reference, a specific character. It might just feel like an over generalization. 203 00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:33.209 huda: I had like so like another thing I could have said is like 5% being Asian. 204 00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.939 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe that would be better. 205 00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:40.169 Jenny Duan: Maybe instead of this sentence, you can just say. 206 00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.899 huda: It's not better if I said, do they reflect who I am? 207 00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:48.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, yeah. 208 00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:31.539 Jenny Duan: wait. I'm not sure if this is exactly this, these 2 sentences are smooth now, because it feels like it's saying, like you developed it from this realization. But then, like you go back and you say, like, here's the problem again, like you're like solution. And then the problem like, I don't know if that makes sense, but it doesn't feel as smooth saying like, you developed it from this realization, and after reading this I maybe would expect to hear more about like 209 00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:37.049 Jenny Duan: what that entailed. But then you go back to like describing the problem. After that. 210 00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:57.030 huda: Yeah, I can see that. But like, I wanted to show that like, even though I realized that, like my community was like underrepresented in games. I still hesitated because of like these different like things like, for example, if people would relate, or if, like their names, would even be pronounceable for other people. 211 00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:00.439 huda: But then, like I realized, and then I said, like 212 00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:05.820 huda: no, just to bring representation. 213 00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:11.192 Jenny Duan: Right. That makes sense. Okay. 214 00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.659 Jenny Duan: no, we don't know. 215 00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:41.260 Jenny Duan: I don't know if if this sentence could be so cut and dry and saying, like you like video games like became the answer to your questions, because I feel like, in a sense, your essay is saying that, like you still haven't exactly found the answer 216 00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.500 Jenny Duan: right 217 00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:47.300 Jenny Duan: or like you're still to some extent searching. 218 00:32:49.848 --> 00:32:51.641 huda: Kind of. I feel like. 219 00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.200 Jenny Duan: Or do you feel like you found the answers. 220 00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.719 huda: Yeah, I feel like video games have helped me find the answers. I think I don't know. 221 00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:11.030 huda: I feel like it might not be the answer. But it's like, I'm not bound by like one like rule. And 222 00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.190 huda: yeah, I think it's like, been my guide to answer these questions. Now, maybe. 223 00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:20.750 Jenny Duan: When they begin. 224 00:33:21.637 --> 00:33:25.460 Jenny Duan: maybe answer to this problem here. 225 00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.029 Jenny Duan: maybe, like guide or 226 00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.999 Jenny Duan: say, like, Hi. 227 00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.505 Jenny Duan: I 228 00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:35.370 Jenny Duan: that's good. 229 00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.090 Jenny Duan: like. 230 00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:51.729 Jenny Duan: I read something about how you found your search in video games, or you found your answers to video games. You could also make that person first.st But I'm not sure. 231 00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.061 huda: Like video games quickly revealed. 232 00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:56.730 huda: like 233 00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.490 huda: hmm 234 00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.360 huda: revealed 235 00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.290 huda: or helped me discover who I am. 236 00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.179 huda: but. 237 00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:14.500 Jenny Duan: Have a great day. 238 00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:14.940 huda: They didn't. 239 00:34:15.049 --> 00:34:16.609 Jenny Duan: Like, or. 240 00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.719 huda: I don't know the wording, but 241 00:34:20.724 --> 00:34:22.540 huda: the game is quickly. 242 00:34:22.796 --> 00:34:23.310 Jenny Duan: Think that 243 00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:50.270 Jenny Duan: I feel like saying this like you don't really. You never truly know who you are, so I feel like it's still too, general. Maybe, like 244 00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:55.210 Jenny Duan: I, I begun my ongoing search. 245 00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:56.989 Jenny Duan: 3 videos available. 246 00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:03.559 Jenny Duan: We're going to answer these questions 247 00:35:04.935 --> 00:35:07.080 Jenny Duan: something like that. 248 00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.146 Jenny Duan: My ongoing 249 00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:29.689 Jenny Duan: right? Something from that tone. Maybe not that exact sentence, just like something with that. 250 00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.200 huda: Begun my ongoing search. 251 00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:56.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like this shows like a clear problem statement, too, because as you're going through the search like, you're not able to find 252 00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.450 Jenny Duan: sorry. 253 00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:43.139 huda: Wait. Is there? Is there like a bad side to using, like the common app prompt, which just says, like, share an essay on on any topic of your choice. It could be anyone that you've written, one that responds to a different, prompt, or one of your own designs. 254 00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.609 Jenny Duan: I don't think there's anything that. 255 00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:54.610 huda: Then I think that might be better, because, this one, I'd have to like tweak it a lot so that 256 00:36:55.025 --> 00:37:00.049 huda: I could fit in the aspect with my sister. And also I don't think I don't think 257 00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:13.380 huda: like I know, there's like a parallelism with like video games. But then I feel like I wouldn't ask my sister for help to like show, like, how to like, learn more about how video games can impact you cause like 258 00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:18.939 huda: like. She doesn't really play video games either, and I don't think I have any figures that I've like. 259 00:37:19.374 --> 00:37:22.769 huda: I should like learn more about this like 260 00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.600 huda: curiosity. I think so. I don't know if it'll fit that prompt. 261 00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:34.779 Jenny Duan: That makes a lot of sense. In that case, I feel like you can just use that general pump. I don't think there's anything like that. 262 00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:36.690 huda: Okay. Then. 263 00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.989 Jenny Duan: Sorry. I'm like walking around trying to find 264 00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.570 Jenny Duan: yeah. So give me a good. 265 00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:47.590 huda: Oh, wow! 266 00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:54.469 huda: It's like peak product. Productivity hour at Stanford. 267 00:37:54.810 --> 00:38:01.319 Jenny Duan: And now also, there's just no outlets. 268 00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:12.334 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think I found. Give me a second 269 00:38:46.033 --> 00:38:55.039 Jenny Duan: back to 270 00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.730 Jenny Duan: okay. I feel like, now. 271 00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:06.170 Jenny Duan: what was your dad's other like objection to this essay, or like, what else do you think could be improved? 272 00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:12.019 huda: Okay, so like just the main part that he felt like 273 00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:17.650 huda: he was, this 1st part really enjoyed, like the nuance in it. And it he felt. 274 00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.260 Jenny Duan: It's the 1st bit. 275 00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.390 huda: Right here. Felt like kind of 276 00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:52.879 huda: innocent. He described it because, like, because, like looking at the world and like, I'm seeing like this many pixels, and like that helped me, and then, like the example with, like the Minecraft, and like the math homework like, I think he really enjoyed like how I was kind of showing like these different aspects like this kind of already shows that I'm a problem solver. And then it shows about like my different identities and like ability to like balance and then I feel like already kind of fixed it. But he just like 277 00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.730 huda: you, wanna can you imagine like this part was like when I was younger. 278 00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.490 huda: and then he imagined, like this part. 279 00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:01.080 Jenny Duan: It's very cool. 280 00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.280 huda: Now I'm doing like all these workshops and things. But 281 00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:08.479 huda: like, yeah, maybe I can like mention my age here now. 282 00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.230 huda: maybe like I feel like at at 16. 283 00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:27.040 huda: Yeah. And then I think that'll that would fix the problem. Because I think he was just like he didn't see that like I go from there, and he just he just kind of got shocked that like 284 00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.379 huda: it went from like 285 00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:32.550 huda: homework. And like these different things like me developing whole game. 286 00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.299 huda: But yeah, I think 287 00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.510 huda: like mentioning the game plan. 288 00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.340 huda: But. 289 00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:50.449 Jenny Duan: I feel like, since we fix these 2 these couple sentences it, I think the transition does. 290 00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:51.859 huda: I think he he really liked it. 291 00:40:53.440 --> 00:41:00.428 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. So now we just have a couple of ports. Just fine. Let's just fix that. 292 00:41:01.243 --> 00:41:02.030 Jenny Duan: I think. 293 00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.619 huda: It's 2 words over. 294 00:41:04.547 --> 00:41:07.329 Jenny Duan: Thank for me. 295 00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:08.210 huda: Oh! Forward! 296 00:41:14.645 --> 00:41:31.220 Jenny Duan: Okay, you're you're good now. 297 00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:31.870 huda: Okay. 298 00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:33.840 huda: Oh. 299 00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:47.859 Jenny Duan: Great. Okay? Yeah. So okay, I think you should show this, maybe to him again, and see if he has any additional feedback. But other than that. I think it's quite good, like I think it was good before. I think it's better. 300 00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:59.450 Jenny Duan: I think. Maybe like as more as we do more like. We come back to this in like a day or 2 we might add something else, but like at the like, at the end of the day. It's like 301 00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.709 Jenny Duan: you're always gonna find something to change about your essay. But like 302 00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:13.540 Jenny Duan: you just like, sometimes you just move on, because again, like admissions officers, they're spending like, maybe 5 min. Max, on this essay so they're, not gonna notice list details to the extent, that you do 303 00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:16.160 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay. 304 00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:21.839 Jenny Duan: so now, I think let's go back to your unc supplementals. How's that? 305 00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:32.320 huda: That sounds great and I think I don't know if we'll have time. We probably won't. But I also wanted to make sure, like my activities and everything are good as well, because 306 00:42:32.704 --> 00:42:36.250 huda: but Unc. Application is actually due in 4 days. So. 307 00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:42.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm aware I'm aware it did. If you just have, have they responded yet to your email. 308 00:42:43.095 --> 00:42:49.619 huda: My English teacher started writing hers. I think, like my computer science teacher hasn't. 309 00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.660 huda: But 310 00:42:52.054 --> 00:42:55.930 huda: I also, I can tell her on Monday as well, which I know it might be like a little 311 00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:02.559 huda: soon. But I'll just like remind her. And then also we have like a 2 week kind of grace period for them to turn it in. 312 00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.299 Jenny Duan: Okay? So yeah, that's fine. 313 00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:14.600 Jenny Duan: okay? Oh, I like this, this is new. Okay? 314 00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:15.420 huda: Yeah. 315 00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.290 Jenny Duan: And then 316 00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.619 Jenny Duan: give me a minute. I'm just gonna read this like really carefully 317 00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:17.079 Jenny Duan: and I love essay 2, I think essay 2 is great. And 318 00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.310 Jenny Duan: I wanna start here. Actually. 319 00:44:20.987 --> 00:44:26.172 Jenny Duan: I think this is like. 320 00:44:27.582 --> 00:44:37.179 Jenny Duan: I think this can be. And this is like done. I feel like I wanna read up. Can you read it out? Can you read it out loud? 321 00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:42.199 Jenny Duan: And then after that it could be loud. Yeah, you can read it out loud. Yeah. 322 00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:49.309 huda: I collect data the way people collect souvenirs. Every data set, every obscure archive is a story waiting to be told. 323 00:44:49.400 --> 00:45:08.730 huda: The browser tabs are a Testament or my browser tabs are a Testament, one, a spotify data visualization on Billy Joel's top tracks, while the other tracks points scored during the latest fortnight cash Cup somewhere in there. I'm also investigating the statistical journey of the rice in my mother's palau, wondering how far these grains travel to land on my plate 324 00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:14.849 huda: at 13. I saw my cheek for DNA analysis. Because why not contribute to global databases? 325 00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:20.230 huda: I wasn't just looking for ancestors. I wanted to know how migration shaped human history. 326 00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.109 huda: My brain is constantly humming. How can AI bias be measured through personal stories? 327 00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:32.460 huda: It's the obsession with it's this obsession with the untold stories and data that draws me to Unc. School of data, science and society. 328 00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.750 huda: I'm eager to take courses like governance bias and ethics. And AI 329 00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.940 huda: understand? To understand how algorithms influence societal outcomes 330 00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:54.260 huda: the interdisciplinary approach from public health to computer science allows aligns with how I think about data, interconnected narratives waiting to be discovered 331 00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:16.770 huda: at Unc's research, educational entertainment lab. I hope to transform data into visual stories that don't just inform, but inspire, whether mapping disparities in education, access or predicting the next big Podcast I'm excited to uncover the invisible threads that bind us all because in a world of overflowing with information, learning to listen might just be the most powerful skill of all. 332 00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:22.439 Jenny Duan: This is great. Does Unc's data science school emphasize interdisciplinary learning. 333 00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:29.020 huda: Yeah, I think that's like a research like the most important part of like their data science program. I think. 334 00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:40.930 Jenny Duan: Great. This is great. Approved. Let's go back to this essay. This is really good, too, but 335 00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:46.438 Jenny Duan: I think this 1st sentence could still be improved a little bit. 336 00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.740 Jenny Duan: I feel like. 337 00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.870 Jenny Duan: why can you tell me why textbooks are overrated. 338 00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:59.290 huda: Because 339 00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:17.089 huda: people always think that, like the way to study for a test is to like, read a textbook and then like, try to gain all the knowledge like overnight. But the real way that, like I and like many people that I know learn is through whiteboards when they'd cram for tests. They'd like, write down everything that they know. 340 00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:30.449 huda: They like, make connection between all the different things that they learned. And then they actually apply it. And it's a lot more helpful like when you're actually needing this information. And for example, like 341 00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:42.029 huda: textbooks really just like, give information. But like whiteboard is where it can tests you if like. You know this, and it like it actually like puts what you know onto like the 342 00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.120 huda: like slate. I guess. 343 00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:53.689 Jenny Duan: Alright. Okay. I just added this. Rather. I feel like that may be 344 00:47:54.270 --> 00:48:04.938 Jenny Duan: makes the connection a little bit smoother. I like this where instruction becomes smaller. So that's good. And then I'm gonna change this into like a more 345 00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:09.920 Jenny Duan: I think like putting into present tense is good, even if it's a singular knowledge. 346 00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:17.079 Jenny Duan: Every Sunday morning at maybe my local boss 347 00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:29.379 Jenny Duan: notice the 21 pairs I noticed 2021 pairs of eyes not treated on the ceiling, the walls anywhere but the lesson. 348 00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:34.160 Jenny Duan: I stand in front of my classroom calling each student. I ask. 349 00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.374 Jenny Duan: oh, I see. Okay. 350 00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:49.839 Jenny Duan: see? So this is like one singular example among like many instances. 351 00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:57.080 Jenny Duan: So how do we? I? The thing that I want to emphasize is this isn't just like a 1 day. Volunteer thing. This is like something that you're continuously involved in. 352 00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:58.270 huda: Yeah. 353 00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.849 huda: maybe like 354 00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:25.100 huda: as like, maybe like, I always notice that these kids are always squirming and not paying attention. But this time I try to like, I decided, I want to take action and like try something different. And then that's like what? Why, this instance specifically different. But then that way, we can also like weave in that. I do this every Sunday morning. I see these kids like every 355 00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.919 huda: week. Maybe. 356 00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe. 357 00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:41.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me just add in some filler right now, this isn't gonna be good. We're gonna change it. But I'm just gonna like, put some stuff down 358 00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:47.559 Jenny Duan: most weeks. As I read that lesson plan I noticed 21 pairs of eyes once traded 359 00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.420 Jenny Duan: anything 360 00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:52.879 Jenny Duan: put the lesson 361 00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.129 Jenny Duan: one week. Hi. 362 00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:02.799 Jenny Duan: I don't know. I decided to make a change. We're gonna change that I stayed. I stood in front of the classroom. 363 00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:05.859 Jenny Duan: Probably. Shouldn't I ask, what 364 00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.690 Jenny Duan: what does kindness look like? 365 00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.040 Jenny Duan: The chaos 366 00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.490 Jenny Duan: becomes 367 00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:13.170 Jenny Duan: chatter and laughter. 368 00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.060 huda: And then I. 369 00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:25.570 Jenny Duan: Culture, the focus on your lesson. Not necessarily just like it's not just the whiteboard. It's like you encouraging them in these new learning strategies. 370 00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.590 huda: Maybe something like 371 00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:01.664 huda: I don't know. This would be too repetitive. But I want to say, like my instruction. 372 00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:04.849 huda: turned to knowledge 373 00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.250 huda: as 374 00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.680 huda: there 375 00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:16.080 huda: ideas came to life. 376 00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.549 huda: this might be too broad, or like vague. 377 00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:39.870 huda: sure. 378 00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:18.679 Jenny Duan: Does Unc really value like learning by doing something that they emphasize. Because one thing, I don't want to villainize like textbook style learning, because, like, maybe, like a lot of their, a lot of their classes are, if their philosophy is on textbook style. Learning like you don't just don't want to like you want to be careful there. But did you. 379 00:53:24.759 --> 00:53:28.059 huda: I don't know about how to go about this sentence. 380 00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:29.360 huda: Hmm. 381 00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.140 huda: and also, yeah, this sentence might be like villainizing textbooks. 382 00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.320 huda: but. 383 00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:44.649 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because I get how this is like a fun analogy. But we just don't want to like villainize. Let's see, what sentence are you having struggle with right now. 384 00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.410 huda: Here. 385 00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 386 00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.480 Jenny Duan: the chaos between. 387 00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.269 Jenny Duan: maybe, like 388 00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.426 Jenny Duan: evolving into. 389 00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:11.810 Jenny Duan: yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. 390 00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:13.680 huda: Oh, yeah. 391 00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:23.629 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. Let's go back to this textbook insight. I'm not. Yeah, I don't. I don't know about this. 392 00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:24.530 huda: Yeah. 393 00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:27.359 Jenny Duan: Like they learned by twig. He cut out this. 394 00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:43.949 huda: And then should I? I think, the sentence the sentence afterwards should connect it to Whiteboards. 395 00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:46.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 396 00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.493 Jenny Duan: thank you. 397 00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.430 Jenny Duan: Okay. 398 00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:14.949 Jenny Duan: okay, yeah. I'd love to see this textbook analogy more throughout, but without making the textbooks villainizing. 399 00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.719 huda: I don't know how to. I don't have a 400 00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.990 huda: connect it back to the 401 00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.140 huda: let me see. 402 00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.010 huda: let's see. 403 00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.580 huda: Maybe like 404 00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:57.510 huda: I can write about like how 405 00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.270 huda: by making choices. They 406 00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.040 huda: like 407 00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.440 huda: draw connections like that on the whiteboard. 408 00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:11.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe I don't know. I 409 00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.960 Jenny Duan: I don't know if it would be better if you move this above the centuria 410 00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.790 Jenny Duan: ntoria. One. 411 00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.990 huda: Yeah, maybe 412 00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:41.039 huda: cause I also feel like the best way to explain, like the benefit of like Whiteboards is that it's like it's internalized. But I don't wanna like repeat that like over and over. 413 00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:55.589 huda: or would that or could that be like even like repetition? Maybe like like, for example. 414 00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:56.770 huda: where 415 00:57:57.921 --> 00:58:07.610 huda: entrepreneurship is internalized, not taught. And then, like the last one could be like for data. Science is intern or like 416 00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:14.990 huda: data, sciences internalized, not taught like. Maybe it could be like a matter of like repetition, or like parallelism. 417 00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:19.800 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what would you use? What would you repeat like a phrase, or a sentence, or a question. 418 00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:26.199 huda: Yeah, this specific part, like evolving into space where kindness is internalized, not taught. 419 00:58:26.634 --> 00:58:28.999 huda: It could be just something like 420 00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.790 huda: like something like that. I don't know if it looks out of place. 421 00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:02.229 Jenny Duan: I feel like the repetitiveness doesn't flow. Well. 422 01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.810 Jenny Duan: how's that? 423 01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:23.230 Jenny Duan: Okay? 424 01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.759 huda: Yeah, I like the clothing sentence. It sounds really great. 425 01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.650 Jenny Duan: Okay. 426 01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:52.019 Jenny Duan: I feel like, just I feel like it just by moving this like the the flip part. I feel like it feels a lot more smoother here because it's like here, like you talked about sharing stories and inspiring others. Then, like you continue that, and then the learn by doing is like a good connection to the beginning. 427 01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.369 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's sweet now. 428 01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.465 Jenny Duan: I don't know what are your thoughts. 429 01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.169 huda: Yeah, I agree. But do you think that like 430 01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:10.750 huda: cause I don't know. I don't really think that the whiteboard is like an analogy for like the whole thing but but like, I don't know if it's like being reflected in every paragraph enough. But like 431 01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:12.100 huda: what do you think. 432 01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.510 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine, because. 433 01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:22.440 Jenny Duan: like the theme is not just the whiteboard, it's it's like about how learning like doing is more valuable than. And then like 434 01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:29.870 Jenny Duan: saying, Well, it's like learning by doing right. And you mentioned that here you mentioned like inspiring others. Here I feel like it's 435 01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:35.289 Jenny Duan: it flows. Well, I mean, it's like you only have 2 50 words. So they're not gonna forget the analogy by the end. 436 01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.500 huda: Yeah. 437 01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:43.220 Jenny Duan: Wait this out loud, and then from there we can see if there's anything that maybe sticks when you say it out loud. 438 01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.610 huda: Textbooks are overrated. Rather whiteboards are the grounds where instruction becomes knowledge. 439 01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.780 huda: Every Sunday morning I face a room of squirming kids at my local mosque 440 01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:00.690 huda: most weeks. As I read out the lesson plan, I notice 21 pairs of eyes concentrated on the ceiling walls, the floor 441 01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:02.429 huda: anywhere but the lesson. 442 01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:18.280 huda: One week I decided to make a change with an expo marker and a dream. I stand in front of the classroom calling each student. I ask, what! What does kindness look like from mother cooking food for her family? To a gardener at the park, drawing slowly enveloped the whiteboard. 443 01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.900 huda: the chaos becomes chatter and laughter, evolving into a space where kindness is internalized, not taught. 444 01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:33.240 huda: After service. I penned stories of Muslim entrepreneurs in my rural town like a software engineer selling Biryani from his garage 445 01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:40.700 huda: writing for youth newspapers. I help these small business business owners share their stories and inspire others. 446 01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:46.899 huda: I continue this philosophy in synthoria. A video game I created to teach girls about AI and ethics 447 01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:48.709 huda: rather than handling them. 448 01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:51.110 huda: Then handling 449 01:02:54.410 --> 01:03:04.820 huda: them answers. I designed a world where players navigate moral dilemmas. Should a robot lie to protect feelings, should I prioritize efficiency over empathy. 450 01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:21.519 huda: through their choices, they learn by doing whether it's a classroom, a newspaper, or a game. I believe in in creating space for others to think, explore, and draw their own connections. Textbooks may provide information, but whiteboards and the experiences that fill them, allow us to truly think. 451 01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:29.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, couple of questions here. So 1st of all, what personal quality are you emphasizing here. 452 01:03:30.584 --> 01:03:46.189 huda: I'm emphasizing like adaptability, and like in situations where like, for example, I think, like the Sunday school, one matches the best. But like I'll just like adapt to make sure that people can learn like, no matter in what media 453 01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.090 huda: and like. Also, I guess, like my ability to like teach people. I think that as well. 454 01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.509 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if that comes through. 455 01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:06.189 Jenny Duan: I think we should put. 456 01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.749 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like I feel like somewhere we should emphasize more of the youth. 457 01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:21.440 Jenny Duan: because it seems like these textbooks and whiteboards. It's an effective device. But we need to connect it back to you like, maybe you're just missing like a couple of words change or like what sentence. 458 01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.630 huda: I mean. 459 01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.809 huda: maybe, like. 460 01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:38.870 huda: maybe I can kind of change the wording so that it's like I am the whiteboard. And like I help people like 461 01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.810 huda: learn things, because, like, I help them 462 01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:45.209 huda: through different ways. And like, people can 463 01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:49.339 huda: use what they're taught and like, actually turn it into knowledge. 464 01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:50.450 huda: But 465 01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:54.850 huda: yeah, I'm not sure how to implement that, like I am the whiteboard, I guess. 466 01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:56.110 Jenny Duan: What about this? 467 01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:02.199 Jenny Duan: I believe in leveraging my adaptability to teach others to think, explore, and draw their own connections. 468 01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:06.910 huda: Yeah, that sounds like a lot more like focused on me than yeah. 469 01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.230 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 470 01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:15.969 Jenny Duan: wait. I'm gonna take away. Think here, because they say it right here. Okay, to explore and draw their own connections. I think that's good. 471 01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:26.610 Jenny Duan: And I also think here from just make these a little bit more specific, maybe like from a mother cooking. 472 01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:33.840 Jenny Duan: What's another food like? Not Biryani like another food specific to like, because this is like the most right. 473 01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.670 huda: maybe, like, just none. 474 01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.769 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, write that down. 475 01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:49.120 Jenny Duan: you know, for a family to a okay. What other? What? What else would someone be doing? 476 01:05:50.570 --> 01:06:01.830 Jenny Duan: Kind of stuff like maybe gardener at the Park, or like you would say something that relates like something that's a little more specific to your community or like to Mountain House. I don't know what's like a 477 01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:07.410 Jenny Duan: maybe not at a park, you would say. Like if your town in Portland, I would say, like the rose garden, but like 478 01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.050 Jenny Duan: on more specific situation, you know. 479 01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.320 huda: I mean, we, I think, like 480 01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:22.359 huda: we don't have like any other facilities. But like we randomly like, we have like firefighters. 481 01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:25.930 huda: And so like. Maybe, like the firefighters. 482 01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:36.879 huda: We have like a specific event which is like like the community members can have like breakfast with like the firefighters. So maybe like that. 483 01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:42.499 huda: But I don't know if it makes sense to like people that are not from here. 484 01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:46.960 huda: Hmm! 485 01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.660 Jenny Duan: Okay, huh? 486 01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:55.249 Jenny Duan: But I feel like Farmer at the Park is, I mean, sorry not farmer gardener at the Park is that's also fine. 487 01:06:55.450 --> 01:07:02.089 Jenny Duan: It's like, but I think it could be like a little more if you can think of an analogy. But it's also like fine. If you can't. 488 01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:04.690 huda: Maybe a vendor at the farmers market. 489 01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 490 01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:19.280 Jenny Duan: but like, okay. But why? Why is that an illustration of kindness? I feel like, that's just like a person standing there. Right? That's not necessarily like a kind thing. 491 01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.390 huda: I mean, like the local, like. 492 01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:38.430 huda: boba spot like they give out like. Sometimes they give out like free drinks during like really hot days. 493 01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.139 huda: can you? But I don't. 494 01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:48.190 huda: Sorry. What did he say? 495 01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:55.159 Jenny Duan: I was. Gonna say, can you write that down? But if that example doesn't feel like the best to you, we can think of something else. 496 01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.800 huda: I feel like I can't word that really quickly, like. 497 01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:23.679 Jenny Duan: That what you mean like the I don't know. I don't know what you exactly meant by the brunch. 498 01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:25.779 huda: Yeah, that's pretty much it. Yeah. 499 01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:28.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, well, this is 250 words. 500 01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.300 Jenny Duan: and that's perfect. 501 01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.770 Jenny Duan: Oh, I'm so happy for you, Huda. I feel like this is really good. 502 01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.313 huda: Thank you. 503 01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:55.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, I think next up, have your dad read this and see what he thinks. I think it's also it's just like good to have more eyes on your essay, because, like, since we've been looking at this for so long, it's like we might not notice something that, like someone new would would notice. So also, I would say, have your sister read it when she comes. 504 01:08:56.036 --> 01:09:00.999 Jenny Duan: I think she, since she's gone through the process, she might be able to give you some advice, too, or like 505 01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:05.399 Jenny Duan: identify a part that feels sticky. But I feel like this is quite good for 506 01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.779 Jenny Duan: for now. 507 01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:22.459 huda: Yeah, thank you. And oh, so this is like, these, are this like my activity list? I put like the description for all of them. But yeah, I just wanna like, make sure they're like all set before, like, I submit. Unc. 508 01:09:22.788 --> 01:09:32.801 huda: And like, actually, I haven't done. I haven't like written down like my honors yet as well, so I think I need to work on that as well. I mean, like I have the list. But 509 01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.659 huda: I think like I need to write it down so it's like fit for the common app. 510 01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:48.949 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. Can you write down those hours? And then, once you're done with that, can you send me a text? And then I can look at this asynchronously, and then at their next session, we could talk about it if anything comes up. But just like 511 01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:52.007 Jenny Duan: glancing at this, it looks quite good. 512 01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:58.040 Jenny Duan: Oh, the other thing I want to ask you about is, have you? Submitted Disney dreamers? I think you can just submit it whenever you're ready. 513 01:09:58.310 --> 01:10:02.780 huda: Yeah, I did after you just checked my essays. I submitted those. 514 01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.860 Jenny Duan: Alright great 515 01:10:04.231 --> 01:10:05.840 Jenny Duan: so I can check these 516 01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.800 Jenny Duan: whenever you put the hours in. Just let me know. And then 517 01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:33.469 Jenny Duan: I think those are our next steps during our next meeting. I think we should. I want to go back to your Stanford supplements and also the Uc. Supplements. I feel like that's good. And then, since we're really ahead, I feel like we have extra time. We can talk about elks, Mvs scholars if you have time this week, or I don't know about this week, like today or tomorrow. Could you take a look at those questions 518 01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:38.179 Jenny Duan: and like start brainstorming? I don't think I think it's like, maybe one essay that you can use your content for 519 01:10:38.821 --> 01:10:44.238 Jenny Duan: the Elks it's called Elks. Mvs. It's a scholarship program. 520 01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.019 Jenny Duan: okay? And then for our next meeting. 521 01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:55.470 Jenny Duan: I was thinking a Sunday, if that works for you would be like the best time for me. 522 01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:07.820 huda: Yeah, I think Sunday works as well. I'll confirm like the timing with you, cause I think like my sister's going at that time, so I'm not sure like what timing I'll be unavailable. But I'll like I'll 523 01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:10.079 huda: ask, and then I'll let you know. After the call. 524 01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.899 Jenny Duan: Alright sounds good, then. Great progress, and I will see you soon. 525 01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:24.359 huda: Oh, yeah, one thing I wanted to add, like the Northeastern, like, application doesn't have any like supplementals. So I was thinking, I can just like submit it. Now. 526 01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah, just a minute. Oh, wait, actually, wait. No. 527 01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:30.490 Jenny Duan: Wait until I look at your activities list. Sorry? Yeah. 528 01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:35.070 Jenny Duan: But after that, yeah, great. Okay. Take care. Bye.",

Can you say something? 5 00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.509 huda: Oh! Can you hear me? 6 00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.548 Jenny Duan: Oh, yes, great! I can hear you sounds good. How's your day going. 7 00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:03.310 huda: It's going great! My sister's coming back from college, so be excited about that. 8 00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:21.690 Jenny Duan: That's awesome. Yeah. Well, it's nice to see you. I feel like we should just get started. Is there? Did you wanna start with reviewing, like what aspect of your Stanford fundamental or Unc. 9 00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.719 huda: I think, like the 2 most important things right now are the personal statement and the unc supplementals. 10 00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:34.199 huda: I just I had like like. I talked to my dad about my personal statement, and he just had like one 11 00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.189 huda: kind of thing he wanted to add, so let me go to the document. 12 00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.620 huda: yeah. So first, st let me put something good. Actually. 13 00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.040 huda: like the 1st half of it. 14 00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.159 huda: Over here. 15 00:05:52.993 --> 00:06:04.200 huda: From like when I'm talking about how video games like taught me like data science. And then video games taught me like how to juggle between different identities like 16 00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:13.709 huda: like that one like my dad really liked that one, and he said that was like, really, it shows my curiosity. And he said this second half, it's like 17 00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:19.189 huda: really, really different from like the 1st half. And he felt like it was like 2 different essays. 18 00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:23.3",
    "10 huda: Like. He said that this bottom one was a lot more like 19 00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.479 huda: he didn't really see the connection with like how video games like 20 00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:48.720 huda: taught me like, like different things like data science and like juggling between identities. And then I suddenly started talking about like how I develop games. I I think I tried explaining that like this is my way of showing like how I'm combating this change like with this problem. But I think he's just a bit confused like, why, like, the problem comes in. In the 1st place. 21 00:06:49.168 --> 00:06:55.069 huda: and then he had some like a few, a few like different kind of like things to say like, for example. 22 00:06:55.492 --> 00:07:14.769 huda: this bit with, like the technical jargon at hackathons and advocacy at journalism conferences. He felt like it was just kind of like a resume dump. But I I don't think so. I don't know. But yeah, like he just felt like the whole this part, and like everything below that, like they didn't connect apparently. 23 00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:29.590 Jenny Duan: Alright. I think that this part doesn't feel like an I mean doesn't feel like a resume job. It feels good because you want to just give them like those pins of the other things that you're doing. As for the connection. 24 00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.380 Jenny Duan: see, isn't 25 00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.933 Jenny Duan: I feel like here. This connection makes sense. 26 00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.920 Jenny Duan: It's maybe it. 27 00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:45.921 Jenny Duan: Maybe this could be maybe this transition, I think from here to Singapore could be a little bit smoother. 28 00:07:47.120 --> 00:08:01.129 Jenny Duan: yeah, I can see definitely the critique that, like it doesn't right here you're talking about characters represent you. But here this sentence connects to here. But this sentence doesn't necessarily connect to the previous paragraph. 29 00:08:01.430 --> 00",
    ":08:02.460 Jenny Duan: So 30 00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.360 Jenny Duan: maybe you could emphasize like, why, you are teaching data, science 31 00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:16.880 Jenny Duan: and this goes back to like what we talked about earlier, which is like, why are these issues so important to you. 32 00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:36.840 huda: Yeah, so like this 1st sentence here. I would focus on like the reason why I developed it or like, do you think I should change this 1st part, like Synthoria, was born out of that realization because that was like, I guess my way of just addressing like oh, like, because of this realization that 33 00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:51.749 huda: I couldn't find characters who resembled me. But I guess I kind of see how like then I just talk about instead of talking about the representation aspect that I bring with some story I talk about like the data science and AI ethics. So I can see like how that 34 00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:59.000 huda: like might not make sense. So instead of saying like this, should I just like replace it by something about like 35 00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.200 huda: how? Why, I created diverse 36 00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.079 huda: characters? Maybe. 37 00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.130 Jenny Duan: And what if we just put this here 38 00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:16.160 Jenny Duan: an Rpg that teaches data science, and maybe here we have an opportunity to be more specific. So 39 00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.890 Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna make a note here. But what's going out of that realization 40 00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.540 Jenny Duan: and then period change this to a period 41 00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:38.100 Jenny Duan: as I created my characters. But as I created my characters I hesitated. How's that? I feel like? Then it takes the focus away from like the data science part, and like it still mentions it, but it doesn't make the focus instead. 42 00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.020 huda: Yeah, yeah, I think that sounds better. Actually. 43 ",
    "00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.847 Jenny Duan: And then maybe we should. I think here we could be a little bit more specific, like 44 00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.300 Jenny Duan: an Rpg that teaches data, science and ethics like, why 45 00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.590 Jenny Duan: 2 young children, or like, maybe you can add a couple more words here to be a bit more descriptive about like 46 00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.410 Jenny Duan: why Sidora is important, or why you chose to create Sudoria. 47 00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.715 huda: Yeah. 48 00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.200 huda: maybe like 49 00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:11.409 huda: to bring young girls to the forefront of technological, like innovation like 50 00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.869 huda: that might be like a little too 51 00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.570 huda: like wordy. But. 52 00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.230 Jenny Duan: We, the Rpg, I developed to introduce 53 00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.860 Jenny Duan: young students to 54 00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.600 Jenny Duan: fundamental 55 00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.309 Jenny Duan: data science and AI ethics concepts 56 00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.400 Jenny Duan: missing from traditional curriculum. 57 00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.280 Jenny Duan: All of this. 58 00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.580 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Is it curriculum like? Is that. 59 00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.630 huda: It's curriculum. 60 00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.209 Jenny Duan: Yeah, curricula is the plural form. 61 00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:12.430 huda: And so over here, where it says, like, born out of that realization. Do you think I should like reiterate, like what that realization is or no? 62 00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.969 Jenny Duan: You're fine because it now it's like the most. 63 00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:30.410 Jenny Duan: But I do know I don't. I don't know if this M. Dash part is supposed to be too long. So maybe I'm thinking it might be a little long. So try to shorten it. A couple of words that would be great. 64 00:12",
    ":00.200 --> 00:12:01.940 Jenny Duan: Oh. 65 00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:14.700 Jenny Duan: okay, okay, I think this is fine. Actually, yeah, what do you think. 66 00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.280 huda: Yeah, I don't think there's any other way to like word it. 67 00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. 68 00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.800 Jenny Duan: okay. 69 00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.400 Jenny Duan: I don't know about this. 70 00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.327 Jenny Duan: Let me think. 71 00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:39.145 huda: Connected to 72 00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.020 huda: like the rest. So. 73 00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:56.924 huda: and also I feel like the prompt might not fit, because, like the last bit asked like, what or who do you turn to when you want to learn more? And 74 00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.870 huda: that I don't know if I address that in the essay. 75 00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:25.649 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can like I feel like, who do you turn to? One obvious answer in my mind is like your sister right, and I feel like centering is like pretty cool parallels with you and your sister. Maybe you can bring that in somehow. I don't know if it seems like a bit overdone or villainizing to talk about like Ashley and Evo, or like I don't know if that's like 76 00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.589 Jenny Duan: I don't like. I don't know how that reads like until that. 77 00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.440 huda: Hmm. 78 00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.030 huda: maybe like. 79 00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:59.640 Jenny Duan: Not villainizing is not the right word, but if the theme is like too simple or too not complex, like, for example, like, you know, like the school lunch anecdote that a lot of people are like. Oh, my school lunch smells bad because I'm reading like that's an example of a trope that, while true, is like. 80 00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.550 Jenny Duan: do you know what? I'm referencing or sorry? 81 00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:21.375 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. Well, one common story in like Asi",
    "an American narratives is just like, okay, like, maybe I brought like kimchi to school or something, and it like smells bad, or like someone writes like, Oh, maybe I brought curry to school, and like, I wish I brought like a or something that's like a very common trope 82 00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:34.470 Jenny Duan: And while it's like a very powerful story, it's just been told so many times that like to some people, it feels overdone. So I don't want your your story, which I don't think it feels this way, but I don't want it to seem like trope like if that makes sense. 83 00:14:36.387 --> 00:14:43.340 huda: Also. Yeah. Also, I do agree that like, maybe I don't need to like straight out. Say Ashley and ava 84 00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:45.470 huda: because that might like 85 00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.680 huda: like. 86 00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, what if your reviewers name is a power, Ashley? Not that that is like a bad thing, but like, you know, something like that. 87 00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.884 huda: It sounds hostile. Then 88 00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.909 huda: maybe just like 89 00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.319 huda: or play it safe. 90 00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:19.229 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I don't think the concern was necessarily about playing it safe. I believe it's more like the other thing that maybe is an issue with that discussion of Ashley and Eva is that it takes the conversation like away from 91 00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:26.069 Jenny Duan: your experience, and just like makes it too much about your game without the like. Focus on 92 00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:37.059 Jenny Duan: like too much of the game without focus on your work. I mean, obviously the games of product. But like you don't want to be like about intricacies of the game, and it's more so about like what you did. 93 00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.540 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 94 00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:51.489 Jenny Duan: is there another? Is there another analogy you can use here instead of ",
    "this. So I still feel like 95 00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:57.910 Jenny Duan: like this, play it safe rather than stand out like that is good. This is all good. 96 00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.660 Jenny Duan: maybe just change these 2 sentences and 97 00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.110 Jenny Duan: these 98 00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.309 Jenny Duan: to send these 2 sentences. What do you think. 99 00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:10.080 huda: So what would I change it to like like? 100 00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:19.239 huda: I mean, like, the main problem was like like deciding. If I should like make them diverse characters or underrepresented characters. 101 00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:30.450 huda: And like, I feel like this like I could do something different than like the names. But I feel like the main point of it was to show that I had to choose between, like, 102 00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.750 huda: like, like 103 00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:45.890 huda: putting people in a role that like they're not usually used to and like that was mainly for the diversity inclusion part. But yeah, like, I wouldn't know to like, replace this with. 104 00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.180 Jenny Duan: it's funny. 105 00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.990 Jenny Duan: I hesitated today. 106 00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.480 Jenny Duan: should I? 107 00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:34.089 Jenny Duan: Respond from that realization? Maybe instead of writing about your hesitation, you can just say, like as I created my characters, I intentionally made the choice to like. I like I thought about like my sister, or like I don't know how you can address this in a more eloquent way, but, like you can talk instead of like talking about the struggle, you can just say, like you made this decision intentionally to use diverse characters in your fame, because it represented like a fundamental aspect of who you are or something that inspires you. 108 00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.090 Jenny Duan: And then from that you could talk about like 109 00:17:37.410 --> 00:1",
    "7:44.249 Jenny Duan: the impact that this had, for example, in like that one classroom, or that that one teacher that responded to you, or something like that. 110 00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.819 Jenny Duan: and like. 111 00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.389 Jenny Duan: why, that's unfortunate. 112 00:17:47.660 --> 00:18:00.186 huda: This, but, like my no, my only concern is that like earlier, you mentioned that like, I'm supposed to show kind of like my growth and like how I came to like like a larger realization. And then 113 00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:14.450 huda: I guess I don't know if, like the part where like, I'm realizing like, Oh, I'm not like really I guess, like representative video games. I should make a video game like with my characters and just knowing immediately, like, I don't know if that shows enough growth. 114 00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.580 huda: or like like ability to overcome a struggle. 115 00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense. 116 00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.420 Jenny Duan: I'm doing. 117 00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:39.469 Jenny Duan: i i i also like it just as it is right now. I feel like it's true to you and like. 118 00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.670 Jenny Duan: I don't know if it's like worth going through all this to like 119 00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:53.560 Jenny Duan: potentially try to make someone else feel more comfortable when you don't think that your essay makes them. I don't think your essay is 120 00:18:54.876 --> 00:19:02.530 Jenny Duan: in terms of like, I know he's the admissions officer by like you know more play, but I think it's like good as is honestly 121 00:19:03.264 --> 00:19:04.780 Jenny Duan: with that analogy. 122 00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.399 huda: Yeah, I I personally liked it. I I just think. 123 00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.570 huda: maybe like. 124 00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:22.109 huda: like, Oh, yeah. Also, my dad did not like this sentence over here, video games. Quickly. 125 00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.680 Jenny",
    " Duan: One. 126 00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.080 huda: Whisper 127 00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:35.750 huda: because of kind of like curiosity, like just saying that you're curious. A curious like kind of just kind of says that you're not curious. 128 00:19:44.001 --> 00:20:00.660 Jenny Duan: What's another way you could. 129 00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.689 huda: I mean, this one might be too vague, but, like 130 00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:11.509 huda: video games quickly became like the foundation of for my identity. But, like. 131 00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.869 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's not really the foundation. 132 00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:25.460 Jenny Duan: yeah. 133 00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.290 huda: I don't know. I don't know how else to word it. But 134 00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.200 huda: yeah. 135 00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.339 Jenny Duan: Like, okay, let's look at this essay. This is one of my favorite essays that's like 136 00:20:33.842 --> 00:20:38.049 Jenny Duan: pretty similar to yours, like it's like him building some things. 137 00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.029 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 138 00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.010 huda: I think we read this essay before. 139 00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.660 Jenny Duan: Yeah, we have. 140 00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.900 Jenny Duan: But like. 141 00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.219 huda: Yeah, I'll reach again. 142 00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.789 Jenny Duan: It's like, it's like him doing something. 143 00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah, here's like the solution discussion. 144 00:21:31.935 --> 00:21:32.630 Jenny Duan: And 145 00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:40.461 Jenny Duan: now I'm gonna pause the screen. But go back to your essay. 146 00:21:59.455 --> 00:22:09.309 Jenny Duan: I think here. 147 00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:15.580 Jenny Duan: you should make this more like, I developed synthoria. 148 00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.640 Jenny Duan: Make it more human. First.st 149 00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.460 Jenny Duan: Sure. 150 00:22:22.000 --> 00:2",
    "2:22.680 Jenny Duan: Okay. 151 00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.345 Jenny Duan: thanks. 152 00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:41.810 Jenny Duan: Okay. 153 00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.180 huda: Hmm. 154 00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:04.109 huda: yeah, I'm not. I'm trying to like, I'm trying to find like where I can improve it, because 155 00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.159 huda: I don't know. I 156 00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:12.980 huda: don't like, I feel like the only problem was like the connection, maybe. But like I I think 157 00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.120 huda: I think it's not too bad. 158 00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.250 Jenny Duan: I think we fix that problem just by moving this on. 159 00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.999 huda: Okay. Then I. 160 00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.949 Jenny Duan: Good. I just. I changed the sentence like, video games really became the launching point for my questions. I don't know if this launching point is the right word. But 161 00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.183 Jenny Duan: maybe, like. 162 00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.300 huda: Maybe, like 163 00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:05.299 huda: video like, answer these questions almost cause like when I'm not bound to one narrative, one language, one rule. I'm like a gamer, I guess, and like 164 00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:17.770 huda: I have all these different roles through video games. So in a way, it answered like, Oh, how do I do my math homework. How do I like? Who am I when I'm not bounded by all these like one of these and identities? 165 00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.070 huda: I think it kind of became like an answer to those questions. 166 00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.033 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 167 00:24:33.356 --> 00:24:35.679 Jenny Duan: We. 168 00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.654 huda: Maybe for this, to make more sense, I can like add a question 169 00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:47.589 huda: near like the math problem part, so that like they'll understand like, oh, these questions are being answered by video games, and they'll see that pattern. Maybe. 170 00:24:47",
    ".840 --> 00:24:49.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Why don't you add that ready? 171 00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:50.870 huda: Yeah. 172 00:25:05.071 --> 00:25:06.940 huda: should I replace this with like. 173 00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.680 huda: or just like, delete this and then write the question. 174 00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.919 huda: I'm faced with a tricky, graphing problem. 175 00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:22.499 Jenny Duan: I don't know if we need to replace. We'll try adding the question first, st and then we'll see if we have extra words. Too many words. 176 00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.829 huda: I don't know if this is the right question. 177 00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:49.069 Jenny Duan: I feel like, maybe not, adding, maybe you don't need to add a question here, because it's still so far from 178 00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.670 Jenny Duan: down here. 179 00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.200 huda: Like. I don't know if. 180 00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.380 Jenny Duan: Like the reader will understand the connection. 181 00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.630 huda: And should I keep? I feel like this should be like separate paragraph. 182 00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.510 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree. 183 00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:51.719 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like I, I looked for solutions in the games I played, or something, but like 184 00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.180 Jenny Duan: something about like 185 00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.730 Jenny Duan: I I still don't know if this is, this percentage is the best transition. 186 00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:07.069 huda: yeah, like, maybe, like, the wording is also like, so maybe like video, games. 187 00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.389 huda: for me, video games. 188 00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.640 huda: Answered these these questions. 189 00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:38.280 huda: And I but then I feel like it also loses the connection of this part like, I didn't constitute video games, because then that doesn't like really relate to like video games, video games. Answering my questions. 190 00:27",
    ":48.280 --> 00:27:52.290 Jenny Duan: What's an example of a missing character being little colonized in a video game. 191 00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:55.260 huda: Sorry. What did you say? 192 00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.690 Jenny Duan: What's an example of a Muslim character being villainized in a video game. 193 00:28:01.761 --> 00:28:13.109 huda: Like, for example, in call of duty. I think I already mentioned it, but like there's plenty of characters with like Muslim names which are often like radicalized 194 00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.739 huda: and then I'm trying to think of some examples. But 195 00:28:20.455 --> 00:28:21.130 huda: yeah. 196 00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.520 Jenny Duan: Okay. 197 00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.080 Jenny Duan: are you. 198 00:28:31.936 --> 00:28:33.030 huda: Let's called. 199 00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.700 Jenny Duan: No. 200 00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.210 Jenny Duan: let's see 201 00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.820 Jenny Duan: 6. 202 00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:27.660 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if this would be like a clear connection here, because I don't know. Maybe if you don't reference, a specific character. It might just feel like an over generalization. 203 00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:33.209 huda: I had like so like another thing I could have said is like 5% being Asian. 204 00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.939 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe that would be better. 205 00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:40.169 Jenny Duan: Maybe instead of this sentence, you can just say. 206 00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.899 huda: It's not better if I said, do they reflect who I am? 207 00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:48.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, yeah. 208 00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:31.539 Jenny Duan: wait. I'm not sure if this is exactly this, these 2 sentences are smooth now, because it feels like it's saying, like you developed it from this realization. But then, like you go back and you say, like, here's the problem again, like you're like solution. And then the problem like, I don't know if that makes sense, b",
    "ut it doesn't feel as smooth saying like, you developed it from this realization, and after reading this I maybe would expect to hear more about like 209 00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:37.049 Jenny Duan: what that entailed. But then you go back to like describing the problem. After that. 210 00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:57.030 huda: Yeah, I can see that. But like, I wanted to show that like, even though I realized that, like my community was like underrepresented in games. I still hesitated because of like these different like things like, for example, if people would relate, or if, like their names, would even be pronounceable for other people. 211 00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:00.439 huda: But then, like I realized, and then I said, like 212 00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:05.820 huda: no, just to bring representation. 213 00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:11.192 Jenny Duan: Right. That makes sense.

You never truly know who you are, so I feel like it's still too, general.

Something from that tone. Maybe not that exact sentence, just like something with that. 250 00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.200 huda: Begun my ongoing search. 251 00:35:47.230 -->",
    " 00:35:56.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like this shows like a clear problem statement, too, because as you're going through the search like, you're not able to find 252 00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.450 Jenny Duan: sorry. 253 00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:43.139 huda: Wait. Is there? Is there like a bad side to using, like the common app prompt, which just says, like, share an essay on on any topic of your choice. It could be anyone that you've written, one that responds to a different, prompt, or one of your own designs. 254 00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.609 Jenny Duan: I don't think there's anything that. 255 00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:54.610 huda: Then I think that might be better, because, this one, I'd have to like tweak it a lot so that 256 00:36:55.025 --> 00:37:00.049 huda: I could fit in the aspect with my sister. And also I don't think I don't think 257 00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:13.380 huda: like I know, there's like a parallelism with like video games. But then I feel like I wouldn't ask my sister for help to like show, like, how to like, learn more about how video games can impact you cause like 258 00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:18.939 huda: like.

I think so. I don't know if it'll fit that prompt. 261 00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:34.779 Jenny Duan: That makes a lot of sense. In that case, I feel like you can just use that general pump. I don't think there's anything like that. 262 00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:36.690 huda: Okay. Then. 263 00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.989 Jenny Duan: Sorry.

And it he felt. 274 00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.260 Jenny Duan: It's the 1st bit. 275 00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.390 huda: Right here. Felt like kind of 276 00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:52.879 huda: innocent. He described it because, like, because, like looking at the world and like, I'm seeing like this many pixels, and like that helped me, and then, like the example with, like the Minecraft, and like the math homework like, I think he really enjoyed like how I was kind of showing like these different aspects like this kind of already shows that I'm a problem solver. And then it shows about like my different identities and like ability to like balance and then I feel like already kind of fixed it. But he just like 277 00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.730 huda: you, wanna can you imagine like this part was like when I was younger. 278 00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.490 huda: and then he imagined, like this part. 279 00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:01.080 Jenny Duan: It's very cool. 280 00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.280 huda: Now I'm doing like all these workshops and things. But 281 00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:08.479 huda: like, yeah, maybe I can like mention my age here now. 282 00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.230 huda: maybe like I feel like at at 16. 283 00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:27.040 huda: Yeah. And then I think that'll that would fix the problem. Because I think he was just like he didn't see that like I go from ",
    "there, and he just he just kind of got shocked that like 284 00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.379 huda: it went from like 285 00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:32.550 huda: homework. And like these different things like me developing whole game. 286 00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.299 huda: But yeah, I think 287 00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.510 huda: like mentioning the game plan. 288 00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.340 huda: But. 289 00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:50.449 Jenny Duan: I feel like, since we fix these 2 these couple sentences it, I think the transition does. 290 00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:51.859 huda: I think he he really liked it. 291 00:40:53.440 --> 00:41:00.428 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. So now we just have a couple of ports. Just fine. Let's just fix that. 292 00:41:01.243 --> 00:41:02.030 Jenny Duan: I think. 293 00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.619 huda: It's 2 words over. 294 00:41:04.547 --> 00:41:07.329 Jenny Duan: Thank for me. 295 00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:08.210 huda: Oh!

But like 302 00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:13.540 Jenny Duan: you just like, sometimes you just move on, because again, like admissions officers, they're spending like, maybe 5 min.

They'd like, write down everything that they know. 340 00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:30.449 huda: They like, make connection between all the different things that they learned. And then they actually apply it. And it's a lot more helpful like when you're actually needing this information. And for example, like 341 00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:42.029 huda: textbooks really just like, give information. But like whiteboard is where it can tests you if like. You know this, and it like it actually like puts what you know onto like the 342 00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.120 huda: like slate. I guess. 343 00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:53.689 Jenny Duan: Alright. Okay. I just added this. Rather. I feel like that may be 344 00:47:54.270 --> 00:48:04.938 Jenny Duan: makes the connection a little bit smoother. I like this where instruction becomes smaller.

It's like you encouraging them in these new learning strategies. 370 00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.590 huda: Maybe something like 371 00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:01.664 huda: I don't know. This would be too repetitive. But I want to say, like my instruction. 372 00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:04.849 huda: turned to knowledge 373 00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.250 huda: as 374 00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.680 huda: there 375 00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:16.080 huda: ideas came to life. 376 00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.549 huda: this might be too broad, or like vague. 377 00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:39.870 huda: sure. 378 00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:18.679 Jenny Duan: Does Unc really value like learning by doing something that they emphasize. Because one thing, I don't want to villainize like textbook style learning, because, like, maybe, like a lot of their, a lot of their classes are, if their philosophy is on textbook style. Learning like you don't just don't want to like you want to be careful there. But did you. 379 00:53:24.759 --> 00:53:28.059 huda: I don't know about how to go about this sentence. 380 00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:29.360 huda: Hmm. 381 00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.140 huda: and also, yeah, this sentence might be like villainizing textbooks. 382 00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.320 huda: but. 383 00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:44.649 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because I get how this is like a fun analogy. But we just don't want to like villainize. Let's see, what sentence are you having struggl",
    "e with right now. 384 00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.410 huda: Here. 385 00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 386 00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.480 Jenny Duan: the chaos between. 387 00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.269 Jenny Duan: maybe, like 388 00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.426 Jenny Duan: evolving into. 389 00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:11.810 Jenny Duan: yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. 390 00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:13.680 huda: Oh, yeah. 391 00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:23.629 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. Let's go back to this textbook insight. I'm not. Yeah, I don't. I don't know about this. 392 00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:24.530 huda: Yeah. 393 00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:27.359 Jenny Duan: Like they learned by twig. He cut out this. 394 00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:43.949 huda: And then should I? I think, the sentence the sentence afterwards should connect it to Whiteboards. 395 00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:46.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 396 00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.493 Jenny Duan: thank you. 397 00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.430 Jenny Duan: Okay. 398 00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:14.949 Jenny Duan: okay, yeah. I'd love to see this textbook analogy more throughout, but without making the textbooks villainizing. 399 00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.719 huda: I don't know how to. I don't have a 400 00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.990 huda: connect it back to the 401 00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.140 huda: let me see. 402 00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.010 huda: let's see. 403 00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.580 huda: Maybe like 404 00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:57.510 huda: I can write about like how 405 00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.270 huda: by making choices. They 406 00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.040 huda: like 407 00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.440 huda: draw connections like that on the whiteboard. 408 00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:11.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe I don't know. I 409 00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.960 Jenny Duan: I don't know if it would be better if you move this above the centuria 410 00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.790 Jenny Duan: ntoria. One. 411 00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.",
    "990 huda: Yeah, maybe 412 00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:41.039 huda: cause I also feel like the best way to explain, like the benefit of like Whiteboards is that it's like it's internalized. But I don't wanna like repeat that like over and over. 413 00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:55.589 huda: or would that or could that be like even like repetition? Maybe like like, for example. 414 00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:56.770 huda: where 415 00:57:57.921 --> 00:58:07.610 huda: entrepreneurship is internalized, not taught. And then, like the last one could be like for data. Science is intern or like 416 00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:14.990 huda: data, sciences internalized, not taught like. Maybe it could be like a matter of like repetition, or like parallelism. 417 00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:19.800 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what would you use? What would you repeat like a phrase, or a sentence, or a question. 418 00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:26.199 huda: Yeah, this specific part, like evolving into space where kindness is internalized, not taught. 419 00:58:26.634 --> 00:58:28.999 huda: It could be just something like 420 00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.790 huda: like something like that. I don't know if it looks out of place. 421 00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:02.229 Jenny Duan: I feel like the repetitiveness doesn't flow. Well. 422 01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.810 Jenny Duan: how's that? 423 01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:23.230 Jenny Duan: Okay? 424 01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.759 huda: Yeah, I like the clothing sentence. It sounds really great. 425 01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.650 Jenny Duan: Okay. 426 01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:52.019 Jenny Duan: I feel like, just I feel like it just by moving this like the the flip part. I feel like it feels a lot more smoother here because it's like here, like you talked about sharing stories and inspiring others. Then, like you continue that, and then the learn by doing is like a good connection to the beginning. 427 01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.369 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's sweet now. 428 01:00:54.400 --> 01:0",
    "0:56.465 Jenny Duan: I don't know what are your thoughts. 429 01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.169 huda: Yeah, I agree. But do you think that like 430 01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:10.750 huda: cause I don't know. I don't really think that the whiteboard is like an analogy for like the whole thing but but like, I don't know if it's like being reflected in every paragraph enough. But like 431 01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:12.100 huda: what do you think. 432 01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.510 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine, because. 433 01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:22.440 Jenny Duan: like the theme is not just the whiteboard, it's it's like about how learning like doing is more valuable than. And then like 434 01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:29.870 Jenny Duan: saying, Well, it's like learning by doing right. And you mentioned that here you mentioned like inspiring others. Here I feel like it's 435 01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:35.289 Jenny Duan: it flows. Well, I mean, it's like you only have 2 50 words. So they're not gonna forget the analogy by the end. 436 01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.500 huda: Yeah. 437 01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:43.220 Jenny Duan: Wait this out loud, and then from there we can see if there's anything that maybe sticks when you say it out loud. 438 01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.610 huda: Textbooks are overrated. Rather whiteboards are the grounds where instruction becomes knowledge. 439 01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.780 huda: Every Sunday morning I face a room of squirming kids at my local mosque 440 01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:00.690 huda: most weeks. As I read out the lesson plan, I notice 21 pairs of eyes concentrated on the ceiling walls, the floor 441 01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:02.429 huda: anywhere but the lesson. 442 01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:18.280 huda: One week I decided to make a change with an expo marker and a dream. I stand in front of the classroom calling each student. I ask, what! What does kindness look like from mother cooking food for her family? To a gardener at the park, drawing slowly enveloped the ",
    "whiteboard. 443 01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.900 huda: the chaos becomes chatter and laughter, evolving into a space where kindness is internalized, not taught. 444 01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:33.240 huda: After service. I penned stories of Muslim entrepreneurs in my rural town like a software engineer selling Biryani from his garage 445 01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:40.700 huda: writing for youth newspapers. I help these small business business owners share their stories and inspire others. 446 01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:46.899 huda: I continue this philosophy in synthoria. A video game I created to teach girls about AI and ethics 447 01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:48.709 huda: rather than handling them. 448 01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:51.110 huda: Then handling 449 01:02:54.410 --> 01:03:04.820 huda: them answers. I designed a world where players navigate moral dilemmas. Should a robot lie to protect feelings, should I prioritize efficiency over empathy. 450 01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:21.519 huda: through their choices, they learn by doing whether it's a classroom, a newspaper, or a game. I believe in in creating space for others to think, explore, and draw their own connections. Textbooks may provide information, but whiteboards and the experiences that fill them, allow us to truly think. 451 01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:29.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, couple of questions here. So 1st of all, what personal quality are you emphasizing here. 452 01:03:30.584 --> 01:03:46.189 huda: I'm emphasizing like adaptability, and like in situations where like, for example, I think, like the Sunday school, one matches the best. But like I'll just like adapt to make sure that people can learn like, no matter in what media 453 01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.090 huda: and like. Also, I guess, like my ability to like teach people. I think that as well. 454 01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.509 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if that comes through. 455 01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:06.189 Jenny Duan: I think we should put. 456 01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.749",
    " Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like I feel like somewhere we should emphasize more of the youth. 457 01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:21.440 Jenny Duan: because it seems like these textbooks and whiteboards. It's an effective device. But we need to connect it back to you like, maybe you're just missing like a couple of words change or like what sentence. 458 01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.630 huda: I mean. 459 01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.809 huda: maybe, like. 460 01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:38.870 huda: maybe I can kind of change the wording so that it's like I am the whiteboard. And like I help people like 461 01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.810 huda: learn things, because, like, I help them 462 01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:45.209 huda: through different ways. And like, people can 463 01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:49.339 huda: use what they're taught and like, actually turn it into knowledge. 464 01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:50.450 huda: But 465 01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:54.850 huda: yeah, I'm not sure how to implement that, like I am the whiteboard, I guess. 466 01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:56.110 Jenny Duan: What about this? 467 01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:02.199 Jenny Duan: I believe in leveraging my adaptability to teach others to think, explore, and draw their own connections. 468 01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:06.910 huda: Yeah, that sounds like a lot more like focused on me than yeah. 469 01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.230 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 470 01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:15.969 Jenny Duan: wait. I'm gonna take away. Think here, because they say it right here. Okay, to explore and draw their own connections. I think that's good. 471 01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:26.610 Jenny Duan: And I also think here from just make these a little bit more specific, maybe like from a mother cooking. 472 01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:33.840 Jenny Duan: What's another food like? Not Biryani like another food specific to like, because this is like the most right. 473 01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.670 huda: maybe, like, just none. 474 01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.769 Jenny Duan:",
    " Yeah, okay, write that down. 475 01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:49.120 Jenny Duan: you know, for a family to a okay. What other? What? What else would someone be doing? 476 01:05:50.570 --> 01:06:01.830 Jenny Duan: Kind of stuff like maybe gardener at the Park, or like you would say something that relates like something that's a little more specific to your community or like to Mountain House. I don't know what's like a 477 01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:07.410 Jenny Duan: maybe not at a park, you would say. Like if your town in Portland, I would say, like the rose garden, but like 478 01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.050 Jenny Duan: on more specific situation, you know. 479 01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.320 huda: I mean, we, I think, like 480 01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:22.359 huda: we don't have like any other facilities. But like we randomly like, we have like firefighters. 481 01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:25.930 huda: And so like. Maybe, like the firefighters. 482 01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:36.879 huda: We have like a specific event which is like like the community members can have like breakfast with like the firefighters. So maybe like that. 483 01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:42.499 huda: But I don't know if it makes sense to like people that are not from here. 484 01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:46.960 huda: Hmm! 485 01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.660 Jenny Duan: Okay, huh? 486 01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:55.249 Jenny Duan: But I feel like Farmer at the Park is, I mean, sorry not farmer gardener at the Park is that's also fine. 487 01:06:55.450 --> 01:07:02.089 Jenny Duan: It's like, but I think it could be like a little more if you can think of an analogy. But it's also like fine. If you can't. 488 01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:04.690 huda: Maybe a vendor at the farmers market. 489 01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 490 01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:19.280 Jenny Duan: but like, okay. But why? Why is that an illustration of kindness? I feel like, that's just like a person standing there. Right? That's not necessarily like a ki",
    "nd thing. 491 01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.390 huda: I mean, like the local, like. 492 01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:38.430 huda: boba spot like they give out like. Sometimes they give out like free drinks during like really hot days. 493 01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.139 huda: can you? But I don't. 494 01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:48.190 huda: Sorry. What did he say? 495 01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:55.159 Jenny Duan: I was. Gonna say, can you write that down? But if that example doesn't feel like the best to you, we can think of something else. 496 01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.800 huda: I feel like I can't word that really quickly, like. 497 01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:23.679 Jenny Duan: That what you mean like the I don't know. I don't know what you exactly meant by the brunch. 498 01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:25.779 huda: Yeah, that's pretty much it. Yeah. 499 01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:28.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, well, this is 250 words. 500 01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.300 Jenny Duan: and that's perfect. 501 01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.770 Jenny Duan: Oh, I'm so happy for you, Huda. I feel like this is really good. 502 01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.313 huda: Thank you. 503 01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:55.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, I think next up, have your dad read this and see what he thinks. I think it's also it's just like good to have more eyes on your essay, because, like, since we've been looking at this for so long, it's like we might not notice something that, like someone new would would notice. So also, I would say, have your sister read it when she comes. 504 01:08:56.036 --> 01:09:00.999 Jenny Duan: I think she, since she's gone through the process, she might be able to give you some advice, too, or like 505 01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:05.399 Jenny Duan: identify a part that feels sticky. But I feel like this is quite good for 506 01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.779 Jenny Duan: for now. 507 01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:22.459 huda: Yeah, thank you. And oh, so this is like, these, are this like my activity list? I put like t",
    "he description for all of them. But yeah, I just wanna like, make sure they're like all set before, like, I submit. Unc. 508 01:09:22.788 --> 01:09:32.801 huda: And like, actually, I haven't done. I haven't like written down like my honors yet as well, so I think I need to work on that as well. I mean, like I have the list. But 509 01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.659 huda: I think like I need to write it down so it's like fit for the common app. 510 01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:48.949 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. Can you write down those hours? And then, once you're done with that, can you send me a text? And then I can look at this asynchronously, and then at their next session, we could talk about it if anything comes up. But just like 511 01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:52.007 Jenny Duan: glancing at this, it looks quite good. 512 01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:58.040 Jenny Duan: Oh, the other thing I want to ask you about is, have you? Submitted Disney dreamers? I think you can just submit it whenever you're ready. 513 01:09:58.310 --> 01:10:02.780 huda: Yeah, I did after you just checked my essays. I submitted those. 514 01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.860 Jenny Duan: Alright great 515 01:10:04.231 --> 01:10:05.840 Jenny Duan: so I can check these 516 01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.800 Jenny Duan: whenever you put the hours in. Just let me know. And then 517 01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:33.469 Jenny Duan: I think those are our next steps during our next meeting. I think we should. I want to go back to your Stanford supplements and also the Uc. Supplements. I feel like that's good. And then, since we're really ahead, I feel like we have extra time. We can talk about elks, Mvs scholars if you have time this week, or I don't know about this week, like today or tomorrow. Could you take a look at those questions 518 01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:38.179 Jenny Duan: and like start brainstorming?

    "he Elks it's called Elks. Mvs. It's a scholarship program. 520 01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.019 Jenny Duan: okay? And then for our next meeting. 521 01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:55.470 Jenny Duan: I was thinking a Sunday, if that works for you would be like the best time for me. 522 01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:07.820 huda: Yeah, I think Sunday works as well. I'll confirm like the timing with you, cause I think like my sister's going at that time, so I'm not sure like what timing I'll be unavailable. But I'll like I'll 523 01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:10.079 huda: ask, and then I'll let you know. After the call. 524 01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.899 Jenny Duan: Alright sounds good, then. Great progress, and I will see you soon. 525 01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:24.359 huda: Oh, yeah, one thing I wanted to add, like the Northeastern, like, application doesn't have any like supplementals. So I was thinking, I can just like submit it. Now. 526 01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah, just a minute. Oh, wait, actually, wait. No. 527 01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:30.490 Jenny Duan: Wait until I look at your activities list. Sorry? Yeah. 528 01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:35.070 Jenny Duan: But after that, yeah, great. Okay. Take care.
