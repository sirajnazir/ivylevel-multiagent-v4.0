How are you? 00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000 Good. Do you have this whole week off for break? 00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000 Yeah. 00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000 Oh, that's so nice. I do too. So I'm home in Portland. It's been pretty nice. 00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000 Well, it's good to see you. How have you been spending your break? How was your first day 00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000 So far, just… 00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000 working, I guess. I've been working 00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000 um on like the UC draft, because I don't know if that's just taking me a really long time because I can't 00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000 really indecisive about like my wording 00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000 And then like, I guess I kind of started a little bit of the mit 00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000 supplementals, but I guess it's just been kind of productive so yeah 00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000 Awesome. Well… 00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000 I mean, I think it's good to like have a break, but also I'm glad that, you know, you're still keeping up with everything. 00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000 So let me just. 00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Open up your UC document. 00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000 Is it just that one essay that you're still working on? 00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000 Yeah. Okay. 00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000 Let me go on the document. So I have 00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000 three kind of like different wording like this first one is just like, I just wrote like a different hook 00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000 And then these two are just like the same thing, but they're like worded a little differently. 00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000 Okay. 00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:08.000 Give me a second to read over these. 00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000 Okay. 00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000 Which one is your favorite so far? 00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000 I like this last one. 00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000 Okay, and why is that your favorite? 00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000 I feel like it's a little more like 00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000 kind of… 00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000 focusing more on my creativity i think 00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000 Mm-hmm. 00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000 And I think it's also a little more like it's a little less wordy and like 00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000 I feel like the other one's kind of verbose it's just like 00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000 packing a lot into one essay. 00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000 I love this first description. I think it's so engaging. 00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000 I also like this one the best too. 00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000 Great. 00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000 So… 00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000 I think the biggest thing is just emphasizing creativity throughout the story. So let me just read the rest of this. 00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000 Is there another way you can say this sentence instead of being so straightforward here? 00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000 Um… 00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000 Like, should I mention like journalism like explicitly and then maybe not saying like creative um journalism but 00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000 Should I mention journalism in this sentence? 00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000 Actually, I feel like in context it seems… 00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000 Fine. 00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:47.000 Okay. 00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:59.000 This is great. 00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000 I love this last sentence. 00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000 Thank you. 00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000 But it seems like you're writing more about paying attention than creativity. 00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000 So can you tell me specifically what makes this creative? 00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000 I think like I only really 00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000 Like, I think that's kind of my problem is that um i kind of address it but not completely 00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:42.000 And this one part where I talk about like pairing the hijabs boutique intricate designs with chronic purses or like talking about like the Afghan butcher who has to balance Islamic farming traditions and FDA regulations 00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000 I was kind of going for like 00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000 Shouldn't a juxtaposition, not juxtaposition but like 00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000 creating these stories so that they have like the context 00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000 and like um so like readers who aren't familiar with their background and like don't have these experiences so that they're able to understand 00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000 So kind of creating like creating 00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000 um like narrations that are accessible to everyone because these are like stories that need to be heard. 00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000 And like, how does that involve your own decision making or your own creativity? 00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000 It's like when I'm narrating it and like when I'm writing the story 00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000 And like, I guess the decisions also lie in like the questions that you ask 00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000 it's because like you need to make sure there's questions that can give like the readers a better understanding of like 00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000 like what made this person start their businesses and like what advice they have for like entrepreneurs and like 00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000 Kind of… 00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000 Framing. I think like framing is like my creative aspect of it 00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000 it's like… 00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000 making sure that it's like the right information is presented, I think. 00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:09.000 Okay, let me read over this one more time. 00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000 I'm just going to make sure all the verb tenses are the same. 00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000 Because… 00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000 here it's like, I think putting everything in present tense is best. 00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000 Actually. 00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:41.000 No, actually, you're fine doing it the way it was. Sorry. 00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000 It could be a little bit longer. Do you feel like you have any other words? It's okay if you want to keep it this length too. 00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000 I think 00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000 It might be helpful to extend a little bit because like you said, I don't know if like my creativity is really showing through so 00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000 Maybe I could like elaborate in this 00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000 I think this is like the paragraph which i think 00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000 My creativity is like most shown. 00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000 But like, yeah, I think I could elaborate more about 00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000 Like you said, like the decisions that i made maybe 00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000 So, like… 00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000 So like the sentence could be or like the information could be about like presenting 00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000 Like… 00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000 Yeah. 00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:59.000 Okay. 00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000 it's like, I think you should talk about like 00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000 Selecting which aspects of the story to focus on like 00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000 creating like a compelling narrative using descriptive language and like 00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000 Finding the unique ways to present information 00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000 I think that's like the creativity that comes 00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:31.000 alongside journalism. 00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000 So like the information presented to 00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000 I don't know how to word it, but I'm talking about like to make sure that the readers can like 00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000 really have like an understanding of like like why this business is like 00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000 that it is what it is. 00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000 Um. 00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:57.000 I guess I'm trying to say like to contextualize like the stories but 00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000 Say more. 00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000 Let me just write like 00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000 So the information presented to contextualize 00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000 their innovation, maybe? 00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000 Yeah. 00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000 To contextualize. 00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000 their innovation, yeah. 00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000 Creating compelling. And then I think you could use one word here 00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000 like tailoring or like 00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000 Something like that or like choosing or selecting or something that implies that you have control in that context. 00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000 Yeah. 00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000 or presenting the information maybe? 00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000 Yeah, exactly. 00:13:44.000 --> 00:14:01.000 I found it in creating compelling narratives, presenting the information to contextualize their innovation and 00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000 And… 00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000 craft their stories. 00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000 Yeah. 00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000 or prep journey something like that. 00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000 maybe like crafting a timeline of their journeys 00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:46.000 Yeah. 00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000 I think I mentioned creativity like creativity 00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000 Too many times because i think i mentioned it like 00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:00.000 Two times. 00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000 You mentioned it here and here, right? 00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000 Oh, yeah.

I wanted stories. 00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000 So I crossed everything out and scribbled one question. 00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000 What's your first memory in the kitchen? 00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000 But Franati didn't miss a beat. Her eyes lit up as she described her grandmother's biryani recipe, smuggled from India in a tattered diary. 00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000 Suddenly, her words were just answers. There were snapshots of history. 00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000 That's when I realized creativity wasn't in the sterile business jargon I'd prepared. 00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000 It was in the quiet moments that carried the weight of tradition and humanity. 00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000 My job wasn't to document businesses. 00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000 is to uncover the story simmering beneath them. 00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:11.000 This shift was my leap into creative journalism. As the only writer profiling Muslim-owned businesses in my rural town. 00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000 I thought professionalism meant being distant, detached, serious. 00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000 But I found artistry and connections. 00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000 Pairing a hijab boutiques and tricet designs with Quranic verses or narrating how an Afghan 00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000 what your balance islamic forming traditions with FDA regulations 00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:37.000 I found it in creating compelling narratives, presenting the information to contextualize your innovation, and crafting a timeline of their journeys. 00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000 Each interview became an opportunity to invent. 00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000 With every article, podcast episode, and film 00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000 I transformed oral stories into inspiration. 00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000 Creativity wasn't just about what I could say. 00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000 It was about what I could help others share. 00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000 I learned that questions like, how did you start rarely elicit answers as meaningful as 00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000 What does this mean to you? 00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000 When you ask about profit margins, you get numbers. When you ask about biryani, you get legacy. 00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000 folklift might create my creative platform. 00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000 is now poised to create 00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000 to grow beyond our local Muslim community. 00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000 Every neighborhood holds hidden gems, stories waiting to be discovered. 00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000 People ask me what makes my work unique, and I tell them about Ufrontes biryani. 00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000 For me, creativity isn't about being the loudest voice in the room. 00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000 It's about being the one who listens closely enough to hear the heartbeat of a story. 00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000 Yeah, I think it sounds really great. Great job. 00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000 All right. So for the rest of your UC application, do you have your activities and honors list 00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000 completed. 00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000 I've done all my extracurriculars, but my honors i need to add 00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000 Wait, let me just show you the section because I think there's like a couple things. 00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000 Um… 00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000 Okay, so I put some of them as volunteering. 00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000 Because I think the UCs prioritize like people who have more volunteering 00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000 opportunities and i think some of them fall under volunteering opportunities 00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000 So I put empowering AI in Synthoria and Filmmakers Club and JCamp 00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000 as extracurricular and then I put Sunday school as volunteering 00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000 And the forklift as extracurricular. 00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000 coated classy extracurricular. 00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000 Women in Games is volunteer 00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000 service and then podcast club as extracurricular 00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000 content creation as extracurricular. 00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000 MSG jobs is volunteer service. 00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000 And then I started adding the awards, but I think there's like a couple questions 00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000 Such as… 00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:03.000 eligibility requirements and what did you do what did he do to achieve this award or honor? 00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000 So maybe I think here if you could find information about how many people applied if it says 00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000 Or you can just tell them like about the organization say like Games for Change is a national organization and like here are like the um 00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000 the criterias for the award. 00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:32.000 Um. 00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000 Okay.

I just pasted those in. 00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000 I didn't add much for the other ones. 00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:51.000 Okay. 00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000 Let me look at this. 00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000 Have you done a little bit of research on this program and do you have a 00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000 pick some ideas of why this is 00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000 intriguing for you at MIT? 00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000 Yeah, so I think with this major, I think they have like a lot of courses 00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000 And both like media and interactive media in general 00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000 And so I think 00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000 Mm-hmm. 00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000 like the aspect of kind of 00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000 getting to do like film but also video game development and also 00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000 like technology like data science and stuff i think it's like almost everything that I like in one major so 00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000 Yeah, I think there's like a lot that I can write about, but I think specifically 00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000 this major has like a lot of opportunities with 00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000 like interactive media and interactive media 00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000 Kind of like the technological aspect to it. 00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000 Okay, great. This… 00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000 Perfect response here. 00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000 For the teaching essay, do you have a framework or a structure for it? 00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000 Already, or do you want to work on that right now? 00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000 I think, yeah, like a structure might be helpful 00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000 Okay, great. 00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:23.000 Let me write this down on your notes. 00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000 All right. So in terms of a structure for this essay, can you think of maybe like one, does any one moment stand out for you in terms of 00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:39.000 When you're able to convey something or teach something and it was just genuinely like very joyful and enjoyable for you 00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000 I mean, this isn't like extracurricular or anything but like 00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000 One specific instance is like 00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000 I have like a younger brother so 00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000 Naturally, I get to teach him a lot of things 00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000 And so I think 00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000 Like, I can't think of a specific instance but 00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:06.000 like um 00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000 Like, actually, I think… 00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000 like an interesting like kind of hook, which is kind of like not really extracurricular and I can start it off 00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000 could be like teaching my brother how to ride a bike 00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000 And then that's just like something that I do for fun and like 00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000 Yeah. 00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000 Maybe you can start off. Okay, so this is a short essay so 00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000 Oh. 00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000 If you can start off how like your first 00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000 experiences teaching were from your brother and then how you always had this like 00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:48.000 I don't know. I don't know like big sister energy if that's the right way to say it but like since then like you've because you're also a middle child so it's not exactly like you're like the oldest 00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000 one but in i guess in the context of that analogy saying how like 00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000 Through Teaching Your Brother, you've discovered this magic of like 00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000 conveying information to other people or like learning how to 00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000 I feel like teaching and storytelling are very 00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000 similar to so 00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000 maybe telling stories through teaching and that relates to your comparative media studies and 00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000 journalism and things so 00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000 saying how like teaching became your way to tell stories to the world 00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000 I feel like that's pretty cool. 00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Yeah. 00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000 And that way we can talk about in the JCamp essay, we can look at um 00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000 a different aspect of journalism like the impact it has rather than like the wonder of it 00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000 Because I think this shouldn't feel like 00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000 just an essay that's like describe one extracurricular that you're proud of that's 00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000 a different essay. So this should be something that's genuinely like very pleasurable 00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000 So yeah, teaching. 00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000 Yeah, I feel like teaching is your way 00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000 of telling stories to the world. That's pretty cool. So start off with like 00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:09.000 Teaching your younger brother how to bike. 00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000 And then from there, how you discovered 00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000 Your passion for teaching 00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:29.000 The question is, why is teaching pleasurable for you? 00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000 Oh, um… 00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000 I think just like 00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000 Like, okay, this is kind of hard to word but like 00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000 a little bit about like how… 00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000 Education can like kind of transformation 00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000 like how someone views the world 00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000 And like, I think that's… 00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000 And sometimes it's like a good thing and a bad thing. 00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000 but um 00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000 in myself teaching, I like to have to have like 00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000 I like to give like students kind of like 00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000 the space to 00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000 kind of interpret their own like 00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000 I guess have their own interpretations of what they're learning. 00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000 because like education can like if one person just educates one point of view then 00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000 it's like kind of forced on them but like i think the 00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000 best style of teaching is like kind of giving the opportunity to 00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000 have your own interpretation and kind of build others creativities 00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000 Yeah, definitely. 00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000 That sounds great. And then how are you going to connect this from the bike analogy? 00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000 Um… 00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000 I think like, okay, I think it could be like 00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000 at first with like my brother, I would like hold like hold his back and kind of guide him 00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000 um like to take his first few like pedals 00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000 But then by the time he kind of learns how to paddle properly, I just like let go and let him kind of 00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000 go on his own path, which is kind of metaphoric for like my teaching style which is to like 00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000 At first, you know, guide them, but then also give them like space for their own interpretation so maybe 00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000 that approach. 00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000 Yeah, that seems… 00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000 Good to me like 00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000 Basically, let them 00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000 letting them take… 00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000 the metaphorical handlebars off right 00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000 Yeah. 00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000 or training. I don't know what the best analogy is. And I think if you can, you can briefly 00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000 briefly name drop the other thing the other places you've taught. 00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000 So is this part over here like why teaching is pleasurable for me 00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000 And like, um. 00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000 And like that aspect like should i is it just like describing that and i don't have to like 00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000 related to anything that I've done. 00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000 Yeah, you just described it. 00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000 Okay. 00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000 Great. 00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000 And then I think… 00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000 like it's very short, so you're not going to have a lot of words 00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000 So yeah. 00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000 Let's just go to a question. Well, do you actually have any more questions about this essay or do you want to move on to the next? 00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000 No, I think I have a good idea for this one. 00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000 Okay. 00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000 And… 00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000 Okay. We're… 00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000 What is the… 00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000 What ways have you done something different than what was expected in your educational journey? So I think first we need to set up like 00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000 I think we can go for 00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000 Well, first you have to explain why it's 00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000 Why is this unexpected? 00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000 And then what you've done. 00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000 And then, so these are the two questions that you need to answer first before we even get into the framework. 00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000 So why is going into game development unexpected, in your opinion? 00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000 For one, it's like… 00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000 really interdisciplinary it's like 00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000 you have to do… 00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000 really technical aspects but at the same time 00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000 like really creative aspects as well. 00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000 And it's also kind of like 00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000 a lot of people don't see video games as like 00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000 Like… 00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000 kind of like a powerful tool for education or anything like people often just see it as like a time pass so 00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000 They don't really take the development of it seriously either. 00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000 I feel like that's not… 00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000 that unexpected. 00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000 Like you could say that for a lot of things. Like you could say like 00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000 Oh, people don't take English majors. 00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000 Seriously, but English is important and 00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000 And still people do it, but that's not like that unexpected. So I want to challenge you a little bit more to think about 00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:36.000 Some other reasons why video games might be unexpected here. 00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000 Wait, let me see if I could find any examples online. 00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000 Um… 00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Yeah, I want to see like what what they kind of mean by like 00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000 Like unexpected. 00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:23.000 All right. 00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000 Is this AC new? 00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000 No, I don't think so. I found like three 00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000 Examples. 00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:02.000 Okay. 00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000 Can you send me the example? 00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Yeah. 00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000 Yeah. 00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:23.000 Third is pretty similar. 00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000 Yeah, these are all the UC personal insight questions. 00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000 Oh yeah, it is. I switched it up and it's new for this cycle, so… 00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000 Yeah. 00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000 Okay, it's fine. 00:41:40.000 --> 00:42:10.000 Um. 00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000 One thing that you could write about if you wanted to would be like pursuing 00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000 journalism because you could say like 00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000 You can see like in the summer between junior year like you were thinking about spending your time doing a cs 00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000 boot camp like it's okay if you aren't, we're actually going to. We can say that you weren't, but instead you chose to do journalism and that's like 00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000 courageous in and of itself because you can say like they know i mean they know you're from the Bay Area like 00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000 Your dad was working in tech. Your mom was an engineer so like 00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000 it makes sense that everyone in the Bay Area wants to pursue tech, but I think like pursuing journalism 00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000 And you can find some statistics about like Muslim women representation in media. It's very little. 00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000 You can see like that is define the odds or expectations in some way 00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000 That could be something to write about. If you did that though, then we would change your JCamp essay probably to 00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000 something that is more related to gaming or CS. 00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000 Or in the context of game development. 00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000 What's unexpected about game development? 00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:22.000 I feel like we could also think of some reasons why that's different than what other people expect from you. 00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000 I think like to begin with, there's not a lot of like 00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000 Muslim women in gaming. 00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000 Yeah, that's true too. Yeah. 00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000 Yeah, so like, I think… 00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000 I think I kind of wrote about this in some of my previous common app drafts. 00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000 But it was just like about like how 00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000 Well, I don't think I have to bring up like specific instances but 00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000 Like, I'm just talking about like me being a gamer to begin with is like 00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000 kind of unexpected but um 00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000 Hmm. 00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000 turning it into like 00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000 a i guess a project is also like 00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000 I just like took it one step further, I guess. 00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000 Yeah. 00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000 Okay, how, so why is gaming unexpected? 00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000 Because I think like 00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000 a lot of Muslim women aren't 00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000 as like… 00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000 I guess I don't want to say inclined because that's like not really good reasoning but 00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000 There aren't many that play video games because for one it's like 00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000 It's really associated with violence and it's also 00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000 in a space where like 00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000 where there's less like Muslim women and it's like less comfortable to like 00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000 be in places where like you're not really represented. 00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000 Um… 00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000 Yeah, I think that's why it's kind of unexpected for me to play 00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000 Um… 00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000 Yeah. 00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000 Maybe you could say like, in normal settings your um 00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000 Don't try to say like don't portray this in a negative way but like you're like more shy you're quiet but like 00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:20.000 Once you put the headset on, it's like your confidence goes on like and then suddenly you're like saving worlds or you're like 00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000 Yeah. 00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000 building palaces or you're like doing something cool in the context of a video game. You can fill in the blank with whatever adventure you're working on and then 00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000 You can say like from the outside, like not many people would expect a Muslim girl to be like so passionate about gaming 00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:41.000 And then you can say that like you've taken that a step beyond and you're not just a player of games. You're like a creator of these worlds. And in the future, you want to create games that represent people like you. 00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000 In the context of like Synthoria and other projects you've worked on 00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000 And then you're also like a woman in games ambassador to diversify the gaming world, which is super important. 00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000 Yeah. I feel like that's good. What do you think about that? 00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000 Framing. 00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000 Yeah. 00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000 Yeah, I think that's definitely… 00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000 Okay. 00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000 Yeah, and I think like talking about the development part can bring in the academic, I mean, like the educational journey. 00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000 aspect. 00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:19.000 Yeah. 00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000 So essay framework can be like 00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000 Like, don't write this verbatim just like repurpose it in the context of an essay 00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000 Yeah. 00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000 From the outside, you appear shy, timid, introverted. 00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000 When you put the headset on. 00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000 You're saving the world. 00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000 So I see things. And then, um. 00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000 This is unexpected. 00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000 behavior for 00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000 Hey. 00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000 Muslim girl to be so passionate about gaming 00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000 But you've changed the gaming world by 00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000 Developing Synthoria. 00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000 And also being an ambassador 00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000 for women and games to make the field more diverse 00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000 What do you think? 00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000 Yeah. 00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000 Okay, I think it looks great. 00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000 When I talk about um like 00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000 Like a Muslim girls not really being like 00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000 A common appearance in video games. Should I talk about like like 00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000 kind of go into depth on like why or why 00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000 I can just like go 00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000 go into why you can just say it. If you want, you can give a statistic because you only have like 00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000 225 words, which is not a lot. 00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000 Yeah, okay, then that makes sense. 00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000 Okay, great. 00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000 Oh. 00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000 All right.

There was like 00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000 a higher class guy from like palo Alto like 00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000 Those just like I had to learn a lot about like 00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000 their background in order to understand like how 00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000 how like they kind of saw 00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000 the stories that we had to tell because we all had different like interpretations of like 00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000 the interviews that we're collecting and everything and then 00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000 In a way after that, like using all three of our like 00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000 feedback and like 00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000 our interpretations and we were able to 00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000 How do I create a 00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000 like a piece, like an 00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000 um about like the current state of like politics in austin 00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000 Great. And so where do you want to place the reader in? Where do you think you want to start this essay? 00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.000 Is there one conflict that you guys had due to your different backgrounds or like one area where you had to compromise 00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000 Yeah, I think like the first time meeting them 00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000 I could set the intro to kind of like the first time meeting them, which is like. 00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:55.000 we were all discussing like which ideas we wanted to do. For example, I wanted to talk about like 00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000 like the financial kind of like the financial kind 00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000 disparity in Austin. And then like one of them wanted to talk about um 00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000 like the racial 00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000 kind of like diversity in Austin. The other one to talk about 00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000 kind of like the… 00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000 political tension. And so we kind of combined it all into like one piece 00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000 And that's like how we collaborated. And then I think that could be like kind of like a first 00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000 sign of like collaboration 00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000 And then I could just kind of narrate like 00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000 the storytelling process during that 00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000 that the process of making that article 00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000 Um… 00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000 Okay, great. So is there like, do you want to start it off with a quote from this conversation or 00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000 How do you see this essay starting? 00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000 Oh. 00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000 Or you can maybe like an internal question like 00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000 Do we prioritize X or Y or like 00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000 Yeah. 00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000 Yeah, either like it could be, yeah, it could be like an internal question like that 00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000 Or I was thinking also 00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000 kind of showing like the juxtaposition of 00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000 like me in that setting. 00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000 Not just of me of like of like the three of us all like so different 00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000 In that setting. 00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:24.000 So I can kind of just contextualize like what this like argument kind of, it kind of led to 00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000 it was kind of like I had this underlying thing of like, oh, we're all so different 00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000 Um… 00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.000 And then after that, it can talk about like the argument that we were having about like, or not argument, but discussion about like 00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000 what our article should be about. 00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000 Okay. 00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.000 And then how were you guys able to come to a compromise? 00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000 Well, we had to like kind of 00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000 we kind of infuse like all of our kind of different interpretations into 00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000 like our um 00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000 our newspaper idea, I mean, like our article idea 00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000 So we kind of included 00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000 one segment of the article about 00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000 like racial tensions, one about socioeconomic tensions, one about political tensions. 00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000 So it was kind of like 00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000 a culmination of all three of our ideas. 00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000 Great. 00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:33.000 Okay. And then how did this ultimately translate into the context of the work that you produced? 00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000 And what did you… 00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000 Yeah, we… 00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:43.000 We ended up having like we ended up like um each having interviews done in like the street and like 00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000 We talk to different individuals in Austin and 00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000 And then like, I guess when writing it we got to 00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000 have like your own interpretations 00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000 and like describing like the interview and like 00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000 giving our own commentary in the article. 00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000 All right, great. 00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000 I think that that 00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000 Sounds good. I feel like you can just be straightforward in this article. I don't think it needs to be 00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000 too much more than that. 00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000 Okay. 00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000 Yeah. 00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000 And then for your final essay 00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000 How'd you manage a situation or challenge that you didn't expect? 00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:35.000 Um… 00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000 Okay, I think we made an edit that day 00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:49.000 Actually, no. 00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000 I think, yeah, I think we did that afternoon 00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000 Yeah. 00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000 Was it suddenly that afternoon or that afternoon? 00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000 It was just that afternoon, but… 00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000 I think let's keep the verbs. 00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:13.000 It's the same. 00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000 I think suddenly that afternoon sounds a little better. 00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000 Or maybe one afternoon, because I don't know if um 00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:52.000 It really makes sense. 00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:36.000 I feel like this feels a little cliche, this sentence 00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000 How did you come to realize the 00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000 importance of empathy. 00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000 I don't know if I emphasize enough but 00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000 It was kind of like seeing my sisters like 00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:54.000 lamp um like plunging her novel into darkness and my brother's nursery rhymes vanishing 00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000 like that was kind of like my driving factor to like 00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000 like, oh, this is impacting other people so i i could do like the least like the least I could do is just like um 00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000 kind of help out. And so I guess that 00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000 kind of the part I was trying to emphasize, but I don't know if that's clear 00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:38.000 I feel like this paragraph feels a little bit disjointed. 00:56:38.000 --> 00:57:08.000 When you use the essays to see how you… 00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:44.000 we can just shorten this for this one. 00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000 I don't know if it's asking for like 00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000 Like what I did later to like 00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000 Like, I don't know if I should use that one 00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000 The prompt is just asking about like a challenge and like what I learned from it 00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000 So I don't know if it's asking about like 00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000 other projects that I did in the future. 00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000 That's… 00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000 True. 00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000 Or I guess it says like, what did you learn from it? So maybe that's like a part of learning from 00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:23.000 It can be like a broad interpretation yeah 00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000 But I do like the importance of empathy and i also think 00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000 Agency also comes in here. 00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000 like the um 00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:43.000 that you too can make a change. 00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:53.000 Okay. 00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000 I just feel like this feels a bit forced right now. 00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000 Yeah. 00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.000 Um… 00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000 I agree. 00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000 I can like, I can add extra kind of extra 00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000 like in internal like internal 00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000 monologue about like how 00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000 like seeing them 00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000 like like seeing their 00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:32.000 like instead of telling people that like it taught me empathy i can like kind of talk about like how like seeing like my siblings 00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000 Like, um. 00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000 I don't know how to describe it but like 00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:43.000 their tools being like disabled and everything um i think like that was the thing that brought me urgency 00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000 So kind of like a little bit like selflessness but then 00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000 Again, there's also the thing of like the fortnight victory real but 00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000 Um… 00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000 Yeah, so maybe like illustrating that it was like my siblings distress that kind of 01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000 determined me. 01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000 Yeah, I think it's clear here that like 01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000 But I feel like I've come to realize the importance of empathy 01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000 Um. 01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.000 It kind of feels hollow here. 01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.000 Is there another lesson that you feel like you learned through this situation or through this context? 01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000 maybe that like, because oftentimes 01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000 Well, I don't know if this is shown in this context, but like 01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000 Oftentimes like $20 are just kind of like overlooked, like, oh, it's just 20 20 01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000 But then that kind of made me realize that like 01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000 Like, yes, I can make a change. Like you said agency 01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000 And it showed like because when I was younger, I didn't really think like 01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000 I could support my family financially and so like 01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000 I think that kind of just… 01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000 inspired me that like, yes, I can make a change 01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000 Maybe. 01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000 Yeah, that, um. 01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000 And also maybe you could talk about like 01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000 Empathy in the sense that it's like, yeah, making small sacrifices 01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000 for the greater good. 01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000 responsibility for other people. 01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000 And then I think you can emphasize, I'm writing this down in a comment. I think you can emphasize 01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:37.000 how this responsibility extends to other areas of your life too. 01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:45.000 For example, like building code that takes into account diverse populations or ensuring that minority groups are represented in your journalism. 01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000 And like. 01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000 extrapolating this more? 01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000 Yeah. 01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000 Yeah. 01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000 What do you think? 01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000 Yeah, I think that's… 01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000 That looks great. 01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000 Okay, sounds good. 01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000 Um… 01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000 And then is there anything else that you 01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000 I feel like is missing from this essay. 01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000 I think… 01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000 I think I can fix it after I implement these changes because I think this last paragraph is 01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000 most of like the like the main point of it 01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000 So I think like once I change it, I might… 01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000 be able to fix it better. 01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000 Great.

How are you? 00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000 Good. Do you have this whole week off for break? 00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000 Yeah. 00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000 Oh, that's so nice. I do too. So I'm home in Portland. It's been pretty nice. 00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000 Well, it's good to see you. How have you been spending your break? How was your first day 00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000 So far, just… 00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000 working, I guess. I've been working 00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000 um on like the UC draft, because I don't know if that's just taking me a really long time because I can't 00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000 really indecisive about like my wording 00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000 And then like, I guess I kind of started a little bit of the mit 00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000 supplementals, but I guess it's just been kind of productive so yeah 00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000 Awesome. Well… 00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000 I mean, I think it's good to like have a break, but also I'm glad that, you know, you're still keeping up with everything. 00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000 So let me just. 00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Open up your UC document. 00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000 Is it just that one essay that you're still working on? 00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000 Yeah. Okay. 00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000 Let me go on the document. So I have 00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000 three kind of like different wording like this first one is just like, I just wrote like a different hook 00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000 And then these two are just like the same thing, but they're like worded a little differently. 00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000 Okay. 00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:08.000 Give me a second to read over these. 00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000 Okay. 00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000 Which one is your f",
    "avorite so far? 00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000 I like this last one. 00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000 Okay, and why is that your favorite? 00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000 I feel like it's a little more like 00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000 kind of… 00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000 focusing more on my creativity i think 00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000 Mm-hmm. 00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000 And I think it's also a little more like it's a little less wordy and like 00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000 I feel like the other one's kind of verbose it's just like 00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000 packing a lot into one essay. 00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000 I love this first description. I think it's so engaging. 00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000 I also like this one the best too. 00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000 Great. 00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000 So… 00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000 I think the biggest thing is just emphasizing creativity throughout the story. So let me just read the rest of this. 00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000 Is there another way you can say this sentence instead of being so straightforward here? 00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000 Um… 00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000 Like, should I mention like journalism like explicitly and then maybe not saying like creative um journalism but 00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000 Should I mention journalism in this sentence? 00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000 Actually, I feel like in context it seems… 00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000 Fine. 00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:47.000 Okay. 00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:59.000 This is great. 00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000 I love this last sentence. 00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000 Thank you. 00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000 But it seems like you're writing more about paying attention than creativity. 00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000 So can you tell me specifically what makes this creative? 00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000 I think like I only really 00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000 Like, I think that's kind of my problem is that um i kind of address it but not comple",
    "tely 00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:42.000 And this one part where I talk about like pairing the hijabs boutique intricate designs with chronic purses or like talking about like the Afghan butcher who has to balance Islamic farming traditions and FDA regulations 00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000 I was kind of going for like 00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000 Shouldn't a juxtaposition, not juxtaposition but like 00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000 creating these stories so that they have like the context 00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000 and like um so like readers who aren't familiar with their background and like don't have these experiences so that they're able to understand 00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000 So kind of creating like creating 00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000 um like narrations that are accessible to everyone because these are like stories that need to be heard. 00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000 And like, how does that involve your own decision making or your own creativity? 00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000 It's like when I'm narrating it and like when I'm writing the story 00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000 And like, I guess the decisions also lie in like the questions that you ask 00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000 it's because like you need to make sure there's questions that can give like the readers a better understanding of like 00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000 like what made this person start their businesses and like what advice they have for like entrepreneurs and like 00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000 Kind of… 00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000 Framing. I think like framing is like my creative aspect of it 00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000 it's like… 00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000 making sure that it's like the right information is presented, I think. 00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:09.000 Okay, let me read over this one more time. 00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000 I'm just going to make sure all the verb tenses are the same. 00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000 Because… 00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000 here it's like, I think p",

    "kind of 00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000 getting to do like film but also video game development and also 00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000 like technology like data science and stuff i think it's like almost everything that I like in one major so 00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000 Yeah, I think there's like a lot that I can write about, but I think specifically 00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000 this major has like a lot of opportunities with 00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000 like interactive media and interactive media 00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000 Kind of like the technological aspect to it. 00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000 Okay, great. This… 00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000 Perfect response here. 00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000 For the teaching essay, do you have a framework or a structure for it? 00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000 Already, or do you want to work on that right now? 00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000 I think, yeah, like a structure might be helpful 00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000 Okay, great. 00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:23.000 Let me write this down on your notes. 00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000 All right. So in terms of a structure for this essay, can you think of maybe like one, does any one moment stand out for you in terms of 00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:39.000 When you're able to convey something or teach something and it was just genuinely like very joyful and enjoyable for you 00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000 I mean, this isn't like extracurricular or anything but like 00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000 One specific instance is like 00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000 I have like a younger brother so 00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000 Naturally, I get to teach him a lot of things 00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000 And so I think 00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000 Like, I can't think of a specific instance but 00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:06.000 like um 00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000 Like, actually, I think… 00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000 like an interesting like kind of hook, which is kind of like not really extracurricular and ",
    "I can start it off 00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000 could be like teaching my brother how to ride a bike 00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000 And then that's just like something that I do for fun and like 00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000 Yeah. 00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000 Maybe you can start off. Okay, so this is a short essay so 00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000 Oh. 00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000 If you can start off how like your first 00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000 experiences teaching were from your brother and then how you always had this like 00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:48.000 I don't know. I don't know like big sister energy if that's the right way to say it but like since then like you've because you're also a middle child so it's not exactly like you're like the oldest 00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000 one but in i guess in the context of that analogy saying how like 00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000 Through Teaching Your Brother, you've discovered this magic of like 00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000 conveying information to other people or like learning how to 00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000 I feel like teaching and storytelling are very 00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000 similar to so 00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000 maybe telling stories through teaching and that relates to your comparative media studies and 00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000 journalism and things so 00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000 saying how like teaching became your way to tell stories to the world 00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000 I feel like that's pretty cool. 00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Yeah. 00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000 And that way we can talk about in the JCamp essay, we can look at um 00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000 a different aspect of journalism like the impact it has rather than like the wonder of it 00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000 Because I think this shouldn't feel like 00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000 just an essay that's like describe one extracurricular that you're proud of that's 00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000 a different essay",
    ". So this should be something that's genuinely like very pleasurable 00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000 So yeah, teaching. 00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000 Yeah, I feel like teaching is your way 00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000 of telling stories to the world. That's pretty cool. So start off with like 00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:09.000 Teaching your younger brother how to bike. 00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000 And then from there, how you discovered 00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000 Your passion for teaching 00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:29.000 The question is, why is teaching pleasurable for you? 00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000 Oh, um… 00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000 I think just like 00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000 Like, okay, this is kind of hard to word but like 00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000 a little bit about like how… 00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000 Education can like kind of transformation 00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000 like how someone views the world 00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000 And like, I think that's… 00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000 And sometimes it's like a good thing and a bad thing. 00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000 but um 00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000 in myself teaching, I like to have to have like 00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000 I like to give like students kind of like 00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000 the space to 00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000 kind of interpret their own like 00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000 I guess have their own interpretations of what they're learning. 00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000 because like education can like if one person just educates one point of view then 00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000 it's like kind of forced on them but like i think the 00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000 best style of teaching is like kind of giving the opportunity to 00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000 have your own interpretation and kind of build others creativities 00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000 Yeah, definitely. 00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000 That sounds great. And then how are you going to connect this from th",
    "e bike analogy? 00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000 Um… 00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000 I think like, okay, I think it could be like 00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000 at first with like my brother, I would like hold like hold his back and kind of guide him 00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000 um like to take his first few like pedals 00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000 But then by the time he kind of learns how to paddle properly, I just like let go and let him kind of 00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000 go on his own path, which is kind of metaphoric for like my teaching style which is to like 00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000 At first, you know, guide them, but then also give them like space for their own interpretation so maybe 00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000 that approach. 00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000 Yeah, that seems… 00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000 Good to me like 00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000 Basically, let them 00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000 letting them take… 00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000 the metaphorical handlebars off right 00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000 Yeah. 00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000 or training. I don't know what the best analogy is. And I think if you can, you can briefly 00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000 briefly name drop the other thing the other places you've taught. 00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000 So is this part over here like why teaching is pleasurable for me 00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000 And like, um. 00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000 And like that aspect like should i is it just like describing that and i don't have to like 00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000 related to anything that I've done. 00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000 Yeah, you just described it. 00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000 Okay. 00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000 Great. 00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000 And then I think… 00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000 like it's very short, so you're not going to have a lot of words 00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000 So yeah. 00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000 Let's just go to a question. Well, do you actually have any mo",
    "re questions about this essay or do you want to move on to the next? 00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000 No, I think I have a good idea for this one. 00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000 Okay. 00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000 And… 00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000 Okay. We're… 00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000 What is the… 00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000 What ways have you done something different than what was expected in your educational journey? So I think first we need to set up like 00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000 I think we can go for 00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000 Well, first you have to explain why it's 00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000 Why is this unexpected? 00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000 And then what you've done. 00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000 And then, so these are the two questions that you need to answer first before we even get into the framework. 00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000 So why is going into game development unexpected, in your opinion? 00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000 For one, it's like… 00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000 really interdisciplinary it's like 00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000 you have to do… 00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000 really technical aspects but at the same time 00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000 like really creative aspects as well. 00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000 And it's also kind of like 00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000 a lot of people don't see video games as like 00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000 Like… 00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000 kind of like a powerful tool for education or anything like people often just see it as like a time pass so 00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000 They don't really take the development of it seriously either. 00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000 I feel like that's not… 00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000 that unexpected. 00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000 Like you could say that for a lot of things. Like you could say like 00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000 Oh, people don't take English majors. 00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000 Seriously, but English is important and 00:37:59.000 --> 00",
    ":38:06.000 And still people do it, but that's not like that unexpected. So I want to challenge you a little bit more to think about 00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:36.000 Some other reasons why video games might be unexpected here. 00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000 Wait, let me see if I could find any examples online. 00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000 Um… 00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Yeah, I want to see like what what they kind of mean by like 00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000 Like unexpected. 00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:23.000 All right. 00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000 Is this AC new? 00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000 No, I don't think so. I found like three 00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000 Examples. 00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:02.000 Okay. 00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000 Can you send me the example? 00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Yeah. 00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000 Yeah. 00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:23.000 Third is pretty similar. 00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000 Yeah, these are all the UC personal insight questions. 00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000 Oh yeah, it is. I switched it up and it's new for this cycle, so… 00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000 Yeah. 00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000 Okay, it's fine. 00:41:40.000 --> 00:42:10.000 Um. 00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000 One thing that you could write about if you wanted to would be like pursuing 00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000 journalism because you could say like 00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000 You can see like in the summer between junior year like you were thinking about spending your time doing a cs 00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000 boot camp like it's okay if you aren't, we're actually going to. We can say that you weren't, but instead you chose to do journalism and that's like 00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000 courageous in and of itself because you can say like they know i mean they know you're from the Bay Area like 00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000 Your dad was working in tech. Your mom was an engineer so like 00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000 it makes sense that everyone in the Bay Area w",
    "ants to pursue tech, but I think like pursuing journalism 00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000 And you can find some statistics about like Muslim women representation in media. It's very little. 00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000 You can see like that is define the odds or expectations in some way 00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000 That could be something to write about. If you did that though, then we would change your JCamp essay probably to 00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000 something that is more related to gaming or CS. 00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000 Or in the context of game development. 00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000 What's unexpected about game development? 00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:22.000 I feel like we could also think of some reasons why that's different than what other people expect from you. 00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000 I think like to begin with, there's not a lot of like 00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000 Muslim women in gaming. 00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000 Yeah, that's true too. Yeah. 00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000 Yeah, so like, I think… 00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000 I think I kind of wrote about this in some of my previous common app drafts. 00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000 But it was just like about like how 00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000 Well, I don't think I have to bring up like specific instances but 00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000 Like, I'm just talking about like me being a gamer to begin with is like 00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000 kind of unexpected but um 00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000 Hmm. 00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000 turning it into like 00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000 a i guess a project is also like 00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000 I just like took it one step further, I guess. 00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000 Yeah. 00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000 Okay, how, so why is gaming unexpected? 00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000 Because I think like 00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000 a lot of Muslim women aren't 00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000 as like… 00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000 I guess I don't want",
    " to say inclined because that's like not really good reasoning but 00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000 There aren't many that play video games because for one it's like 00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000 It's really associated with violence and it's also 00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000 in a space where like 00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000 where there's less like Muslim women and it's like less comfortable to like 00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000 be in places where like you're not really represented. 00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000 Um… 00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000 Yeah, I think that's why it's kind of unexpected for me to play 00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000 Um… 00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000 Yeah. 00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000 Maybe you could say like, in normal settings your um 00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000 Don't try to say like don't portray this in a negative way but like you're like more shy you're quiet but like 00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:20.000 Once you put the headset on, it's like your confidence goes on like and then suddenly you're like saving worlds or you're like 00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000 Yeah. 00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000 building palaces or you're like doing something cool in the context of a video game.

    "stin 00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000 Great. And so where do you want to place the reader in? Where do you think you want to start this essay? 00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.000 Is there one conflict that you guys had due to your different backgrounds or like one area where you had to compromise 00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000 Yeah, I think like the first time meeting them 00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000 I could set the intro to kind of like the first time meeting them, which is like. 00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:55.000 we were all discussing like which ideas we wanted to do. For example, I wanted to talk about like 00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000 like the financial kind of like the financial kind 00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000 disparity in Austin. And then like one of them wanted to talk about um 00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000 like the racial 00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000 kind of like diversity in Austin. The other one to talk about 00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000 kind of like the… 00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000 political tension. And so we kind of combined it all into like one piece 00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000 And that's like how we collaborated. And then I think that could be like kind of like a first 00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000 sign of like collaboration 00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000 And then I could just kind of narrate like 00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000 the storytelling process during that 00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000 that the process of making that article 00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000 Um… 00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000 Okay, great.

    "l question like that 00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000 Or I was thinking also 00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000 kind of showing like the juxtaposition of 00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000 like me in that setting. 00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000 Not just of me of like of like the three of us all like so different 00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000 In that setting. 00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:24.000 So I can kind of just contextualize like what this like argument kind of, it kind of led to 00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000 it was kind of like I had this underlying thing of like, oh, we're all so different 00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000 Um… 00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.000 And then after that, it can talk about like the argument that we were having about like, or not argument, but discussion about like 00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000 what our article should be about. 00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000 Okay. 00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.000 And then how were you guys able to come to a compromise? 00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000 Well, we had to like kind of 00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000 we kind of infuse like all of our kind of different interpretations into 00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000 like our um 00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000 our newspaper idea, I mean, like our article idea 00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000 So we kind of included 00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000 one segment of the article about 00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000 like racial tensions, one about socioeconomic tensions, one about political tensions. 00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000 So it was kind of like 00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000 a culmination of all three of our ideas. 00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000 Great. 00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:33.000 Okay. And then how did this ultimately translate into the context of the work that you produced? 00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000 And what did you… 00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000 Yeah, we… 00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:43.000 We ended up having like we ended up like um each having interviews done in like the street and like 00:52:43.000",
    " --> 00:52:48.000 We talk to different individuals in Austin and 00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000 And then like, I guess when writing it we got to 00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000 have like your own interpretations 00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000 and like describing like the interview and like 00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000 giving our own commentary in the article. 00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000 All right, great. 00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000 I think that that 00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000 Sounds good. I feel like you can just be straightforward in this article. I don't think it needs to be 00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000 too much more than that. 00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000 Okay. 00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000 Yeah. 00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000 And then for your final essay 00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000 How'd you manage a situation or challenge that you didn't expect? 00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:35.000 Um… 00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000 Okay, I think we made an edit that day 00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:49.000 Actually, no. 00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000 I think, yeah, I think we did that afternoon 00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000 Yeah. 00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000 Was it suddenly that afternoon or that afternoon? 00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000 It was just that afternoon, but… 00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000 I think let's keep the verbs. 00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:13.000 It's the same. 00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000 I think suddenly that afternoon sounds a little better. 00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000 Or maybe one afternoon, because I don't know if um 00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:52.000 It really makes sense. 00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:36.000 I feel like this feels a little cliche, this sentence 00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000 How did you come to realize the 00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000 importance of empathy. 00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000 I don't know if I emphasize enough but 00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000 It was kind of like seeing my sisters like 00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:54.000 lamp um like plunging her novel ",

I think you can emphasize 01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:37.000 how this responsibility extends to other areas of your life too. 01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:45.000 For example, like building code that takes into account diverse populations or ensuring that minority groups are represented in your journalism. 01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000 And like. 01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000 extrapolating this more? 01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000 Yeah. 01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000 Yeah. 01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000 What do you think? 01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000 Yeah, I think that's… 01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000 That looks great. 01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000 Okay, sounds good. 01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000 Um… 01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000 And then is there anything else that you 01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000 I feel like is missing from this essay. 01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000 I think… 01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000 I think I can fix it after I implement these changes because I think this last paragraph is 01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000 most of like the like the main point of it 01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000 So I think like once I change it, I might… 01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000 be able to fix it better. 01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000 Great. Sounds perfect. 01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:40.000 Okay, so when do you want to meet again? And I think after this, we have to talk about your UPenn essays during our next meeting and then also review",
    " these. 01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000 Um… 01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000 Like… 01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000 Tuesday or Wednesday i mean like 01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000 tomorrow's Tuesday, so I don't know about your availability 01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000 Or like if I'll get anything done, but… 01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000 you know like wednesday maybe 01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000 Wednesday would be good. Yeah, what time is best for you? 01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000 I'm available anytime. So whenever it's like 01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000 Best for you. 01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000 Could you like 4.30 to 5.30? Does that work? 01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000 Actually. 01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000 Or we could do like… 01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000 Wednesday. 01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000 Yeah, I think… 01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000 In the evening. Pretty flexible. 01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000 Yeah, I think actually the evening's better 01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000 Okay, let's just do this time then, 8 to 9. Is that okay? 01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000 Yeah. 01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:33.000 Okay, I feel like you've made really good progress. Let me know when you submit your MIT, not MIT, UC application. 01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000 Yeah. 01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000 Okay, sounds good. 01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000 See you on Wednesday.
