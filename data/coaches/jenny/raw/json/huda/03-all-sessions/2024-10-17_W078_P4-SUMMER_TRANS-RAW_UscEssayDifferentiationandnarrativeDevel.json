How are you? 2 00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.110 huda: Hi! I'm doing well. How are you. 3 00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm doing good as well, too. Good to see you. How's your week been? What have you been up to? 4 00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:39.290 huda: It's been pretty great. I had a statistics test, and I think I did pretty well on that 5 00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.729 huda: and I mean, like, there's not really many updates. But yeah. 6 00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.459 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, that sounds good. I'm glad that it's been like pretty chill. 7 00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:54.081 Jenny Duan: I think that maybe we can just get started. 8 00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.499 Jenny Duan: we can start by finalizing the Uscses. Is that okay? With you? 9 00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.489 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me open those right now. 10 00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.220 Jenny Duan: Okay. 11 00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.529 Jenny Duan: on the document. 12 00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.270 Jenny Duan: I want to finish looking at your short answers first.st 13 00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:26.570 huda: Yeah, actually, I reworded some of them, and I came up with alternatives for some of them. Like, for example, the one the one about 14 00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.790 huda: that. Yeah. 15 00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.260 huda: I can look at a little funnier version, but I don't know if it's doing professional. 16 00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.180 Jenny Duan: Hmm 17 00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.420 Jenny Duan: is kisses the right word here. 18 00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.139 Jenny Duan: cause I don't know if, like camera kisses the huggy. Sophia is the right. 19 00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.809 huda: Yeah, I mean, I think it could be worded differently. 20 00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.259 Jenny Duan: There another word you can think of in this. 21 00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.299 huda: I think it'd just be like meets the West, and my camera meets the huggy Huggia, Sophia. 22 00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.699 huda: I don't know if this is like correct, but it could also be like the East frames the West. 23 00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.429 Jenny Duan: I wouldn't say that. Maybe let me 24 00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.850 Jenny Duan: is meets 25 00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.830 Jenny Duan: meets. Maybe 26 00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.133 Jenny Duan: meats might be good. What's another thing meets, and 27 00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.170 Jenny Duan: interesting. 28 00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.660 huda: Crosses. 29 00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.290 Jenny Duan: Like, maybe something you could do is 30 00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.320 Jenny Duan: like you could have 2 words that are different words, but like similar sounds. 31 00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:23.270 Jenny Duan: So, for example, like like kisses and crosses, you know, like those kind of sound the same, but they're not the same word. So if you find 2 like, maybe not those exact words, but if you find 2 words that are pretty similar within sound, you could use those 2 instead. 32 00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.459 huda: any captures, crosses and captures. 33 00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 34 00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.180 Jenny Duan: okay, we have a like 4 characters to to cut here. 35 00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:38.010 huda: Maybe you could just like the plus could be 36 00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.410 huda: fine, and then, like no period, maybe. 37 00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.190 huda: let me see how it looks. 38 00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.459 huda: That's 1 on one. 39 00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.490 huda: maybe, where the east and west cross in my camera. 40 00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.649 huda: And the yeah. But I feel like that breaks up like the 41 00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.310 huda: like the thing where it says, like my camera captures the huggy, Sophia. 42 00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.840 huda: Maybe like we don't need the 43 00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.320 huda: or maybe like even like the peer at the end, might do something. 44 00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.290 Jenny Duan: I think that, though is necessary. 45 00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.900 huda: Hmm. 46 00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.670 Jenny Duan: That's fine. If you want to change daily 47 00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.060 Jenny Duan: instead of of course you could change it to daily, but I don't know if that captures. What you're trying to say. 48 00:08:54.107 --> 00:08:56.469 huda: I think. Yeah, daily works as well. 49 00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.979 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do that. 50 00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.830 huda: We actually, instead of this, can I? Can I do? And then like another 51 00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.929 huda: like that. 52 00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.750 Jenny Duan: That works, too. 53 00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah, sounds good. 54 00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.680 Jenny Duan: Oh. 55 00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.270 Jenny Duan: okay. Tell me about these these 3 different drafts that you put under here. 56 00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.459 huda: Yeah. So I actually like. 57 00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:54.219 huda: I read back like, I kind of like, read like the cover of like under the time entry. And I realized that it's about like I guess, like 58 00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:18.643 huda: there's like these flashbacks of like this woman who's like during the partition. And then she's like telling the story to someone like in modern day. And so like, I realize that it's like a lot similar to like when my grandma tells me stories. So that's kind of like where the second one is about, and also like a large, like a central part of what the story is about like realizing where your roots are from, and like 59 00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:37.089 huda: and like the kind of the growth away from like traumatic pasts, I guess, and so like these 3 options are kind of like. They're kind of alluding to that, but in different ways, like the 1st one is more of like like a 1 sentence, kind of like explaining what like the whole moral of the story is. 60 00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:52.067 huda: and then, I guess, like the same with the 3rd one, and then the second one is more about like my personal like, how I feel about it and like because it reminds me of like when my grandma used to tell me stories, and also like 61 00:10:52.570 --> 00:11:03.839 huda: and also like the storytelling aspect. Because I think what's interesting about the book is it's also about like storytelling. And I'm a storyteller. So I think that's like also one thing that I took away from the book as well. 62 00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.189 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let me see. 63 00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.170 Jenny Duan: let me look at some examples to see what worked. 64 00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.651 Jenny Duan: Wait. I saw that online. 65 00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.960 Jenny Duan: people just answer. So if you want to. You could just answer without writing anything. 66 00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.319 huda: Honestly, yeah, I think that might be better. 67 00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 68 00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.369 huda: In that case, like if I 69 00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.050 huda: I might either go with the 1st one, or just like 70 00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.859 huda: just like the name of the book. 71 00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.059 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe 72 00:12:15.024 --> 00:12:20.200 Jenny Duan: I don't know. I think either are fine. I don't think you need to write something extremely 73 00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.549 Jenny Duan: in depth detail. 74 00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.580 huda: Okay, then I'll 75 00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.420 huda: I don't know what's that? 76 00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:48.479 huda: Maybe like, I feel like I can add this bit because it might show like a little bit about like how I think when I'm reading books, maybe. 77 00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.440 Jenny Duan: let me look at this guide. 78 00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.470 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 79 00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.889 Jenny Duan: Which one do you think you're gonna go with this one. 80 00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.990 huda: Yeah, I think so. 81 00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.679 Jenny Duan: Go ahead. 82 00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.160 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could teach on the class on any topic. 83 00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.350 Jenny Duan: Oh, these are bad! 84 00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.050 Jenny Duan: Which one which one like feels more resonant with you. I think they're both good. 85 00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.190 huda: I feel like 86 00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.169 huda: the second one is a little more like. 87 00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:12.159 huda: I think, like I like the the beginning parts of liberation or label, because that's like also another trope labeling. So I think it addresses both things. So I think that would be more like interesting to teach. 88 00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.139 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. Let's go with that one. 89 00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:26.900 Jenny Duan: Okay, now, I want to start with this, too. So, okay, sorry. Do you feel comfortable with all of these short answer questions. 90 00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.840 huda: Yeah. 91 00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:34.970 Jenny Duan: Great. Yay. Okay, let's go to the 1st essay, which is, describe how you plan to pursue your academic interests. 92 00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.472 Jenny Duan: So actually, something that I noticed is 93 00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.910 Jenny Duan: like a lot of these are 94 00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.880 Jenny Duan: about gaming. I feel like it's not. It doesn't really show that 95 00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.120 Jenny Duan: enough of your character, because I think all your essays are about games. 96 00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.850 Jenny Duan: Obviously, this is this makes sense. Why, that's about games. 97 00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.389 Jenny Duan: This one. 98 00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.389 Jenny Duan: Okay, this one is not all about games. This one's fine. 99 00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:12.800 Jenny Duan: I'm assuming you're going with this essay compared to the second essay, the growing up in a rural town where resources were scarce one. 100 00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.819 huda: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm I think I'm still working out the draft of the 1st one. But yeah. 101 00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.110 Jenny Duan: And then, okay. 102 00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.850 Jenny Duan: okay, I think, okay. Then, I think your essays are are okay. But I think 103 00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.010 Jenny Duan: we need to just make sure that they're unique enough so that they don't repeat the same themes over and over. 104 00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:39.269 huda: Yeah, this last one. It was like, you have to pick something that like one of the themes that stood out most. And then one of them was about like 105 00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:42.239 huda: like person 106 00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.050 huda: personalized like education. 107 00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.420 huda: So. 108 00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.930 huda: yeah. 109 00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.055 Jenny Duan: Okay, 110 00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.842 Jenny Duan: let's just start with this 1st one. 111 00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.349 Jenny Duan: this sentence, I think we can show. Instead of telling. 112 00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.190 Jenny Duan: So this one's like, you emphasize games for teaching. 113 00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:37.310 Jenny Duan: This is pretty similar to the other. Like essay number 3. 114 00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.530 Jenny Duan: Great. 115 00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.470 Jenny Duan: I love this. This is great. 116 00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:53.900 Jenny Duan: Thanks. 117 00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.020 Jenny Duan: Does Usc emphasize interdisciplinary learning a lot. 118 00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:32.389 huda: Yeah. Actually, when we went to tour there, that was like it was iterated so many times like, it's like every major, every built one time we went to like a building. They're like, Oh, like, if you're a computer science major, you can even do like like something in the school of cinematic arts like they're really focused on like how there's no like one set like classes that you have to take. And you could take any, and it's like it's a really big deal on Usc. I think. 119 00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.210 Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah. 120 00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.500 Jenny Duan: great. 121 00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.040 Jenny Duan: Okay. 122 00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.519 Jenny Duan: I think that this. 123 00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.719 Jenny Duan: it's this is good, like, here is good 124 00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.509 Jenny Duan: But let me do some research 125 00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.129 Jenny Duan: on this, major. 126 00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.559 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't think you need the 127 00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.929 Jenny Duan: parentheses here. I think you can just say computer science games. 128 00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.390 huda: Okay. 129 00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.580 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 130 00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:02.590 Jenny Duan: So you say, storytelling twice, here. Is there another way you can reword this. 131 00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.489 huda: like, maybe 132 00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.490 huda: exploring narratives. 133 00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.490 huda: Yeah. 134 00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.570 Jenny Duan: Be good. 135 00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:35.950 Jenny Duan: Great! 136 00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:49.639 Jenny Duan: I wonder if you can write a different intro that doesn't mention centuria, and maybe something else about like building with Cs instead. 137 00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.780 huda: Hmm 138 00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.699 Jenny Duan: Let's come back to this. 139 00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.120 Jenny Duan: I want to come back to this beginning after we look at some of your other essays. 140 00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:07.730 Jenny Duan: just so we can see, like how to make this more unique. I think the bottom this is all good. I think it's just these 2 paragraphs that might need to be changed. 141 00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.510 Jenny Duan: What are your thoughts on this. 142 00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:19.149 huda: Yeah, I think, like, I think, like, all the issues are like, somehow a little similar. So it's like difficult to talk about anything, because I mean, like, I want to emphasize like 143 00:20:19.492 --> 00:20:27.919 huda: like a game developer, I think, because, like, that's like the major 1st choice, major that I'm applying for. But I think there are definitely ways like. 144 00:20:28.338 --> 00:20:43.849 huda: maybe that could be through like the women in games, ambassadorship, or like the games for change, podcast I mean the games podcast games for change award. So maybe I could use those instead of like cynthoria. 145 00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like that would be good. 146 00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.609 Jenny Duan: Let's look at some of your other essays first, st though. 147 00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.300 Jenny Duan: hmm. 148 00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.889 huda: Actually, I'm not done with this part yet, because I need to add a conclusion to it. But 149 00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.330 Jenny Duan: Wait. Do you want to review this, or do you want to just come back to it another time? 150 00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:15.420 huda: I think if we can review what I have so far and like, maybe you can tell me what I. 151 00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.489 Jenny Duan: I think this is 40.th 152 00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.480 Jenny Duan: Let's elaborate what rural town means. 153 00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.870 Jenny Duan: I think you can do a little bit more showing here, like, what does the what is a rural town? 154 00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.300 Jenny Duan: Not sure if secluded is the right word here. 155 00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.770 huda: I'm not like like 156 00:22:44.251 --> 00:22:46.509 huda: I don't know how else to describe it, like 157 00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:58.680 huda: away from opportunities, and like kind of far away from other places, which is like why it leads like other people, or, like everyone in the town, wants to like, do something to innovate and like, do something with technology. 158 00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:00.540 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 159 00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.440 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 160 00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.209 Jenny Duan: I love this framework. 161 00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.050 Jenny Duan: and I think it translates well into this. 162 00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.400 Jenny Duan: So I think that, like 163 00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.699 Jenny Duan: what we can do is 164 00:23:49.370 --> 00:24:04.819 Jenny Duan: I. I think just this word secluded might be changed, because I feel like secluded is maybe not the right word, because I think Mountain House is still like, surrounded by other cities. But so it's not necessarily secluded. But maybe there's a different word we can 165 00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.180 Jenny Duan: use here. 166 00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.680 Jenny Duan: maybe like just rural, because now you just describe what rural means. So 167 00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.490 Jenny Duan: it's fine for now 168 00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.190 Jenny Duan: I think this 169 00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.469 Jenny Duan: we're this is a little bit wordy here. 170 00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.990 Jenny Duan: I think here you can. 171 00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:35.270 Jenny Duan: You can maybe talk about how like there wasn't much to do or like you. You were bored or like you couldn't find other activities. So you turned to like computer science. 172 00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.110 huda: okay, cool. 173 00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.468 Jenny Duan: I think this setting is a little bit 174 00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:17.720 Jenny Duan: it feels a little bit out of place. Because why are you dashing like? Why are you at the Park? In the 1st place, I think you're kind of plopping the reader into a scene where they don't have very much context. 175 00:25:20.727 --> 00:25:22.812 huda: How should I frame it then? 176 00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.190 huda: I'm not sure how to like 177 00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.160 huda: segue into 178 00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.330 huda: like me getting started with coding. 179 00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.550 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 180 00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.940 Jenny Duan: maybe it's something about like how, instead of finding, like the your. 181 00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.890 Jenny Duan: instead of finding, like your dream world out there, you decide to create your own. 182 00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.560 Jenny Duan: or something like that. 183 00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.670 Jenny Duan: I don't know exactly. 184 00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.319 huda: Yeah, let me see how I go with that. 185 00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.719 huda: Maybe I could be like 186 00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.389 huda: like 187 00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.029 huda: the the scenery of like 188 00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.343 huda: castles and 189 00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.200 huda: castles and 190 00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.670 huda: fun. 191 00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:42.979 huda: Something it would just be like. The scenery of a castle contrasted my town, but I raced home so I could build it on my own. 192 00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.242 huda: maybe like not outside, but it could be like 193 00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.550 huda: Let me just like write it down. Maybe. 194 00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.110 Jenny Duan: Okay. 195 00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.820 huda: Maybe something like this. I'm not sure. 196 00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:54.760 Jenny Duan: I feel like these 2 parts are still wordy like. I don't think it. The transition is strong enough yet, but I think this is a good start. 197 00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.760 huda: Yeah, I think this sentence I wanna get rid of or change or something. 198 00:29:01.695 --> 00:29:05.269 huda: This like this bit works. 199 00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.110 Jenny Duan: So 200 00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.169 Jenny Duan: I think that like. 201 00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.960 Jenny Duan: okay. 202 00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:20.439 Jenny Duan: I think that if you're going to say contrasting, then we need to make sure that it's contrasting to something. 203 00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:29.769 Jenny Duan: because right now it's not contrasting the buzz of technology in your community. So you know, make sure that the transition is like directly contrasting what is before. 204 00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.710 Jenny Duan: Oh. 205 00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.850 Jenny Duan: I think that's the only thing to note here 206 00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.050 Jenny Duan: here. Oh, go ahead. 207 00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:54.509 huda: Alright, instead of adding this bit about, like everyone in my community was in, was like interested in technology. I can just get rid of that whole thing, and just like talk about like like being in like like a rural farmland, and like being surrounded by like 208 00:29:54.650 --> 00:30:02.060 huda: like kind of the opposite of like a technology like a place of technology. And then, like, right after that, I can have this transition. I guess. 209 00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:03.935 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 210 00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.869 huda: Or do you think this is important to keep. 211 00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.630 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's important. I don't think it makes sense in the context of where you are right now. 212 00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.090 Jenny Duan: Okay. 213 00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.540 huda: And I could be more descriptive here. So we like 214 00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.600 huda: that. 215 00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:45.160 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 216 00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.859 Jenny Duan: I think this is still like a very. It's a very long sentence. 217 00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.140 Jenny Duan: Is there a way you can shorten it a little bit. 218 00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:08.349 Jenny Duan: How old were you when you 1st started creating? Maybe that would be an important piece of context. You could add. 219 00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:10.710 huda: I guess I was 220 00:31:11.409 --> 00:31:11.989 huda: like 221 00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.260 huda: 9. 222 00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.495 Jenny Duan: Okay, 223 00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.970 Jenny Duan: as a 224 00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.780 Jenny Duan: substitute. This word for something else 225 00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.100 Jenny Duan: as a curious 9 year old. 226 00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:37.099 Jenny Duan: Because, like, you need to kind of maybe set the stage for? Why you're thinking of castles and skyscrapers. 227 00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.280 Jenny Duan: So yeah. 228 00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.189 Jenny Duan: cause it's like, cause you're 9 right? That makes total sense. 229 00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.979 huda: Maybe like imaginative, but I don't know if that's too like 230 00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.690 huda: I'd also appreciate. 231 00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.400 Jenny Duan: Why don't we put that in for now? 232 00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.250 huda: Maybe, like I could separate this sentence. So it's not as long. 233 00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.300 Jenny Duan: Yes. 234 00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:17.379 Jenny Duan: I think. Think that I maybe I'm still stuck on. Here is is, can we turn this to active voice instead of passive voice. 235 00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.919 Jenny Duan: let me make a note of that. 236 00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.399 huda: If I'm talking about like myself as a 9 year old 237 00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.820 huda: would I still be able to do that? 238 00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:43.289 Jenny Duan: as manager 9 year old. My mind was filled with scenes of castles and skyscrapers. 239 00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.140 Jenny Duan: something like that. 240 00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.060 huda: Alright! 241 00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:30.440 Jenny Duan: I think this is not maybe also not grammatically correct, because it's not your hands that are binging Youtube videos. It's you that are binging videos. So 242 00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.919 Jenny Duan: yeah, maybe we can change the the sentence structure here, too. 243 00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.490 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's better. 244 00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.320 huda: Maybe like that, rambled might not make sense. 245 00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.839 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe just about. 246 00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:40.769 huda: Yeah. And also, I think I don't know how to mention it. But maybe I can connect it back to like like, why, like 247 00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.479 huda: arrays and variables help me build my own, because I think that might. I don't think I make that. 248 00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.080 Jenny Duan: Tab. 249 00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:52.010 Jenny Duan: I think that would be helpful, especially for the reader, who might not have context about what all these things mean. 250 00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.580 huda: Hmm. 251 00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.940 Jenny Duan: I still don't love this. 252 00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.140 Jenny Duan: It's 1 sentence. 253 00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.597 huda: Maybe like I feel like contrasting 254 00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.820 huda: like I feel like that should be before like like 255 00:36:14.087 --> 00:36:15.879 huda: actually, I don't know. 256 00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.020 huda: Maybe I could do something like 257 00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.690 huda: like 258 00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.560 huda: as an imaginative 9 year old. 259 00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.569 huda: I saw like. 260 00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.571 huda: for example, like I saw the 261 00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.690 huda: piles of dirt 262 00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:44.850 huda: as 263 00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.340 huda: yes. 264 00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.009 Jenny Duan: That would be so good. Highlight, your imagination. 265 00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.100 huda: Okay. 266 00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.020 Jenny Duan: That's a really good idea. 267 00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.569 huda: And then I actually. But then I have to go into like how I decided to make my own 268 00:37:16.953 --> 00:37:20.386 huda: or maybe in something like decided to build my own 269 00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:26.500 huda: like, maybe I wanted to be like real or something. I don't know how to transition into that. 270 00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.139 Jenny Duan: You're in a stage. So I decided to build my own. 271 00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.930 huda: Okay. 272 00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.560 Jenny Duan: Lindy. 273 00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:53.029 Jenny Duan: I think another thing you can justify you have to justify here is why, as a 9 year old, is computer science like your 1st solution like, why don't you just play in the dirt. 274 00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.819 Jenny Duan: or like draw stuff in the dirt like, why did you turn to the computer. 275 00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.580 huda: maybe like. 276 00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.170 huda: well, for one, I think 277 00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:06.875 huda: computer science like made it so that 278 00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.250 huda: it was kind of real, I guess, like. So I can actually like. 279 00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:23.769 huda: I don't know, like I can code like an actual skyscraper and like castles, and actually be in them as opposed to like just imagining like these different things. And maybe it allowed me to like 280 00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:30.720 huda: like again, kind of going back to like the personal statement. But it allowed me to like kind of explore, like a different 281 00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:31.910 huda: like 282 00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.729 huda: different setting as opposed to like, just like normal town. 283 00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.650 huda: But 284 00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:40.559 huda: like, yeah, I don't know how to like briefly say that 285 00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.320 huda: alright. 286 00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.800 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 287 00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.440 Jenny Duan: Say it. Say it not briefly, and we can pare it down. 288 00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.350 huda: Oh, maybe another way I could say is like 289 00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.140 huda: I saw like. 290 00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:57.680 huda: for example. 291 00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.680 huda: my dad 292 00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.450 huda: turning like 293 00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.410 huda: I don't know, like 294 00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.180 huda: I don't know, like products into like 295 00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.650 huda: code or or like products. 296 00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.419 huda: like ideas into products using code. 297 00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:28.349 huda: So then, like, I thought that maybe that could be my solution from turning like for to turn like these like piles of dirt into skyscrapers. Maybe something like that. 298 00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:32.370 Jenny Duan: Can you write that down? And we can just see what it looks like in the context of this essay. 299 00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:19.159 huda: Something like that. Maybe like, maybe so it fits better, though. 300 00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.529 huda: like, so it's not as a drop abrupt. 301 00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:35.119 huda: And then if I had that bit. Then I'd have to like remove this as well. 302 00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 303 00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.580 huda: He, like initiates like 304 00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.329 huda: like, or introduces, like the aspect. 305 00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:44.480 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 306 00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:55.359 Jenny Duan: look at school. Look at your Stanford essay right now. 307 00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.150 Jenny Duan: Let's see how that one addresses this. 308 00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:52.860 Jenny Duan: I kind of like this. The almond tree essay, and I feel like it could be adapted to this essay, too. 309 00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.210 Jenny Duan: I. 310 00:41:54.210 --> 00:42:03.949 huda: I try. I actually had that originally and I'm trying to make it fit. But I just I don't know. I feel like it doesn't really match the prompt as much. And like 311 00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:08.449 huda: I mean, I guess there's a way to fix it. 312 00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:09.850 huda: But yeah. 313 00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.370 huda: I mean, like, I think I could try that. 314 00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.610 Jenny Duan: Let me paste it in. 315 00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.289 huda: And this one, I think this prompt is more focused on like like. 316 00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.210 huda: what are your like diversities 317 00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.980 huda: and like, how can you contribute to like make 318 00:42:36.718 --> 00:42:39.189 huda: viterbi usc viterbi more. 319 00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.390 huda: I guess. Diverse 320 00:42:42.418 --> 00:42:44.890 huda: and then this one 321 00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.950 huda: yeah, I mean, I guess there's a way. 322 00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.879 Jenny Duan: You can see this. 323 00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.100 huda: Wait, would it cause? Okay, I think, like the iconic tree for 324 00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.909 huda: for Usc is like palm trees. But I don't know if I should mention that 325 00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.830 huda: cause. I kind of like the. 326 00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.859 Jenny Duan: What are the other Usc symbols. 327 00:43:50.890 --> 00:44:00.489 huda: Like the Trojan. And there's the like. The actual mascot of Usc is a mustang. Actually. 328 00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.000 huda: yeah. 329 00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:05.600 huda: hmm. 330 00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:27.160 Jenny Duan: Is there a main 331 00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.340 Jenny Duan: main square in Usc. 332 00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.690 huda: yeah, I think so. It's like. 333 00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.330 huda: I don't know what it's called. Actually. 334 00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.780 Jenny Duan: Mccarthy way. 335 00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.630 Jenny Duan: Maybe we can change it to like 336 00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:19.780 Jenny Duan: instead of Usc. We could do like 337 00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.040 Jenny Duan: a famous tree on Usc. 338 00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:26.099 huda: No. 339 00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.010 huda: maybe like 340 00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:55.800 huda: the 341 00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.719 huda: there's like the this, like area called the oh, wait, no. 342 00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.400 huda: let me just double check. This is 343 00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.000 huda: you like the correct Usc. 344 00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.760 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 345 00:46:23.063 --> 00:46:24.779 huda: I'm searching, and there's like 346 00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.970 huda: there's a street in La. But I'm not sure if it's like specific to Usc. 347 00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.580 Jenny Duan: What's it called. 348 00:46:35.565 --> 00:46:40.540 huda: I don't know how to pronounce it. Let me put it in the chat. 349 00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:42.060 huda: Okay. 350 00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.659 Jenny Duan: You know? What 351 00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.769 Jenny Duan: is it like? Would people at Usc know it? 352 00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.340 huda: I think so, because there's like 353 00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:00.699 huda: it's like the 1st thing that shows up when you 354 00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.729 huda: let me see. 355 00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:41.400 Jenny Duan: I think this is this will work. I think all you need to do is just fill in the rest of this one paragraph and be specific about, like your your background, your culture identity, and how you'll use it to change Usc. And then I think it could be good. What do you think. 356 00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:44.220 huda: Yeah, 357 00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:54.000 huda: that looks good. So would should I do something similar to like with Stanford? How I listed like a couple of opportunities I'd be interested in or like. 358 00:47:54.040 --> 00:48:00.440 huda: or is it more like, I actually no, I think that one's more focused on like the 1st essay. So with this 359 00:48:01.102 --> 00:48:03.219 huda: should I talk about like, how 360 00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:09.575 huda: like my diversities caused me like like an adversity? 361 00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:17.640 huda: like or like how it's causing problems? Or is it like more about like how I've used it to like my strengths. 362 00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:24.400 Jenny Duan: I think it's how you've used it to your strengths, and how you will continue to use it to impact other people. 363 00:48:25.657 --> 00:48:34.569 huda: So like, should I mention anything about like like being like the only muslim, like girl in like Hackathon, club, or like 364 00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:40.189 huda: like any of those kind of related experiences. 365 00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:52.646 Jenny Duan: I think that you should. I think you should, but don't paint it so much in, in terms of your adversity. Paint it more so in the 366 00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:57.180 Jenny Duan: in the context of your strengths, and how you leverage your adversity. 367 00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:02.679 huda: Okay. So I think, then I can like focus on like impact. AI as well. 368 00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:05.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely. Cause I don't see you. 369 00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:09.760 Jenny Duan: I don't see you like right about empowering AI in other places. 370 00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.420 huda: Okay, great 371 00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:25.100 huda: maybe like over here. And instead of saying, like, I leverage my Indian Muslim, I can start off by talking about like how 372 00:49:25.745 --> 00:49:31.280 huda: like. So since I'm saying, I'm an improvising innovator, I can talk about like how like 373 00:49:32.154 --> 00:49:32.979 huda: being 374 00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.769 huda: like not feeling represented in like 375 00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:42.330 huda: tech clubs has like made me have to improvise, and then, like innovate empowering AI. Maybe. 376 00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:52.590 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that's really good, because you want to demonstrate that you have previous experience like leveraging your background to make change, and that you're going to continue to do so at Usc. 377 00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:55.730 huda: bam. 378 00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.240 Jenny Duan: Like, I think this 379 00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:03.040 Jenny Duan: is a little bit fluffy. 380 00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.499 Jenny Duan: Right here. I think it's like, be more specific. 381 00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:30.139 Jenny Duan: Okay? But I think you can fill that in in your own time. But I feel like this like, I really like this essay, and I feel like this is a bit stronger than this essay, because it's just more descriptive. And I can clearly see, like you already using your background to make change through engineering through computer science already. So it's that continuity that they'd like to see. 382 00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.150 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 383 00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:38.239 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest similarity right now is between this essay and essay one. I feel like right now, they're basically saying 384 00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.139 Jenny Duan: the same thing. 385 00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:52.889 huda: I think then I'd probably change like the 1st one to talk more about like other experiences other than centuria. Maybe. 386 00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:54.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 387 00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:57.699 huda: Actually, cause I'm worried because that one I wanna like 388 00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.513 huda: I feel like Synthoria is like one of my greater projects. And 389 00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:05.900 huda: like that one's like for general like, like the 390 00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:21.440 huda: it's like. For like a normal essay that, like the college admission officer will read, but this one's like specific to like Viterbi, and so I don't know if that one's like more important than this one. So I should like put more emphasis of Cynthor on that one but 391 00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:28.530 huda: actually, let me see if there's any other topics that I do like stuff for, which is like. 392 00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:36.350 Jenny Duan: I feel like advancing personalized learning is pretty good, though I think that's a good fit. I think maybe we can just figure out how to frame synthoria differently in both this. 393 00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.710 huda: Hmm. 394 00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.734 huda: so 395 00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:00.610 huda: maybe 396 00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:10.220 huda: I can talk more about like in Cynthoria. I talk about like how it's teaching AI ethics and data science. And then maybe here, instead of talking about like 397 00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.880 huda: like Synthoria, like 398 00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:21.220 huda: like the game itself, I think I should maybe like focus on like how I distribute it to more classrooms. Maybe. 399 00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be really good. 400 00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:29.119 huda: Yeah, but I don't know if that's still kind of like like still saying the same thing. 401 00:52:31.778 --> 00:52:35.089 Jenny Duan: Let me look at your activities list and see 402 00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.790 Jenny Duan: you haven't talked about. 403 00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:43.169 Jenny Duan: You haven't not? You haven't talked about like journalism very much at all. 404 00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.940 Jenny Duan: Code with classy. You haven't talked about data, visualization. 405 00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.980 Jenny Duan: even talked about data visualization or women in games. 406 00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.499 huda: Think I've talked about data journalism, or sorry. 407 00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.870 Jenny Duan: Data visualization with codeless, glossy. 408 00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:05.990 huda: Oh. 409 00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.110 huda: yeah, I think. 410 00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:12.670 Jenny Duan: Synthoria could be a mention in your 1st essay. But then you focus more on 411 00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:18.370 Jenny Duan: other computer science experiences that you have. And then synthoria can be the focus of your other essay. 412 00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:21.429 huda: Wait. What should I focus on for this one. 413 00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.249 Jenny Duan: For the 1st essay, I would say, maybe like 414 00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:31.860 Jenny Duan: Code, with classy, or like other Cs experiences, that you've had like women in games, and being an ambassador for them. 415 00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:33.600 huda: Okay. 416 00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.590 Jenny Duan: And you can still mention Synthoria. 417 00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.370 Jenny Duan: But you just don't have to write too much about it. 418 00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:56.149 huda: And so would I still be talking about like cause I know, like in the beginning I talked about like I also talked about how gaming can be like powerful educators. Should I shift that into like something different, like more about 419 00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:06.129 huda: like, oh, maybe I could talk about like how, instead of just like talk about education. It could. I could talk about like how gaming can be like 420 00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:21.480 huda: advocacy or advocacy, and talk about the games for good, podcast to like slightly mention synthoria, and then talking about like game, or like women in games and talking about like, how? I did a workshop. 421 00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.679 huda: or I think I don't know if that like reiterates what I talked about my personal statement. 422 00:54:26.145 --> 00:54:28.809 huda: Cause, I already mentioned in my personal statement. But 423 00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:32.120 huda: yeah, like. 424 00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.539 huda: if I wanted to slightly mention like 425 00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:44.889 huda: advocacy through through video games, I can talk about the games for good and synthoria like briefly, and then, like the larger focus could be. 426 00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:55.589 huda: wait. Okay, wait. Do you think it's okay? If I mentioned like the workshop, I hosted again, or is it too much? Since I already mentioned in my personal essay. 427 00:54:55.590 --> 00:55:03.610 Jenny Duan: I would avoid mentioning things twice, especially because you haven't mentioned women and games. You haven't really mentioned tech tiktoks or 428 00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:21.389 Jenny Duan: hackathons. You haven't mentioned J. Camp anywhere in these essays, or really Filmmakers club much either, or empowering AI, that much so like. There's, I think, because you have so much that you haven't covered, and not that you need to cover everything, but because there's so much you haven't covered. Maybe it would be good not to repeat things. 429 00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:24.890 huda: Okay, so no women in games. 430 00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:37.040 Jenny Duan: Maybe like when I say, don't repeat, it's like you can mention it, but you don't have to write so much detail about it. So if you write like one mention, that's totally fine. But just don't write more than like 2 sentences or one sentence. 431 00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:51.479 huda: Yeah, I'm trying to figure out like what should be like my main focus for this essay. Because I know, I wanna briefly mention, like since using the games for good. Example, because I don't think I talked about that. But I also like 432 00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:57.279 huda: it's also like synthia related. But it's like a different angle, because it's advocacy rather than education. 433 00:55:57.702 --> 00:56:03.679 huda: But like another thing, cause, it has to be related to game development, too, because that's my 1st 434 00:56:04.114 --> 00:56:05.529 huda: choice Major. I think. 435 00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:12.230 Jenny Duan: So why do you want to create games? Is it just for education or like? Is there another aspect of games that you care a lot about? 436 00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:16.090 huda: There's also like advocacy, because, like. 437 00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:39.770 huda: like, 1st of all, there's a lot of like represent like representation. Video games is like, as I already mentioned my personal statement, like, it's like a large aspect, like how people view themselves and like other people. And so like, I think like advocacy that's done through video games is also like, really a large part of why I developed video games, not just like 438 00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.100 huda: technical education, or like. 439 00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:48.739 huda: yeah, like teaching people things. It's also about like advocating for problems. 440 00:56:49.863 --> 00:56:50.686 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 441 00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:58.930 Jenny Duan: what? What got you into gaming? In the 1st place, I feel like. 442 00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:05.220 Jenny Duan: think this census whole paragraph can maybe be like 443 00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:07.049 Jenny Duan: deleted or moved. 444 00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.120 huda: Yeah. 445 00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.019 huda: okay, wait. So I'm just sent like 446 00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:21.510 huda: for this essay. What should I? What should I focus on then, if it's not gaming for education? 447 00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:36.860 Jenny Duan: So why are you interested in games and like, what got you interested in games like? I think when you were maybe 5 years old when you were playing a game. Your 1st thought was not like, I'm going to use this for advocacy, or I'm going to use this for Xyz. It's just like this is fun. So maybe you can walk them through like your evolution of. 448 00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:40.160 Jenny Duan: I guess. Here you kind of do that. But I think. 449 00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:45.320 Jenny Duan: like you don't have to mention so many games. You can maybe, just in the context of like one or 2 games. 450 00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.590 Jenny Duan: Talk about why 451 00:57:48.630 --> 00:58:02.989 Jenny Duan: gaming is important to you and like why, storytelling is important to you. Maybe, like as you as you play the role of a character, you were able to like, experience their challenges, or you felt like you were like a part of that, or like they helped you learn something about yourself. And like 452 00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:19.059 Jenny Duan: we need this story to feel a little bit continuous, because you're also talking about journalism. So you can see like in playing a certain character made you feel this way which helped you go in this direction. And then you learned that like games could be powerful tools for telling stories more than just entertainment, and then 453 00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:32.880 Jenny Duan: through games. We can understand the human experience or other people's experiences better. And that's why you want to use games as a method for advocacy, because it's such a digestible format. Everyone can play a game, but games can teach us so much. 454 00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:40.895 Jenny Duan: not only about the world, but about ourselves, and about understanding other people by like playing as other people. I really liked what you wrote in 455 00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:53.179 Jenny Duan: I think it was a stand for no, maybe in your in your main essay in your main essay about like how games or how building, like your naming your characters, how that was like 456 00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:59.650 Jenny Duan: a method of getting empathy with your players. So I think you can say something similar here. 457 00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:01.110 huda: Hmm. 458 00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:02.140 Jenny Duan: But just like 459 00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:10.389 Jenny Duan: connected to how like games enable you to tell stories. And then like cause. That's your focus with games and journalism. That's the like. T. 460 00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:11.930 huda: Yeah. 461 00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.929 huda: okay, so 462 00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.499 huda: okay, so storytelling. And 463 00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:23.270 huda: I, okay, so I can connect the data visualization with 464 00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:26.710 huda: journalism here. When I talk about data journalism. 465 00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:28.670 huda: Actually, I don't know how to like 466 00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:31.370 huda: like, I'll try, like 467 00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:38.389 huda: in my next stuff. I'll try and like, connect the code with glossy data visualization. But also I'm not sure how soon. 468 00:59:38.635 --> 00:59:43.790 Jenny Duan: Connect. And that's totally it's okay. It's also okay, cause you only have 2 50 words, which is not a lot. 469 00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:45.410 huda: Yeah. 470 00:59:46.263 --> 00:59:50.259 huda: Okay, then, other than that, I'll I'll focus on like the 471 00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.269 huda: like, the storytelling aspect. 472 00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.560 huda: And maybe 473 00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.730 huda: hmm. 474 00:59:56.730 --> 00:59:58.939 Jenny Duan: I think it can also be emphasized. Like. 475 00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.609 Jenny Duan: why? Usc, specifically 476 01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.789 Jenny Duan: this is great 477 01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:05.100 Jenny Duan: the like 478 01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.430 Jenny Duan: this is a little bit fluffy. 479 01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:13.939 Jenny Duan: but it's fine, because the last sentence. But I like this. 480 01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:25.419 Jenny Duan: But if you could maybe add a little bit more about why Usc, specifically, because, you know, other schools have interdisciplinary learning. Other schools have like game majors. So why is Usc so special. 481 01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.610 huda: okay. 482 01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:32.780 Jenny Duan: So to start out this essay. 483 01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:52.719 Jenny Duan: something you would consider. You don't necessarily need to do this like I like this, too. I don't think you need to mention all of these games like Mario Kart Portal Zelda, like Metros. I don't think you need to mention all of that. Maybe just start with one game that you played when you were a kid that was impactful to you in some way, and then right and then continue from there. 484 01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.350 huda: Okay. 485 01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:01.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah, does that make like, how do you? How are you feeling about this? And do you have any thoughts on this. 486 01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.780 huda: Yeah, I think 487 01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.149 huda: I think I like this new like, I like this new take, I guess. 488 01:01:09.882 --> 01:01:14.870 huda: it might be a little difficult like trying to weave in like a different extracurricular 489 01:01:15.193 --> 01:01:20.790 huda: but I mean, I think I'll I'll try like, even if it doesn't look too smooth. I guess I could fix that later. But 490 01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:21.950 huda: yeah. 491 01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:43.700 Jenny Duan: And I think if you want to write about synthoria, that's also fine, because, like that is a game that you that you built so obviously, it's very relevant. So maybe you could write about the process of building synthoria, too, and like what it was like to like, use unity or what it was like to like. Design your own characters, because you also did all your character design, like that art process, is also really important, like 492 01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:59.210 Jenny Duan: how you coded like their decisions. And you simplified an ethical issue into like a series of if if then statements or like, you know, like computer logic, like, I think there's other ways that you can look at synthoria that are not just the ed tech aspect that are really valuable in the game. 493 01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.560 huda: Yeah. 494 01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.409 Jenny Duan: No, yeah. How does that feel to you? 495 01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:13.170 huda: Yeah, I think that's great. And I think I can highlight more about like how I went about storytelling through synthoria. 496 01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:15.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, right? 497 01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:25.329 Jenny Duan: Okay. When is the next time you want to meet? I'm actually going to la this weekend I won't be at Usc. But I'll be in La. But what time do you want to meet 498 01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.309 Jenny Duan: so you can. 499 01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.670 huda: Are you still available on Sunday? 500 01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:33.040 Jenny Duan: Sunday. So 501 01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:37.100 Jenny Duan: it I cannot say for sure, because 502 01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:42.987 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna be driving. So the best times for me would probably be like Saturday night 503 01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:45.489 Jenny Duan: like later at night or 504 01:02:45.600 --> 01:03:01.409 Jenny Duan: Sunday. But and Sunday I might not be able to like. I'm gonna be on a car back, so I don't know how stable my Internet connection is. I don't want to bet on Sunday. So Monday or Monday might be nice, like Monday evening. I'm fully free, or Saturday evening 505 01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:02.939 Jenny Duan: would be good. 506 01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:10.379 huda: I think let's do Monday, then. Because yeah, I wanna get as many changes as possible. But before then. 507 01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:21.820 Jenny Duan: Then, if we have, if you end up making changes. In the meantime, if you just text me, I can like, look at stuff and give you comments asynchronously, too. And then same with your Ucsas uauc. 508 01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:26.159 Jenny Duan: I think it's just yeah. You see. Ucs, right? Anything else that's. 509 01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.750 huda: Those are like the main ones. And then 510 01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.899 huda: I mean, like, there's also like 511 01:03:32.401 --> 01:03:34.858 huda: This one Ronald Reagan scholarship. 512 01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:36.270 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay. 513 01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.049 huda: Yeah, I was. 514 01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.949 huda: I think I might start writing the essay soon, but I think the deadline is like. 515 01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.380 Jenny Duan: The deadline's what. 516 01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:50.079 huda: It's like later. So I have a little bit of time. 517 01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.139 Jenny Duan: Okay, there's also the Elk scholarship. Don't forget about that. 518 01:03:54.718 --> 01:03:58.501 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. Let's meet on Monday, maybe. Let's say 519 01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:04.179 Jenny Duan: I don't know, like 7, 6, 30. I don't know what's a good time for you. 520 01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.559 huda: Yeah, 6, 30 is actually. 521 01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:14.379 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do that on Monday, and just send me stuff as you write it, and I can get feedback to you. Okay. 522 01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:17.499 Jenny Duan: alright, keep it up.",

How are you? 2 00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.110 huda: Hi! I'm doing well. How are you. 3 00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm doing good as well, too. Good to see you. How's your week been? What have you been up to? 4 00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:39.290 huda: It's been pretty great. I had a statistics test, and I think I did pretty well on that 5 00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.729 huda: and I mean, like, there's not really many updates. But yeah. 6 00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.459 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, that sounds good. I'm glad that it's been like pretty chill. 7 00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:54.081 Jenny Duan: I think that maybe we can just get started. 8 00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.499 Jenny Duan: we can start by finalizing the Uscses. Is that okay? With you? 9 00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.489 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me open those right now. 10 00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.220 Jenny Duan: Okay. 11 00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.529 Jenny Duan: on the document. 12 00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.270 Jenny Duan: I want to finish looking at your short answers first.st 13 00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:26.570 huda: Yeah, actually, I reworded some of them, and I came up with alternatives for some of them. Like, for example, the one the one about 14 00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.790 huda: that. Yeah. 15 00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.260 huda: I can look at a little funnier version, but I don't know if it's doing professional. 16 00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.180 Jenny Duan: Hmm 17 00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.420 Jenny Duan: is kisses the right word here. 18 00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.139 Jenny Duan: cause I don't know if, like camera kisses the huggy. Sophia is the right. 19 00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.809 huda: Yeah, I mean, I think it could be worded differently. 20 00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.259 Jenny Duan: There another word you can think of in this. 21 00:04:04.880 --> 0",
    "0:04:10.299 huda: I think it'd just be like meets the West, and my camera meets the huggy Huggia, Sophia. 22 00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.699 huda: I don't know if this is like correct, but it could also be like the East frames the West. 23 00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.429 Jenny Duan: I wouldn't say that. Maybe let me 24 00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.850 Jenny Duan: is meets 25 00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.830 Jenny Duan: meets. Maybe 26 00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.133 Jenny Duan: meats might be good. What's another thing meets, and 27 00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.170 Jenny Duan: interesting. 28 00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.660 huda: Crosses. 29 00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.290 Jenny Duan: Like, maybe something you could do is 30 00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.320 Jenny Duan: like you could have 2 words that are different words, but like similar sounds. 31 00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:23.270 Jenny Duan: So, for example, like like kisses and crosses, you know, like those kind of sound the same, but they're not the same word. So if you find 2 like, maybe not those exact words, but if you find 2 words that are pretty similar within sound, you could use those 2 instead. 32 00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.459 huda: any captures, crosses and captures. 33 00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 34 00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.180 Jenny Duan: okay, we have a like 4 characters to to cut here. 35 00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:38.010 huda: Maybe you could just like the plus could be 36 00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.410 huda: fine, and then, like no period, maybe. 37 00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.190 huda: let me see how it looks. 38 00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.459 huda: That's 1 on one. 39 00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.490 huda: maybe, where the east and west cross in my camera. 40 00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.649 huda: And the yeah. But I feel like that breaks up like the 41 00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.310 huda: like the thing where it says, like my camera captures the huggy, Sophia. 42 00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.840 huda: Maybe like we ",
    "don't need the 43 00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.320 huda: or maybe like even like the peer at the end, might do something. 44 00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.290 Jenny Duan: I think that, though is necessary. 45 00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.900 huda: Hmm. 46 00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.670 Jenny Duan: That's fine. If you want to change daily 47 00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.060 Jenny Duan: instead of of course you could change it to daily, but I don't know if that captures. What you're trying to say. 48 00:08:54.107 --> 00:08:56.469 huda: I think. Yeah, daily works as well. 49 00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.979 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do that. 50 00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.830 huda: We actually, instead of this, can I? Can I do? And then like another 51 00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.929 huda: like that. 52 00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.750 Jenny Duan: That works, too. 53 00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah, sounds good. 54 00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.680 Jenny Duan: Oh. 55 00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.270 Jenny Duan: okay. Tell me about these these 3 different drafts that you put under here. 56 00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.459 huda: Yeah. So I actually like. 57 00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:54.219 huda: I read back like, I kind of like, read like the cover of like under the time entry. And I realized that it's about like I guess, like 58 00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:18.643 huda: there's like these flashbacks of like this woman who's like during the partition. And then she's like telling the story to someone like in modern day. And so like, I realize that it's like a lot similar to like when my grandma tells me stories. So that's kind of like where the second one is about, and also like a large, like a central part of what the story is about like realizing where your roots are from, and like 59 00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:37.089 huda: and like the kind of the growth away from like traumatic pasts, I guess, and so like these 3 options are kind of like. They're kind of alluding to that, but in different ways, like t",
    "he 1st one is more of like like a 1 sentence, kind of like explaining what like the whole moral of the story is. 60 00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:52.067 huda: and then, I guess, like the same with the 3rd one, and then the second one is more about like my personal like, how I feel about it and like because it reminds me of like when my grandma used to tell me stories, and also like 61 00:10:52.570 --> 00:11:03.839 huda: and also like the storytelling aspect. Because I think what's interesting about the book is it's also about like storytelling. And I'm a storyteller. So I think that's like also one thing that I took away from the book as well. 62 00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.189 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let me see. 63 00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.170 Jenny Duan: let me look at some examples to see what worked. 64 00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.651 Jenny Duan: Wait. I saw that online. 65 00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.960 Jenny Duan: people just answer. So if you want to. You could just answer without writing anything. 66 00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.319 huda: Honestly, yeah, I think that might be better. 67 00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 68 00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.369 huda: In that case, like if I 69 00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.050 huda: I might either go with the 1st one, or just like 70 00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.859 huda: just like the name of the book. 71 00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.059 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe 72 00:12:15.024 --> 00:12:20.200 Jenny Duan: I don't know. I think either are fine. I don't think you need to write something extremely 73 00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.549 Jenny Duan: in depth detail. 74 00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.580 huda: Okay, then I'll 75 00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.420 huda: I don't know what's that? 76 00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:48.479 huda: Maybe like, I feel like I can add this bit because it might show like a little bit about like how I think when I'm reading books, maybe. 77 00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.440 Jenny Duan: let me look at this guide. 78 00:1",
    "3:12.440 --> 00:13:13.470 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 79 00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.889 Jenny Duan: Which one do you think you're gonna go with this one. 80 00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.990 huda: Yeah, I think so. 81 00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.679 Jenny Duan: Go ahead. 82 00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.160 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could teach on the class on any topic. 83 00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.350 Jenny Duan: Oh, these are bad! 84 00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.050 Jenny Duan: Which one which one like feels more resonant with you. I think they're both good. 85 00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.190 huda: I feel like 86 00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.169 huda: the second one is a little more like. 87 00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:12.159 huda: I think, like I like the the beginning parts of liberation or label, because that's like also another trope labeling. So I think it addresses both things. So I think that would be more like interesting to teach. 88 00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.139 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. Let's go with that one. 89 00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:26.900 Jenny Duan: Okay, now, I want to start with this, too. So, okay, sorry. Do you feel comfortable with all of these short answer questions. 90 00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.840 huda: Yeah. 91 00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:34.970 Jenny Duan: Great. Yay. Okay, let's go to the 1st essay, which is, describe how you plan to pursue your academic interests. 92 00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.472 Jenny Duan: So actually, something that I noticed is 93 00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.910 Jenny Duan: like a lot of these are 94 00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.880 Jenny Duan: about gaming. I feel like it's not. It doesn't really show that 95 00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.120 Jenny Duan: enough of your character, because I think all your essays are about games. 96 00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.850 Jenny Duan: Obviously, this is this makes sense. Why, that's about games. 97 00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.389 Jenny Duan: This one. 98 00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.389 Jenny Duan: Okay, this one is not all abo",
    "ut games. This one's fine. 99 00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:12.800 Jenny Duan: I'm assuming you're going with this essay compared to the second essay, the growing up in a rural town where resources were scarce one. 100 00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.819 huda: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm I think I'm still working out the draft of the 1st one. But yeah. 101 00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.110 Jenny Duan: And then, okay. 102 00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.850 Jenny Duan: okay, I think, okay. Then, I think your essays are are okay. But I think 103 00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.010 Jenny Duan: we need to just make sure that they're unique enough so that they don't repeat the same themes over and over. 104 00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:39.269 huda: Yeah, this last one. It was like, you have to pick something that like one of the themes that stood out most. And then one of them was about like 105 00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:42.239 huda: like person 106 00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.050 huda: personalized like education. 107 00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.420 huda: So. 108 00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.930 huda: yeah. 109 00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.055 Jenny Duan: Okay, 110 00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.842 Jenny Duan: let's just start with this 1st one. 111 00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.349 Jenny Duan: this sentence, I think we can show. Instead of telling. 112 00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.190 Jenny Duan: So this one's like, you emphasize games for teaching. 113 00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:37.310 Jenny Duan: This is pretty similar to the other. Like essay number 3. 114 00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.530 Jenny Duan: Great. 115 00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.470 Jenny Duan: I love this. This is great. 116 00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:53.900 Jenny Duan: Thanks. 117 00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.020 Jenny Duan: Does Usc emphasize interdisciplinary learning a lot. 118 00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:32.389 huda: Yeah. Actually, when we went to tour there, that was like it was iterated so many times like, it's like every major, every built one time we went to like a building. Th",
    "ey're like, Oh, like, if you're a computer science major, you can even do like like something in the school of cinematic arts like they're really focused on like how there's no like one set like classes that you have to take. And you could take any, and it's like it's a really big deal on Usc. I think. 119 00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.210 Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah. 120 00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.500 Jenny Duan: great. 121 00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.040 Jenny Duan: Okay. 122 00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.519 Jenny Duan: I think that this. 123 00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.719 Jenny Duan: it's this is good, like, here is good 124 00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.509 Jenny Duan: But let me do some research 125 00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.129 Jenny Duan: on this, major. 126 00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.559 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't think you need the 127 00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.929 Jenny Duan: parentheses here. I think you can just say computer science games. 128 00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.390 huda: Okay. 129 00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.580 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 130 00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:02.590 Jenny Duan: So you say, storytelling twice, here. Is there another way you can reword this. 131 00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.489 huda: like, maybe 132 00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.490 huda: exploring narratives. 133 00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.490 huda: Yeah. 134 00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.570 Jenny Duan: Be good. 135 00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:35.950 Jenny Duan: Great! 136 00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:49.639 Jenny Duan: I wonder if you can write a different intro that doesn't mention centuria, and maybe something else about like building with Cs instead. 137 00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.780 huda: Hmm 138 00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.699 Jenny Duan: Let's come back to this. 139 00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.120 Jenny Duan: I want to come back to this beginning after we look at some of your other essays. 140 00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:07.730 Jenny Duan: just so we can see, like how to make this more unique. I think the bottom this is all good. I",
    " think it's just these 2 paragraphs that might need to be changed. 141 00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.510 Jenny Duan: What are your thoughts on this. 142 00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:19.149 huda: Yeah, I think, like, I think, like, all the issues are like, somehow a little similar. So it's like difficult to talk about anything, because I mean, like, I want to emphasize like 143 00:20:19.492 --> 00:20:27.919 huda: like a game developer, I think, because, like, that's like the major 1st choice, major that I'm applying for. But I think there are definitely ways like. 144 00:20:28.338 --> 00:20:43.849 huda: maybe that could be through like the women in games, ambassadorship, or like the games for change, podcast I mean the games podcast games for change award. So maybe I could use those instead of like cynthoria. 145 00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like that would be good. 146 00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.609 Jenny Duan: Let's look at some of your other essays first, st though. 147 00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.300 Jenny Duan: hmm. 148 00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.889 huda: Actually, I'm not done with this part yet, because I need to add a conclusion to it. But 149 00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.330 Jenny Duan: Wait. Do you want to review this, or do you want to just come back to it another time? 150 00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:15.420 huda: I think if we can review what I have so far and like, maybe you can tell me what I. 151 00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.489 Jenny Duan: I think this is 40.th 152 00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.480 Jenny Duan: Let's elaborate what rural town means. 153 00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.870 Jenny Duan: I think you can do a little bit more showing here, like, what does the what is a rural town? 154 00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.300 Jenny Duan: Not sure if secluded is the right word here. 155 00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.770 huda: I'm not like like 156 00:22:44.251 --> 00:22:46.509 huda: I don't know how else to describe it, like 157 00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:58.680 huda: a",
    "way from opportunities, and like kind of far away from other places, which is like why it leads like other people, or, like everyone in the town, wants to like, do something to innovate and like, do something with technology. 158 00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:00.540 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 159 00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.440 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 160 00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.209 Jenny Duan: I love this framework. 161 00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.050 Jenny Duan: and I think it translates well into this. 162 00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.400 Jenny Duan: So I think that, like 163 00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.699 Jenny Duan: what we can do is 164 00:23:49.370 --> 00:24:04.819 Jenny Duan: I. I think just this word secluded might be changed, because I feel like secluded is maybe not the right word, because I think Mountain House is still like, surrounded by other cities. But so it's not necessarily secluded. But maybe there's a different word we can 165 00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.180 Jenny Duan: use here. 166 00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.680 Jenny Duan: maybe like just rural, because now you just describe what rural means. So 167 00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.490 Jenny Duan: it's fine for now 168 00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.190 Jenny Duan: I think this 169 00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.469 Jenny Duan: we're this is a little bit wordy here. 170 00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.990 Jenny Duan: I think here you can. 171 00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:35.270 Jenny Duan: You can maybe talk about how like there wasn't much to do or like you. You were bored or like you couldn't find other activities. So you turned to like computer science. 172 00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.110 huda: okay, cool. 173 00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.468 Jenny Duan: I think this setting is a little bit 174 00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:17.720 Jenny Duan: it feels a little bit out of place. Because why are you dashing like? Why are you at the Park? In the 1st place, I think you're kind of plopping the reader into a scene where they don't have very much context. 175 00:",
    "25:20.727 --> 00:25:22.812 huda: How should I frame it then? 176 00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.190 huda: I'm not sure how to like 177 00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.160 huda: segue into 178 00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.330 huda: like me getting started with coding. 179 00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.550 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 180 00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.940 Jenny Duan: maybe it's something about like how, instead of finding, like the your. 181 00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.890 Jenny Duan: instead of finding, like your dream world out there, you decide to create your own. 182 00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.560 Jenny Duan: or something like that. 183 00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.670 Jenny Duan: I don't know exactly. 184 00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.319 huda: Yeah, let me see how I go with that. 185 00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.719 huda: Maybe I could be like 186 00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.389 huda: like 187 00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.029 huda: the the scenery of like 188 00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.343 huda: castles and 189 00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.200 huda: castles and 190 00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.670 huda: fun. 191 00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:42.979 huda: Something it would just be like. The scenery of a castle contrasted my town, but I raced home so I could build it on my own. 192 00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.242 huda: maybe like not outside, but it could be like 193 00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.550 huda: Let me just like write it down. Maybe. 194 00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.110 Jenny Duan: Okay. 195 00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.820 huda: Maybe something like this. I'm not sure. 196 00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:54.760 Jenny Duan: I feel like these 2 parts are still wordy like. I don't think it. The transition is strong enough yet, but I think this is a good start. 197 00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.760 huda: Yeah, I think this sentence I wanna get rid of or change or something. 198 00:29:01.695 --> 00:29:05.269 huda: This like this bit works. 199 00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.110 Jenny Duan: So 200 00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.169 Jenny ",
    "Duan: I think that like. 201 00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.960 Jenny Duan: okay. 202 00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:20.439 Jenny Duan: I think that if you're going to say contrasting, then we need to make sure that it's contrasting to something. 203 00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:29.769 Jenny Duan: because right now it's not contrasting the buzz of technology in your community. So you know, make sure that the transition is like directly contrasting what is before. 204 00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.710 Jenny Duan: Oh. 205 00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.850 Jenny Duan: I think that's the only thing to note here 206 00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.050 Jenny Duan: here. Oh, go ahead. 207 00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:54.509 huda: Alright, instead of adding this bit about, like everyone in my community was in, was like interested in technology. I can just get rid of that whole thing, and just like talk about like like being in like like a rural farmland, and like being surrounded by like 208 00:29:54.650 --> 00:30:02.060 huda: like kind of the opposite of like a technology like a place of technology. And then, like, right after that, I can have this transition. I guess. 209 00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:03.935 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 210 00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.869 huda: Or do you think this is important to keep. 211 00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.630 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's important. I don't think it makes sense in the context of where you are right now. 212 00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.090 Jenny Duan: Okay. 213 00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.540 huda: And I could be more descriptive here. So we like 214 00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.600 huda: that. 215 00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:45.160 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 216 00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.859 Jenny Duan: I think this is still like a very. It's a very long sentence. 217 00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.140 Jenny Duan: Is there a way you can shorten it a little bit. 218 00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:08.349 Jenny Duan: How old were you when you 1st started creating?

    " like how I decided to make my own 268 00:37:16.953 --> 00:37:20.386 huda: or maybe in something like decided to build my own 269 00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:26.500 huda: like, maybe I wanted to be like real or something. I don't know how to transition into that. 270 00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.139 Jenny Duan: You're in a stage. So I decided to build my own. 271 00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.930 huda: Okay. 272 00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.560 Jenny Duan: Lindy. 273 00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:53.029 Jenny Duan: I think another thing you can justify you have to justify here is why, as a 9 year old, is computer science like your 1st solution like, why don't you just play in the dirt. 274 00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.819 Jenny Duan: or like draw stuff in the dirt like, why did you turn to the computer. 275 00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.580 huda: maybe like. 276 00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.170 huda: well, for one, I think 277 00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:06.875 huda: computer science like made it so that 278 00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.250 huda: it was kind of real, I guess, like. So I can actually like. 279 00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:23.769 huda: I don't know, like I can code like an actual skyscraper and like castles, and actually be in them as opposed to like just imagining like these different things. And maybe it allowed me to like 280 00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:30.720 huda: like again, kind of going back to like the personal statement. But it allowed me to like kind of explore, like a different 281 00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:31.910 huda: like 282 00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.729 huda: different setting as opposed to like, just like normal town. 283 00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.650 huda: But 284 00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:40.559 huda: like, yeah, I don't know how to like briefly say that 285 00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.320 huda: alright. 286 00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.800 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 287 00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.440 Jenny Duan: Say it. Say it not briefly, and we can pare it down. 288 00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.350 huda",
    ": Oh, maybe another way I could say is like 289 00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.140 huda: I saw like. 290 00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:57.680 huda: for example. 291 00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.680 huda: my dad 292 00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.450 huda: turning like 293 00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.410 huda: I don't know, like 294 00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.180 huda: I don't know, like products into like 295 00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.650 huda: code or or like products. 296 00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.419 huda: like ideas into products using code. 297 00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:28.349 huda: So then, like, I thought that maybe that could be my solution from turning like for to turn like these like piles of dirt into skyscrapers. Maybe something like that. 298 00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:32.370 Jenny Duan: Can you write that down? And we can just see what it looks like in the context of this essay. 299 00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:19.159 huda: Something like that. Maybe like, maybe so it fits better, though. 300 00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.529 huda: like, so it's not as a drop abrupt. 301 00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:35.119 huda: And then if I had that bit. Then I'd have to like remove this as well. 302 00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 303 00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.580 huda: He, like initiates like 304 00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.329 huda: like, or introduces, like the aspect. 305 00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:44.480 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 306 00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:55.359 Jenny Duan: look at school. Look at your Stanford essay right now. 307 00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.150 Jenny Duan: Let's see how that one addresses this. 308 00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:52.860 Jenny Duan: I kind of like this. The almond tree essay, and I feel like it could be adapted to this essay, too. 309 00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.210 Jenny Duan: I. 310 00:41:54.210 --> 00:42:03.949 huda: I try. I actually had that originally and I'm trying to make it fit. But I just I don't know. I feel like it doesn't really match the prompt as much. And like 311 0",
    "0:42:05.422 --> 00:42:08.449 huda: I mean, I guess there's a way to fix it. 312 00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:09.850 huda: But yeah. 313 00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.370 huda: I mean, like, I think I could try that. 314 00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.610 Jenny Duan: Let me paste it in. 315 00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.289 huda: And this one, I think this prompt is more focused on like like. 316 00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.210 huda: what are your like diversities 317 00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.980 huda: and like, how can you contribute to like make 318 00:42:36.718 --> 00:42:39.189 huda: viterbi usc viterbi more. 319 00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.390 huda: I guess. Diverse 320 00:42:42.418 --> 00:42:44.890 huda: and then this one 321 00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.950 huda: yeah, I mean, I guess there's a way. 322 00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.879 Jenny Duan: You can see this. 323 00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.100 huda: Wait, would it cause? Okay, I think, like the iconic tree for 324 00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.909 huda: for Usc is like palm trees. But I don't know if I should mention that 325 00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.830 huda: cause. I kind of like the. 326 00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.859 Jenny Duan: What are the other Usc symbols. 327 00:43:50.890 --> 00:44:00.489 huda: Like the Trojan. And there's the like. The actual mascot of Usc is a mustang. Actually. 328 00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.000 huda: yeah. 329 00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:05.600 huda: hmm. 330 00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:27.160 Jenny Duan: Is there a main 331 00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.340 Jenny Duan: main square in Usc. 332 00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.690 huda: yeah, I think so. It's like. 333 00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.330 huda: I don't know what it's called. Actually. 334 00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.780 Jenny Duan: Mccarthy way. 335 00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.630 Jenny Duan: Maybe we can change it to like 336 00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:19.780 Jenny Duan: instead of Usc. We could do like 337 00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.040 Jenny Duan: a famous tree on Usc. 338 00:",
    "45:25.050 --> 00:45:26.099 huda: No. 339 00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.010 huda: maybe like 340 00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:55.800 huda: the 341 00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.719 huda: there's like the this, like area called the oh, wait, no. 342 00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.400 huda: let me just double check. This is 343 00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.000 huda: you like the correct Usc. 344 00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.760 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 345 00:46:23.063 --> 00:46:24.779 huda: I'm searching, and there's like 346 00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.970 huda: there's a street in La. But I'm not sure if it's like specific to Usc. 347 00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.580 Jenny Duan: What's it called. 348 00:46:35.565 --> 00:46:40.540 huda: I don't know how to pronounce it. Let me put it in the chat. 349 00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:42.060 huda: Okay. 350 00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.659 Jenny Duan: You know? What 351 00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.769 Jenny Duan: is it like? Would people at Usc know it? 352 00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.340 huda: I think so, because there's like 353 00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:00.699 huda: it's like the 1st thing that shows up when you 354 00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.729 huda: let me see. 355 00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:41.400 Jenny Duan: I think this is this will work. I think all you need to do is just fill in the rest of this one paragraph and be specific about, like your your background, your culture identity, and how you'll use it to change Usc. And then I think it could be good. What do you think. 356 00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:44.220 huda: Yeah, 357 00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:54.000 huda: that looks good. So would should I do something similar to like with Stanford? How I listed like a couple of opportunities I'd be interested in or like. 358 00:47:54.040 --> 00:48:00.440 huda: or is it more like, I actually no, I think that one's more focused on like the 1st essay. So with this 359 00:48:01.102 --> 00:48:03.219 huda: should I talk about like, how 360 00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:09.575 huda: like my diversiti",
    "es caused me like like an adversity? 361 00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:17.640 huda: like or like how it's causing problems? Or is it like more about like how I've used it to like my strengths. 362 00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:24.400 Jenny Duan: I think it's how you've used it to your strengths, and how you will continue to use it to impact other people. 363 00:48:25.657 --> 00:48:34.569 huda: So like, should I mention anything about like like being like the only muslim, like girl in like Hackathon, club, or like 364 00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:40.189 huda: like any of those kind of related experiences. 365 00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:52.646 Jenny Duan: I think that you should. I think you should, but don't paint it so much in, in terms of your adversity. Paint it more so in the 366 00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:57.180 Jenny Duan: in the context of your strengths, and how you leverage your adversity. 367 00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:02.679 huda: Okay. So I think, then I can like focus on like impact. AI as well. 368 00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:05.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely. Cause I don't see you. 369 00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:09.760 Jenny Duan: I don't see you like right about empowering AI in other places. 370 00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.420 huda: Okay, great 371 00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:25.100 huda: maybe like over here. And instead of saying, like, I leverage my Indian Muslim, I can start off by talking about like how 372 00:49:25.745 --> 00:49:31.280 huda: like. So since I'm saying, I'm an improvising innovator, I can talk about like how like 373 00:49:32.154 --> 00:49:32.979 huda: being 374 00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.769 huda: like not feeling represented in like 375 00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:42.330 huda: tech clubs has like made me have to improvise, and then, like innovate empowering AI. Maybe. 376 00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:52.590 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that's really good, because you want to demonstrate that you have previous experience like leveraging your background to make change, and t",
    "hat you're going to continue to do so at Usc. 377 00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:55.730 huda: bam. 378 00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.240 Jenny Duan: Like, I think this 379 00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:03.040 Jenny Duan: is a little bit fluffy. 380 00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.499 Jenny Duan: Right here. I think it's like, be more specific. 381 00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:30.139 Jenny Duan: Okay? But I think you can fill that in in your own time. But I feel like this like, I really like this essay, and I feel like this is a bit stronger than this essay, because it's just more descriptive. And I can clearly see, like you already using your background to make change through engineering through computer science already. So it's that continuity that they'd like to see. 382 00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.150 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 383 00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:38.239 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest similarity right now is between this essay and essay one. I feel like right now, they're basically saying 384 00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.139 Jenny Duan: the same thing. 385 00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:52.889 huda: I think then I'd probably change like the 1st one to talk more about like other experiences other than centuria. Maybe. 386 00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:54.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 387 00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:57.699 huda: Actually, cause I'm worried because that one I wanna like 388 00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.513 huda: I feel like Synthoria is like one of my greater projects. And 389 00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:05.900 huda: like that one's like for general like, like the 390 00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:21.440 huda: it's like. For like a normal essay that, like the college admission officer will read, but this one's like specific to like Viterbi, and so I don't know if that one's like more important than this one. So I should like put more emphasis of Cynthor on that one but 391 00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:28.530 huda: actually, let me see if there's any other topics that I do like stuff for, which is like. 392 00:51:28.530 --> 00:",
    "51:36.350 Jenny Duan: I feel like advancing personalized learning is pretty good, though I think that's a good fit. I think maybe we can just figure out how to frame synthoria differently in both this. 393 00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.710 huda: Hmm. 394 00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.734 huda: so 395 00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:00.610 huda: maybe 396 00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:10.220 huda: I can talk more about like in Cynthoria. I talk about like how it's teaching AI ethics and data science. And then maybe here, instead of talking about like 397 00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.880 huda: like Synthoria, like 398 00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:21.220 huda: like the game itself, I think I should maybe like focus on like how I distribute it to more classrooms. Maybe. 399 00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be really good. 400 00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:29.119 huda: Yeah, but I don't know if that's still kind of like like still saying the same thing. 401 00:52:31.778 --> 00:52:35.089 Jenny Duan: Let me look at your activities list and see 402 00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.790 Jenny Duan: you haven't talked about. 403 00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:43.169 Jenny Duan: You haven't not? You haven't talked about like journalism very much at all. 404 00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.940 Jenny Duan: Code with classy. You haven't talked about data, visualization. 405 00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.980 Jenny Duan: even talked about data visualization or women in games. 406 00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.499 huda: Think I've talked about data journalism, or sorry. 407 00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.870 Jenny Duan: Data visualization with codeless, glossy. 408 00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:05.990 huda: Oh. 409 00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.110 huda: yeah, I think. 410 00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:12.670 Jenny Duan: Synthoria could be a mention in your 1st essay. But then you focus more on 411 00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:18.370 Jenny Duan: other computer science experiences that you have. And then synthoria can be the focus of your other essay. 412",
    " 00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:21.429 huda: Wait. What should I focus on for this one. 413 00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.249 Jenny Duan: For the 1st essay, I would say, maybe like 414 00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:31.860 Jenny Duan: Code, with classy, or like other Cs experiences, that you've had like women in games, and being an ambassador for them. 415 00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:33.600 huda: Okay. 416 00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.590 Jenny Duan: And you can still mention Synthoria. 417 00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.370 Jenny Duan: But you just don't have to write too much about it. 418 00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:56.149 huda: And so would I still be talking about like cause I know, like in the beginning I talked about like I also talked about how gaming can be like powerful educators. Should I shift that into like something different, like more about 419 00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:06.129 huda: like, oh, maybe I could talk about like how, instead of just like talk about education. It could. I could talk about like how gaming can be like 420 00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:21.480 huda: advocacy or advocacy, and talk about the games for good, podcast to like slightly mention synthoria, and then talking about like game, or like women in games and talking about like, how? I did a workshop. 421 00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.679 huda: or I think I don't know if that like reiterates what I talked about my personal statement. 422 00:54:26.145 --> 00:54:28.809 huda: Cause, I already mentioned in my personal statement. But 423 00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:32.120 huda: yeah, like. 424 00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.539 huda: if I wanted to slightly mention like 425 00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:44.889 huda: advocacy through through video games, I can talk about the games for good and synthoria like briefly, and then, like the larger focus could be. 426 00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:55.589 huda: wait. Okay, wait. Do you think it's okay? If I mentioned like the workshop, I hosted again, or is it too much? Since I already mentioned in my personal essay.",
    " 427 00:54:55.590 --> 00:55:03.610 Jenny Duan: I would avoid mentioning things twice, especially because you haven't mentioned women and games. You haven't really mentioned tech tiktoks or 428 00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:21.389 Jenny Duan: hackathons. You haven't mentioned J. Camp anywhere in these essays, or really Filmmakers club much either, or empowering AI, that much so like. There's, I think, because you have so much that you haven't covered, and not that you need to cover everything, but because there's so much you haven't covered. Maybe it would be good not to repeat things. 429 00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:24.890 huda: Okay, so no women in games. 430 00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:37.040 Jenny Duan: Maybe like when I say, don't repeat, it's like you can mention it, but you don't have to write so much detail about it. So if you write like one mention, that's totally fine. But just don't write more than like 2 sentences or one sentence. 431 00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:51.479 huda: Yeah, I'm trying to figure out like what should be like my main focus for this essay. Because I know, I wanna briefly mention, like since using the games for good. Example, because I don't think I talked about that. But I also like 432 00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:57.279 huda: it's also like synthia related. But it's like a different angle, because it's advocacy rather than education. 433 00:55:57.702 --> 00:56:03.679 huda: But like another thing, cause, it has to be related to game development, too, because that's my 1st 434 00:56:04.114 --> 00:56:05.529 huda: choice Major. I think. 435 00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:12.230 Jenny Duan: So why do you want to create games? Is it just for education or like? Is there another aspect of games that you care a lot about? 436 00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:16.090 huda: There's also like advocacy, because, like. 437 00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:39.770 huda: like, 1st of all, there's a lot of like represent like representation. Video games is like, as I already mentioned my personal statement,",
    " like, it's like a large aspect, like how people view themselves and like other people. And so like, I think like advocacy that's done through video games is also like, really a large part of why I developed video games, not just like 438 00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.100 huda: technical education, or like. 439 00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:48.739 huda: yeah, like teaching people things. It's also about like advocating for problems. 440 00:56:49.863 --> 00:56:50.686 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 441 00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:58.930 Jenny Duan: what? What got you into gaming? In the 1st place, I feel like. 442 00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:05.220 Jenny Duan: think this census whole paragraph can maybe be like 443 00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:07.049 Jenny Duan: deleted or moved. 444 00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.120 huda: Yeah. 445 00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.019 huda: okay, wait. So I'm just sent like 446 00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:21.510 huda: for this essay. What should I? What should I focus on then, if it's not gaming for education? 447 00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:36.860 Jenny Duan: So why are you interested in games and like, what got you interested in games like? I think when you were maybe 5 years old when you were playing a game. Your 1st thought was not like, I'm going to use this for advocacy, or I'm going to use this for Xyz. It's just like this is fun. So maybe you can walk them through like your evolution of. 448 00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:40.160 Jenny Duan: I guess. Here you kind of do that. But I think. 449 00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:45.320 Jenny Duan: like you don't have to mention so many games. You can maybe, just in the context of like one or 2 games. 450 00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.590 Jenny Duan: Talk about why 451 00:57:48.630 --> 00:58:02.989 Jenny Duan: gaming is important to you and like why, storytelling is important to you. Maybe, like as you as you play the role of a character, you were able to like, experience their challenges, or you felt like you were like a part of that, or like they helped you lea",
    "rn something about yourself. And like 452 00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:19.059 Jenny Duan: we need this story to feel a little bit continuous, because you're also talking about journalism. So you can see like in playing a certain character made you feel this way which helped you go in this direction. And then you learned that like games could be powerful tools for telling stories more than just entertainment, and then 453 00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:32.880 Jenny Duan: through games. We can understand the human experience or other people's experiences better. And that's why you want to use games as a method for advocacy, because it's such a digestible format. Everyone can play a game, but games can teach us so much. 454 00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:40.895 Jenny Duan: not only about the world, but about ourselves, and about understanding other people by like playing as other people. I really liked what you wrote in 455 00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:53.179 Jenny Duan: I think it was a stand for no, maybe in your in your main essay in your main essay about like how games or how building, like your naming your characters, how that was like 456 00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:59.650 Jenny Duan: a method of getting empathy with your players. So I think you can say something similar here. 457 00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:01.110 huda: Hmm. 458 00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:02.140 Jenny Duan: But just like 459 00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:10.389 Jenny Duan: connected to how like games enable you to tell stories. And then like cause. That's your focus with games and journalism. That's the like. T. 460 00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:11.930 huda: Yeah. 461 00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.929 huda: okay, so 462 00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.499 huda: okay, so storytelling. And 463 00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:23.270 huda: I, okay, so I can connect the data visualization with 464 00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:26.710 huda: journalism here. When I talk about data journalism. 465 00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:28.670 huda: Actually, I don't know how to like 466 00:59:29.110",
    " --> 00:59:31.370 huda: like, I'll try, like 467 00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:38.389 huda: in my next stuff. I'll try and like, connect the code with glossy data visualization. But also I'm not sure how soon. 468 00:59:38.635 --> 00:59:43.790 Jenny Duan: Connect. And that's totally it's okay. It's also okay, cause you only have 2 50 words, which is not a lot. 469 00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:45.410 huda: Yeah. 470 00:59:46.263 --> 00:59:50.259 huda: Okay, then, other than that, I'll I'll focus on like the 471 00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.269 huda: like, the storytelling aspect. 472 00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.560 huda: And maybe 473 00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.730 huda: hmm. 474 00:59:56.730 --> 00:59:58.939 Jenny Duan: I think it can also be emphasized. Like. 475 00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.609 Jenny Duan: why? Usc, specifically 476 01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.789 Jenny Duan: this is great 477 01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:05.100 Jenny Duan: the like 478 01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.430 Jenny Duan: this is a little bit fluffy. 479 01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:13.939 Jenny Duan: but it's fine, because the last sentence. But I like this. 480 01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:25.419 Jenny Duan: But if you could maybe add a little bit more about why Usc, specifically, because, you know, other schools have interdisciplinary learning. Other schools have like game majors. So why is Usc so special. 481 01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.610 huda: okay. 482 01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:32.780 Jenny Duan: So to start out this essay. 483 01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:52.719 Jenny Duan: something you would consider. You don't necessarily need to do this like I like this, too. I don't think you need to mention all of these games like Mario Kart Portal Zelda, like Metros. I don't think you need to mention all of that. Maybe just start with one game that you played when you were a kid that was impactful to you in some way, and then right and then continue from there. 484 01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.350 huda: Okay. 485 01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:01.190 Jenn",
    "y Duan: Yeah, does that make like, how do you? How are you feeling about this? And do you have any thoughts on this. 486 01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.780 huda: Yeah, I think 487 01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.149 huda: I think I like this new like, I like this new take, I guess. 488 01:01:09.882 --> 01:01:14.870 huda: it might be a little difficult like trying to weave in like a different extracurricular 489 01:01:15.193 --> 01:01:20.790 huda: but I mean, I think I'll I'll try like, even if it doesn't look too smooth. I guess I could fix that later. But 490 01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:21.950 huda: yeah. 491 01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:43.700 Jenny Duan: And I think if you want to write about synthoria, that's also fine, because, like that is a game that you that you built so obviously, it's very relevant. So maybe you could write about the process of building synthoria, too, and like what it was like to like, use unity or what it was like to like. Design your own characters, because you also did all your character design, like that art process, is also really important, like 492 01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:59.210 Jenny Duan: how you coded like their decisions. And you simplified an ethical issue into like a series of if if then statements or like, you know, like computer logic, like, I think there's other ways that you can look at synthoria that are not just the ed tech aspect that are really valuable in the game. 493 01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.560 huda: Yeah. 494 01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.409 Jenny Duan: No, yeah. How does that feel to you? 495 01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:13.170 huda: Yeah, I think that's great. And I think I can highlight more about like how I went about storytelling through synthoria. 496 01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:15.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, right? 497 01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:25.329 Jenny Duan: Okay. When is the next time you want to meet? I'm actually going to la this weekend I won't be at Usc. But I'll be in La. But what time do you want to meet 498 01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.309 ",
    "Jenny Duan: so you can. 499 01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.670 huda: Are you still available on Sunday? 500 01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:33.040 Jenny Duan: Sunday. So 501 01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:37.100 Jenny Duan: it I cannot say for sure, because 502 01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:42.987 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna be driving. So the best times for me would probably be like Saturday night 503 01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:45.489 Jenny Duan: like later at night or 504 01:02:45.600 --> 01:03:01.409 Jenny Duan: Sunday. But and Sunday I might not be able to like. I'm gonna be on a car back, so I don't know how stable my Internet connection is. I don't want to bet on Sunday. So Monday or Monday might be nice, like Monday evening. I'm fully free, or Saturday evening 505 01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:02.939 Jenny Duan: would be good. 506 01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:10.379 huda: I think let's do Monday, then. Because yeah, I wanna get as many changes as possible. But before then. 507 01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:21.820 Jenny Duan: Then, if we have, if you end up making changes. In the meantime, if you just text me, I can like, look at stuff and give you comments asynchronously, too. And then same with your Ucsas uauc. 508 01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:26.159 Jenny Duan: I think it's just yeah. You see. Ucs, right? Anything else that's. 509 01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.750 huda: Those are like the main ones. And then 510 01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.899 huda: I mean, like, there's also like 511 01:03:32.401 --> 01:03:34.858 huda: This one Ronald Reagan scholarship. 512 01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:36.270 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay. 513 01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.049 huda: Yeah, I was. 514 01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.949 huda: I think I might start writing the essay soon, but I think the deadline is like. 515 01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.380 Jenny Duan: The deadline's what. 516 01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:50.079 huda: It's like later. So I have a little bit of time. 517 01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.139 Jenny Duan: Okay, there's also the Elk scholarship. Don't f",
    "orget about that. 518 01:03:54.718 --> 01:03:58.501 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. Let's meet on Monday, maybe. Let's say 519 01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:04.179 Jenny Duan: I don't know, like 7, 6, 30. I don't know what's a good time for you. 520 01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.559 huda: Yeah, 6, 30 is actually. 521 01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:14.379 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do that on Monday, and just send me stuff as you write it, and I can get feedback to you. Okay. 522 01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:17.499 Jenny Duan: alright, keep it up."

So maybe you can walk them through like your evolution of. 448 I guess. Here you kind of do that. But I think. 449 like you don't have to mention so many games.

And like 452 we need this story to feel a little bit continuous, because you're also talking about journalism. So you can see like in playing a certain character made you feel this way which helped you go in this direction.

I really liked what you wrote in 455 I think it was a stand for no, maybe in your in your main essay in your main essay about like how games or how building, like your naming your characters, how that was like 456 a method of getting empathy with your players.
