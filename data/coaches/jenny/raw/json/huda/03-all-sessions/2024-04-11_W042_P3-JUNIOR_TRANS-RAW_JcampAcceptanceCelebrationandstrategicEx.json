Can you hear me? 2 00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.759 Jenny Duan: Hi, yeah, I can hear you. How's it going. 3 00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.570 huda s: It's going well, how are you? 4 00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:48.841 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. I'm currently in Chindi right now, which is like a different Chinese city. 5 00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.470 Jenny Duan: I came here like this weekend just to see my family. So yeah. 6 00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.619 Jenny Duan: let's get started. I'm wondering if you can just give some quick updates just about how things are going generally, and then we can go into some specifics. 7 00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:10.460 huda s: Okay, yeah. So for empowering AI, we contacted a so we got like 8 00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:34.680 huda s: 2 people who filled out like an application to be like one of our board members. We're trying to like set up like more people. So that cause. So I don't have to rely on my vice president. And then eventually, I could just like face her out, because right now she's not really doing anything anyway. But yeah. So so I got like at least 2 people. They we've got a treasure. Who's gonna help us establish as a 9 00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:53.589 huda s: 5 one see nonprofits. So we can kind of like apply for more like recognition and stuff. So like there's that. And then we also have someone who's interested in being a secretary. So like, maybe that's the person that I'll use to like I guess. Like, replace my vice president. 10 00:07:53.957 --> 00:08:01.892 huda s: and then, yeah. So then I've got a few more people interested, but like, you know, they haven't found out the application yet. But 11 00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.718 huda s: yeah. So I think that's moving along pretty well. 12 00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.100 huda s: And then 13 00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:11.664 huda s: for folklift. 14 00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:34.880 huda s: Oh, yeah, I got. I got someone from like my school. They're like a sophomore. They're interested in like making social media posts for folklift and helping me out with that. So yeah, they made one. They made one about policy. But I feel like I'm gonna try and have them like, do more content, based around like other types of social activism cause. 15 00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:44.145 huda s: I feel like that's not really like the main point of folklift. It's kind of more to like empower like every social activist movement. So 16 00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.059 huda s: yeah, I guess I'll work on that a little bit more, and then 17 00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.669 huda s: hold on. Let me go in the doc. Maybe I can. See? 18 00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:19.659 huda s: Yeah. So I it's like, basically. 19 00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:29.784 huda s: I'm kind of, I'm not exactly done. But I wrote like kind of an essay for for the Bri Brian Cameron one the one about the location that's changed me. 20 00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.200 huda s: and then 21 00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:40.160 huda s: phone club so we haven't really done anything yet. But we're putting the trailer on the student news this week. 22 00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:48.768 huda s: I think. Oh, yeah. G, some decisions are coming out next Thursday or Friday, I think 23 00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.480 Jenny Duan: Okay. 24 00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.170 huda s: Later. 25 00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:56.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's exciting.

They know right now 196 00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.139 Jenny Duan: it doesn't come. No, say, say no for it right now. 197 00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.209 Jenny Duan: It doesn't conflict with jcf. 198 00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.230 Jenny Duan: so you could. There's no reason for you to disclose. 199 00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:12.470 huda s: Okay. 200 00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.869 Jenny Duan: Is they code of classy like Newsletter or something? 201 00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.930 huda s: I was through, and see what, so I can say. 202 00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:18.550 Jenny Duan: Oh! 203 00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.590 huda s: Maybe yeah. 204 00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.369 Jenny Duan: And see what not coded, classy. 205 00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.810 Jenny Duan: Sorry whenever I hear like Apple anything. I think Code is classy because they're such a big. 206 00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.710 huda s: Yeah. 207 00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:50.240 huda s: Oh, yeah, should you see like computer science, maybe. Or like, I could talk about AI ethics here, I think maybe then. 208 00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 209 00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.949 Jenny Duan: We make some notes on the document so that we have this. 210 00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.320 Jenny Duan: Okay. 211 00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:11.900 Jenny Duan: process, workshops experience. You can put like everything that you've done. 212 00:27:16.495 --> 00:27:17.040 huda s: Like 213 00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.869 huda s: is this in terms of like empowering AI and stuff for stuff that i've done to like, learn. 214 00:27:23.587 --> 00:27:30.539 Jenny Duan: I think both. Why don't you just submit a separate edge? Different cla category. So you can say like classes. 215 00:27:31.132 --> 00:27:32.420 Jenny Duan: You can see like 216 00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.030 Jenny Duan: service or projects. 217 00:27:35.975 --> 00:27:41.200 Jenny Duan: And that could include, like all the websites that you've built, and then you could also save, maybe, like 218 00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.409 Jenny Duan: other. And then you could put. 219 00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.670 Jenny Duan: If anything fits in the other category. 220 00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.020 huda s: If this is like an engineering camp like, maybe I can mention that one time I went to like a robotics like 221 00:27:52.895 --> 00:27:54.289 huda s: one day like 222 00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.609 huda s: competition. And we, I guess, yeah. 223 00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.600 Jenny Duan: You could definitely say that that seems good to me. 224 00:28:02.188 --> 00:28:09.429 Jenny Duan: And then what would you like to study in college? You can say, like computer science. You can say, game development. You could say, like. 225 00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.709 Jenny Duan: interactive journalism, something like that. 226 00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.680 Jenny Duan: yeah. 227 00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.830 Jenny Duan: yeah. 228 00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.510 Jenny Duan: And then you can say, you can turn this into a full sentence like, I want to study this because this. 229 00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:38.589 Jenny Duan: and also maybe for the purposes of this class camp, though, do you have to have an engineering focus because you could say computer engineering. 230 00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:43.290 huda s: Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like, instead of this, I'd probably focus more on. 231 00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.530 Jenny Duan: Engineering. 232 00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.050 Jenny Duan: yeah. 233 00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.270 Jenny Duan: hey? Creed. 234 00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.150 huda s: Just say, engineer, I think. 235 00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.199 huda s: I think if I talked a bit more about 236 00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:03.159 huda s: yeah, thanks, maybe because, like I feel like everyone's gonna be seeing engineering. Then. 237 00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.931 Jenny Duan: Oh, I would like to 238 00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:14.139 Jenny Duan: pursue engineering, maybe, and engineering ethics, or like with a focus on something else. 239 00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.739 Jenny Duan: This is like a really short answer. 240 00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:00.830 Jenny Duan: yeah. 241 00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.690 huda s: Yeah. 242 00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.199 huda s: really, for hands-on experiences. 243 00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.010 huda s: and 244 00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.270 huda s: the opportunity. 245 00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.289 huda s: It's a neat fellow. 246 00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.910 huda s: passionate engineers. 247 00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.590 Jenny Duan: Okay. 248 00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.339 huda s: That is not the same question. 249 00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.170 Jenny Duan: oh, no! What are you looking for? Like? Maybe you can say like you're looking for? 250 00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.339 Jenny Duan: I mean, like, also community, maybe of other. 251 00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.860 Jenny Duan: Is it all women in this camp. 252 00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.200 Jenny Duan: Doesn't say that. 253 00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.300 huda s: I think it's specifically from. 254 00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.819 huda s: For for first, for like, these people. 255 00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.550 huda s: boom, okay. 256 00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.279 huda s: actually, I think it's for all.

Maybe say, like, you don't really have much engineering experience. And you want an opportunity to learn more about that. 260 00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.899 huda s: Is this enough for I said. I would like to learn more and gain 261 00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.610 huda s: experience with engineering as a software developer. 262 00:32:18.206 --> 00:32:21.140 Jenny Duan: I think it should be more specific. So like 263 00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.610 Jenny Duan: learning more doesn't really tell you what you want to learn more about. So. 264 00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.280 huda s: Ruth. 265 00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:26.076 Jenny Duan: Say, like 266 00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.830 huda s: About hardware.

If you scroll up, it says like 324 00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:05.710 Jenny Duan: they're still accepting 2024 applications for those States, maybe that they haven't received applications from. 325 00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.420 huda s: Oh. 326 00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.039 huda s: so because there's. 327 00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.680 Jenny Duan: Accepting. 328 00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.130 huda s: Already. Just still. 329 00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.390 huda s: it's interesting. 330 00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.339 Jenny Duan: I guess so, since they're still. 331 00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.729 huda s: When are they? When are they? Gonna let us know? Then it's it's kind of late. 332 00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.390 Jenny Duan: I don't know. We could just wait for that. It's fine. 333 00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:29.619 Jenny Duan: but like, since they're still accepting applications like they probably won't let you know, until like at least after they click, stop accepting applications. 334 00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.590 huda s: Yeah. 335 00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.040 huda s: that's interesting. 336 00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.570 huda s: okay? And then 337 00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:41.770 huda s: I think we've heard back from irony. 338 00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.664 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So that's like, mostly it. 339 00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.200 Jenny Duan: I'm so happy about Jantha. That's actually. 340 00:36:49.665 --> 00:36:50.130 huda s: Yeah. 341 00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.223 Jenny Duan: it's a big win. It's like a big national win. 342 00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.530 Jenny Duan: yeah, super happy for you. 343 00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.290 Jenny Duan: okay. 344 00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.090 Jenny Duan: So we're submitting the apple one. Let's go over your Brian camera and impact like the essay that you. 345 00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.510 Jenny Duan: Worked on there. 346 00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:18.359 Jenny Duan: Oh, we actually have a couple of questions before we move to there. How's the woman in games, ambassadorship going. 347 00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:28.395 huda s: It's good. Well, I've been kind of kind of like interacting with like people in the community. And I've been asking questions on like how I can. So 348 00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:39.050 huda s: the ambassadorship program. We have to like run workshops and such, and I think it will be like valuable if I kind of held my first shop 349 00:37:39.050 --> 00:38:03.429 huda s: like with the help of another ambassador cause like right now. I'm just getting started, and also, like you know, be just nicer to work with someone. So I've been like kind of checking in and discord to see like if I wanna be interested. So I haven't found anyone yet. But I think I'll do a little more researching. And I wanna hold like a workshop like a virtual workshop for game development 350 00:38:04.198 --> 00:38:12.563 huda s: maybe for, like, just the area people, and I can try to gain some interest for that. But yeah, 351 00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:24.239 huda s: yeah. Other than that. I've been trying to like kind of promote a bit on Linkedin and Instagram. I think. I could be a little more aggressive with that, maybe. But yeah. 352 00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.339 Jenny Duan: What are the responsibilities of an ambassador? What do you have to do. 353 00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:46.549 huda s: So you have to. So like, I think you kind of have the requirements of like holding like once a specific event, and also just answering questions on the discord and like being active in, like the Linkedin Group group. So it's kind of more of like. 354 00:38:47.050 --> 00:39:05.400 huda s: like, I guess, kind of like a disc, or like moderator. Like, they just kind of have to be like involved with what everyone's doing. And yeah. And then you like. Obviously, you do have to run an event. But that one's like just annually. So you have to have one at least once a year. 355 00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.015 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 356 00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.209 Jenny Duan: I feel like when for the women in games, ambassadorship, position like 357 00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:19.350 Jenny Duan: you can put a lot of energy into it. But don't put too much energy like, try to focus on your own things too. 358 00:39:20.295 --> 00:39:21.070 huda s: Yeah. 359 00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Let me go into this document. 360 00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.860 Jenny Duan: I like this image that you've chosen. 361 00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:53.599 huda s: Thanks. Yeah, that's the that's like the exact, like the one I was gonna like, focus more on. So you know how I said so I guess the story was kind of different from what I remember. But like I, I searched into it like recently. And so currently, how it starts out, is like the the video game character is like working at this like monotonous and like 362 00:39:53.730 --> 00:40:13.539 huda s: super isolated town called like in the corporation is like it's like Jojimur or something, and but then she moves to like the rural town, and there's like no opportunities. But there's like lots of people and there's like 363 00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:38.479 huda s: like large land and everything. But then so she. So now she's like familiar with like this town, right? But then there's like this abandoned building, which is the image and so then she has, like a choice, for if she wants to turn it into like a community center, or if she wants to turn it into like an extension to Jujima, and which is like where she came from. So like, I wanna compare it to like how like kind of the. 364 00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.040 Jenny Duan: That's okay. 365 00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:39.920 huda s: That. 366 00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:52.369 huda s: Yeah, it's gonna we'll talk about how it helped me to like realize that. My rural town like started you valley was more important to me than like. I guess 367 00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:57.190 huda s: I don't wanna say more important to me than opportunities cause like I guess I kinda 368 00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:05.959 huda s: undermines like my point. But I guess like oh, I guess like making your own opportunities from like Startu Valley, I guess. 369 00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.085 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like, that's a really good lens. 370 00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:23.540 Jenny Duan: I think what you can do. I know, I think the second part of this doesn't quite make sense to me like the feeling moving to your new rural town. What can you explain this like from your old town to your new rural town. I'm kind of confused about what this means. 371 00:41:24.726 --> 00:41:40.090 huda s: Like my old town, was similar, I guess, like, in a way, it was like similar to the Jojo Mart, which was like, you know, isolated, and it's full of opportunities, but it's like isolated, like no collaboration, and just kind of monotonous. And then. 372 00:41:40.520 --> 00:42:01.300 huda s: like my new, my chat like the little town that I moved to. It had, like lots of people lacked opportunities. But, like, you know, it was like a different kind of life so like this. Like the the character moving from that city to the other city, reminded me of myself, who also moved from like like a monotonous 373 00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:08.769 huda s: like for really opportunity, bound like a location. It's like a small like middle of nowhere. Place 374 00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.999 huda s: so that's I guess what I was kinda trying to say 375 00:42:13.323 --> 00:42:23.989 huda s: and then I was. I was kind of just trying to work my way up to the part where it talks about the building cause, like the the building is like, kind of like the main focus of it. 376 00:42:24.288 --> 00:42:36.820 huda s: So that's why I had like the part where it said the character became one of the faces that started Valley and then that part. But that was just trying to like work up to the bill the choice of the building, I guess. 377 00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.699 Jenny Duan: Got it. I feel like what makes more sense to me is saying, how like 378 00:42:42.034 --> 00:42:55.949 Jenny Duan: I don't. I don't think the moving part makes sense in the context of your time. I know that it's a direct comparison, but I feel like, if we wanted to establish this background of like that. You're raised in sort of a rural town. I don't wanna make it seem like you move there. Really, recently. 379 00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.560 huda s: That makes sense. Yeah. 380 00:42:57.813 --> 00:43:12.779 Jenny Duan: Just like for like the opportunity and framing perspective. But I do think it's a really good idea to show that, like you're searching for new opportunities, and you're searching for how to make the best out of your background. And so, I think, bringing that aspect out more rather than the actual move is gonna be more powerful. 381 00:43:14.203 --> 00:43:14.780 huda s: Okay. 382 00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:21.840 Jenny Duan: But I think this is really a really good start so far. How many words is this? S. Is this essay? Total? 500. 383 00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.330 huda s: It's yeah, 520. 384 00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.290 Jenny Duan: How many words do you have left? And what are you gonna do with the rest of the words. 385 00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:44.190 huda s: I think I definitely didn't get enough like I didn't I? I didn't explain the this part. I think this is where I was describing the community center. So I'll definitely like explain. Like one on one hand, the character could have expanded Jojimur her old 386 00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:56.169 huda s: monotonous opportunity driving life. But, on the other hand, she could have built a center for a community and build opportunities for others. And I could kind of explain about how like 387 00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:02.451 huda s: maybe I can like even like, bring in like one of my extra curriculars, and talk about like 388 00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:11.385 huda s: like a time where I had to, I guess, choose community over like just like individual 389 00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.640 huda s: improvement. I guess. 390 00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.660 huda s: maybe 391 00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:28.350 huda s: I feel like I'm all already talked about like folklift or empowering AI, and like all of these. 392 00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.510 huda s: so like maybe 393 00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:44.639 huda s: I don't know. Do you think I should connect it to my extra curriculums or do you think it's fine? If I just use a second analogy. 394 00:44:45.577 --> 00:44:46.679 Jenny Duan: I feel like 395 00:44:47.120 --> 00:45:04.539 Jenny Duan: it's fine if you just use it as an analogy. But if you could talk about how you've like developed from your rural town. That'd be good like you can say this store owner maybe develop Xyc features, or they've expanded in these ways and like you've also pushed yourself to pursue opportunities like beyond the scope of what's normally expected. 396 00:45:05.386 --> 00:45:07.290 huda s: Okay, that makes sense 397 00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.750 huda s: bombed. 398 00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:19.480 huda s: Yeah, also, I had a, I had a, so in the Mhcsd, which is the community service. 399 00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:25.888 huda s: I think there's like a a way to get recognized. 400 00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.999 huda s: And I was wondering like. 401 00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.590 huda s: so there's a few things you could get recognized for, so you can. 402 00:45:43.087 --> 00:45:49.030 huda s: I can probably get a ceremonial resolution, a certificate of recognition or appreciation. 403 00:45:51.530 --> 00:46:06.539 huda s: And then I was wondering like which one I should like focus on like, should I focus on Nc, where, or empowering AI or focus like which one would be more impactful to like, get an award from the Mhcsd for I can like put like on the website, or something. 404 00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.350 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 405 00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.239 Jenny Duan: Let's see, are they giving you a new award. 406 00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:22.789 huda s: Yeah. So they just like, give you like a certification of like recognition. And like, maybe I don't know, like. 407 00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.779 huda s: have like a certificate, and like, take a picture and everything. 408 00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:28.710 Jenny Duan: Comparing, maybe like 409 00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:37.359 Jenny Duan: not Nc. Web, because you already have recognition for that. So either folklift or empowering AI. And then out of those 2. I think you can just choose one. 410 00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:45.019 huda s: I'm thinking, maybe a folklift. I feel like cause cause like. 411 00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.130 huda s: since that's more like 412 00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:55.620 huda s: locally based, especially with those small businesses and everything. Maybe that might be like more impactful from a picture that. 413 00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. 414 00:46:58.850 --> 00:46:59.530 huda s: Okay. 415 00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.480 huda s: sounds good. 416 00:47:04.218 --> 00:47:07.089 huda s: Yeah, that's for that. And then. 417 00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:12.249 huda s: yeah, here I I don't really write anything other than that. But. 418 00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:19.849 Jenny Duan: Okay. I think let's try to finish this next time, and then we'll we can review that after that. 419 00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.400 Jenny Duan: Cool. Any other questions before we wrap up for today? 420 00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.229 huda s: no, I I think that's all for today. 421 00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:38.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, then awesome congratulations again on Jcamp and we, are we not doing our session tomorrow? I saw your email. 422 00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:45.430 huda s: Yeah, no, sorry I was like, I'm we're actually going outside tomorrow. So I don't wanna miss this meeting. But yeah. 423 00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Then we'll reschedule. We'll just do our next week's meeting. Then. 424 00:47:51.077 --> 00:47:52.689 huda s: Sounds. Good bye. 425 00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:53.310 Jenny Duan: Papa.",

Can you hear me? 2 00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.759 Jenny Duan: Hi, yeah, I can hear you. How's it going. 3 00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.570 huda s: It's going well, how are you? 4 00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:48.841 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. I'm currently in Chindi right now, which is like a different Chinese city. 5 00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.470 Jenny Duan: I came here like this weekend just to see my family. So yeah. 6 00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.619 Jenny Duan: let's get started. I'm wondering if you can just give some quick updates just about how things are going generally, and then we can go into some specifics. 7 00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:10.460 huda s: Okay, yeah. So for empowering AI, we contacted a so we got like 8 00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:34.680 huda s: 2 people who filled out like an application to be like one of our board members. We're trying to like set up like more people. So that cause. So I don't have to rely on my vice president. And then eventually, I could just like face her out, because right now she's not really doing anything anyway. But yeah. So so I got like at least 2 people. They we've got a treasure. Who's gonna help us establish as a 9 00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:53.589 huda s: 5 one see nonprofits. So we can kind of like apply for more like recognition and stuff. So like there's that. And then we also have someone who's interested in being a secretary. So like, maybe that's the person that I'll use to like I guess. Like, replace my vice president. 10 00:07:53.957 --> 00:08:01.892 huda s: and then, yeah. So then I've got a few more people interested, but like, you know, they haven't found out the application yet. But 11 00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.718 huda s: yeah. So I think that's moving along pretty well. 12 00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.100 huda s: And then 13 00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:11.664 huda s: for folklift. 14 00:08:13",
    ".100 --> 00:08:34.880 huda s: Oh, yeah, I got. I got someone from like my school. They're like a sophomore. They're interested in like making social media posts for folklift and helping me out with that. So yeah, they made one. They made one about policy. But I feel like I'm gonna try and have them like, do more content, based around like other types of social activism cause. 15 00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:44.145 huda s: I feel like that's not really like the main point of folklift. It's kind of more to like empower like every social activist movement. So 16 00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.059 huda s: yeah, I guess I'll work on that a little bit more, and then 17 00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.669 huda s: hold on. Let me go in the doc. Maybe I can. See? 18 00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:19.659 huda s: Yeah. So I it's like, basically. 19 00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:29.784 huda s: I'm kind of, I'm not exactly done. But I wrote like kind of an essay for for the Bri Brian Cameron one the one about the location that's changed me. 20 00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.200 huda s: and then 21 00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:40.160 huda s: phone club so we haven't really done anything yet. But we're putting the trailer on the student news this week. 22 00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:48.768 huda s: I think. Oh, yeah. G, some decisions are coming out next Thursday or Friday, I think 23 00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.480 Jenny Duan: Okay. 24 00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.170 huda s: Later. 25 00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:56.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's exciting. I heard about the wait list for the games program. 26 00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.709 Jenny Duan: Let's send them an update. Do they give you a form for that? 27 00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:08.808 huda s: They just have, like like a form where it said, if you're interested in wait list, you have to fill this out, and then it's just like a yes or no, like 28 00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:15.829 huda s: bubbling. And then I tried. I submitted like the day of, because, like I don't want to do it too late",
    ". 29 00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.460 Jenny Duan: Okay. 30 00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.760 Jenny Duan: okay, can you? 31 00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:32.069 Jenny Duan: Do you know, if you could share your screen for that email? Because if it's an email that you could respond to then like we should send them an email. 32 00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.210 huda s: Oh. 33 00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.550 huda s: I got. I got selected to be in J. Camp. I just got the email. 34 00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:47.899 Jenny Duan: Oh, oh, that wait! Oh, my God! Wait! Congratulations! Wait!

You can put like everything that you've done. 212 00:27:16.495 --> 00:27:17.040 huda s: Like 213 00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.869 huda s: is this in terms of like empowering AI and stuff for stuff that i've done to like, learn. 214 00:27:23.587 --> 00:27:30.539 Jenny Duan: I think both. Why don't you just submit a separate edge? Different cla category. So you can say like classes. 215 00:27:31.132 --> 00:27:32.420 Jenny Duan: You can see like 216 00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.030 Jenny Duan: service or projects. 217 00:27:35.975 --> 00:27:41.200 Jen",
    "ny Duan: And that could include, like all the websites that you've built, and then you could also save, maybe, like 218 00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.409 Jenny Duan: other. And then you could put. 219 00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.670 Jenny Duan: If anything fits in the other category. 220 00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.020 huda s: If this is like an engineering camp like, maybe I can mention that one time I went to like a robotics like 221 00:27:52.895 --> 00:27:54.289 huda s: one day like 222 00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.609 huda s: competition. And we, I guess, yeah. 223 00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.600 Jenny Duan: You could definitely say that that seems good to me. 224 00:28:02.188 --> 00:28:09.429 Jenny Duan: And then what would you like to study in college? You can say, like computer science. You can say, game development. You could say, like. 225 00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.709 Jenny Duan: interactive journalism, something like that. 226 00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.680 Jenny Duan: yeah. 227 00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.830 Jenny Duan: yeah. 228 00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.510 Jenny Duan: And then you can say, you can turn this into a full sentence like, I want to study this because this. 229 00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:38.589 Jenny Duan: and also maybe for the purposes of this class camp, though, do you have to have an engineering focus because you could say computer engineering. 230 00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:43.290 huda s: Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like, instead of this, I'd probably focus more on. 231 00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.530 Jenny Duan: Engineering. 232 00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.050 Jenny Duan: yeah. 233 00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.270 Jenny Duan: hey? Creed. 234 00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.150 huda s: Just say, engineer, I think. 235 00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.199 huda s: I think if I talked a bit more about 236 00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:03.159 huda s: yeah, thanks, maybe because, like I feel like everyone's gonna be seeing engineering. Then. 237 00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.931 Jenny Du",
    "an: Oh, I would like to 238 00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:14.139 Jenny Duan: pursue engineering, maybe, and engineering ethics, or like with a focus on something else. 239 00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.739 Jenny Duan: This is like a really short answer. 240 00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:00.830 Jenny Duan: yeah. 241 00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.690 huda s: Yeah. 242 00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.199 huda s: really, for hands-on experiences. 243 00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.010 huda s: and 244 00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.270 huda s: the opportunity. 245 00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.289 huda s: It's a neat fellow. 246 00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.910 huda s: passionate engineers. 247 00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.590 Jenny Duan: Okay. 248 00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.339 huda s: That is not the same question. 249 00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.170 Jenny Duan: oh, no! What are you looking for? Like? Maybe you can say like you're looking for? 250 00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.339 Jenny Duan: I mean, like, also community, maybe of other. 251 00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.860 Jenny Duan: Is it all women in this camp. 252 00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.200 Jenny Duan: Doesn't say that. 253 00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.300 huda s: I think it's specifically from. 254 00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.819 huda s: For for first, for like, these people. 255 00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.550 huda s: boom, okay. 256 00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.279 huda s: actually, I think it's for all. But like these people are recommended or like 257 00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.360 huda s: select it, but I don't think it's for women only. 258 00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:22.890 Jenny Duan: Okay. 259 00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:32.649 Jenny Duan: And then why do you want to participate? Maybe say, like, you don't really have much engineering experience. And you want an opportunity to learn more about that. 260 00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.899 huda s: Is this enough for I said. I would like to learn more and gain 261 00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.610 huda s: experience with engineering as a so",
    "ftware developer. 262 00:32:18.206 --> 00:32:21.140 Jenny Duan: I think it should be more specific. So like 263 00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.610 Jenny Duan: learning more doesn't really tell you what you want to learn more about. So. 264 00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.280 huda s: Ruth. 265 00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:26.076 Jenny Duan: Say, like 266 00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.830 huda s: About hardware. Maybe. 267 00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.600 Jenny Duan: Is this a focus on hardware. 268 00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.320 huda s: I. It doesn't give too many details to be honest. 269 00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.840 Jenny Duan: Dave. 270 00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.349 Jenny Duan: you scroll down? 271 00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.269 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe we can say, like. 272 00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:59.070 Jenny Duan: you want to learn more about the intersection of computer science and engineering. 273 00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.226 huda s: Okay, yeah. 274 00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.780 huda s: Gain experience. 275 00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:26.830 huda s: bone. 276 00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.200 Jenny Duan: Building, Standalone Project. 277 00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.790 huda s: Building. 278 00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:38.990 Jenny Duan: Don't. You don't necessarily need to say as a software developer, I feel like I'm not exactly sure what this kid will prepare you to do. So, maybe software developers have the right role. 279 00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.880 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 280 00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.730 huda s: I love game 281 00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.280 huda s: developing 282 00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.670 huda s: from developers, from. 283 00:33:58.125 --> 00:33:59.180 huda s: Riding 284 00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.960 huda s: bone. 285 00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:04.070 huda s: writing articles. 286 00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:09.870 huda s: for 287 00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.800 huda s: journals 288 00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:14.529 huda s: and 289 00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.539 huda s: and for making. 290 00:3",

I don't think it's not a scam. This is seems very legit. 295 00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.370 huda s: Yeah, I was kind of. I was kind of confused like. 296 00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:47.309 huda s: cause the application doesn't seem too tough. So. 297 00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:48.590 Jenny Duan: Super short. 298 00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.449 huda s: Yeah. 299 00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:56.009 Jenny Duan: Maybe they're like auto accepting people that they've sent it to like that would be really. 300 00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.010 huda s: Yeah, it. 301 00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.170 Jenny Duan: It did that. 302 00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.080 huda s: I hope so. 303 00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.204 Jenny Duan: This is a really good opportunity for you. 304 00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.509 Jenny Duan: it doesn't conflict with any with Jc. Camp, either. So that's good. 305 00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:07.780 huda s: Yeah, cool. 306 00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.590 Jenny Duan: So what else are we waiting to hear back about Gstem while we waiting. 307 00:35:12.205 --> 00:35:15.279 huda s: All new cars. I think. 308 00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.880 Jenny Duan: What part. 309 00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:20.819 huda s: New Parth. The other Journalism Conference. 310 00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.120 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When did. 311 00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:23.490 huda s: Yeah. 312 00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:24.659 Jenny Duan: Messages with that. 313 00:35:25.477 --> 00:35:28.970 huda s: I don't think they put on their site. I'll check it. 314 00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.763 Jenny Duan: Oh, that 315 00:35:31.610 --",
    "> 00:35:35.179 Jenny Duan: coat of coffee! But that's like pretty much guaranteed I feel 316 00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:37.730 Jenny Duan: What else. 317 00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.310 huda s: Hmm. 318 00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.769 huda s: I didn't get any updates about it. 319 00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.290 huda s: So. 320 00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:54.469 Jenny Duan: I think they're still up like accepting applications. So. 321 00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.990 huda s: Oh, okay. 322 00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.610 huda s: but. 323 00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.659 Jenny Duan: If you wait. If you scroll up, it says like 324 00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:05.710 Jenny Duan: they're still accepting 2024 applications for those States, maybe that they haven't received applications from. 325 00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.420 huda s: Oh. 326 00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.039 huda s: so because there's. 327 00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.680 Jenny Duan: Accepting. 328 00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.130 huda s: Already. Just still. 329 00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.390 huda s: it's interesting. 330 00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.339 Jenny Duan: I guess so, since they're still. 331 00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.729 huda s: When are they? When are they? Gonna let us know? Then it's it's kind of late. 332 00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.390 Jenny Duan: I don't know. We could just wait for that. It's fine. 333 00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:29.619 Jenny Duan: but like, since they're still accepting applications like they probably won't let you know, until like at least after they click, stop accepting applications. 334 00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.590 huda s: Yeah. 335 00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.040 huda s: that's interesting. 336 00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.570 huda s: okay? And then 337 00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:41.770 huda s: I think we've heard back from irony. 338 00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.664 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So that's like, mostly it. 339 00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.200 Jenny Duan: I'm so happy about Jantha. That's actually. 340 00:36:49.665 --> 00:36",
    ":50.130 huda s: Yeah. 341 00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.223 Jenny Duan: it's a big win. It's like a big national win. 342 00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.530 Jenny Duan: yeah, super happy for you. 343 00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.290 Jenny Duan: okay. 344 00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.090 Jenny Duan: So we're submitting the apple one. Let's go over your Brian camera and impact like the essay that you. 345 00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.510 Jenny Duan: Worked on there. 346 00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:18.359 Jenny Duan: Oh, we actually have a couple of questions before we move to there. How's the woman in games, ambassadorship going. 347 00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:28.395 huda s: It's good. Well, I've been kind of kind of like interacting with like people in the community. And I've been asking questions on like how I can. So 348 00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:39.050 huda s: the ambassadorship program. We have to like run workshops and such, and I think it will be like valuable if I kind of held my first shop 349 00:37:39.050 --> 00:38:03.429 huda s: like with the help of another ambassador cause like right now. I'm just getting started, and also, like you know, be just nicer to work with someone. So I've been like kind of checking in and discord to see like if I wanna be interested. So I haven't found anyone yet. But I think I'll do a little more researching. And I wanna hold like a workshop like a virtual workshop for game development 350 00:38:04.198 --> 00:38:12.563 huda s: maybe for, like, just the area people, and I can try to gain some interest for that. But yeah, 351 00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:24.239 huda s: yeah. Other than that. I've been trying to like kind of promote a bit on Linkedin and Instagram. I think. I could be a little more aggressive with that, maybe. But yeah. 352 00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.339 Jenny Duan: What are the responsibilities of an ambassador? What do you have to do. 353 00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:46.549 huda s: So you have to. So like, I think you kind of have the requirements of lik",
    "e holding like once a specific event, and also just answering questions on the discord and like being active in, like the Linkedin Group group. So it's kind of more of like. 354 00:38:47.050 --> 00:39:05.400 huda s: like, I guess, kind of like a disc, or like moderator. Like, they just kind of have to be like involved with what everyone's doing. And yeah. And then you like. Obviously, you do have to run an event. But that one's like just annually. So you have to have one at least once a year. 355 00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.015 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 356 00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.209 Jenny Duan: I feel like when for the women in games, ambassadorship, position like 357 00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:19.350 Jenny Duan: you can put a lot of energy into it. But don't put too much energy like, try to focus on your own things too. 358 00:39:20.295 --> 00:39:21.070 huda s: Yeah. 359 00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Let me go into this document. 360 00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.860 Jenny Duan: I like this image that you've chosen. 361 00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:53.599 huda s: Thanks. Yeah, that's the that's like the exact, like the one I was gonna like, focus more on. So you know how I said so I guess the story was kind of different from what I remember. But like I, I searched into it like recently. And so currently, how it starts out, is like the the video game character is like working at this like monotonous and like 362 00:39:53.730 --> 00:40:13.539 huda s: super isolated town called like in the corporation is like it's like Jojimur or something, and but then she moves to like the rural town, and there's like no opportunities. But there's like lots of people and there's like 363 00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:38.479 huda s: like large land and everything. But then so she. So now she's like familiar with like this town, right? But then there's like this abandoned building, which is the image and so then she has, like a choice, for if she wants to turn it into like a community",
    " center, or if she wants to turn it into like an extension to Jujima, and which is like where she came from. So like, I wanna compare it to like how like kind of the. 364 00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.040 Jenny Duan: That's okay. 365 00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:39.920 huda s: That. 366 00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:52.369 huda s: Yeah, it's gonna we'll talk about how it helped me to like realize that. My rural town like started you valley was more important to me than like. I guess 367 00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:57.190 huda s: I don't wanna say more important to me than opportunities cause like I guess I kinda 368 00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:05.959 huda s: undermines like my point. But I guess like oh, I guess like making your own opportunities from like Startu Valley, I guess. 369 00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.085 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like, that's a really good lens. 370 00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:23.540 Jenny Duan: I think what you can do. I know, I think the second part of this doesn't quite make sense to me like the feeling moving to your new rural town. What can you explain this like from your old town to your new rural town. I'm kind of confused about what this means. 371 00:41:24.726 --> 00:41:40.090 huda s: Like my old town, was similar, I guess, like, in a way, it was like similar to the Jojo Mart, which was like, you know, isolated, and it's full of opportunities, but it's like isolated, like no collaboration, and just kind of monotonous. And then. 372 00:41:40.520 --> 00:42:01.300 huda s: like my new, my chat like the little town that I moved to. It had, like lots of people lacked opportunities. But, like, you know, it was like a different kind of life so like this. Like the the character moving from that city to the other city, reminded me of myself, who also moved from like like a monotonous 373 00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:08.769 huda s: like for really opportunity, bound like a location. It's like a small like middle of nowhere. Place 374 00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.999 huda s: so that's",
    " I guess what I was kinda trying to say 375 00:42:13.323 --> 00:42:23.989 huda s: and then I was. I was kind of just trying to work my way up to the part where it talks about the building cause, like the the building is like, kind of like the main focus of it. 376 00:42:24.288 --> 00:42:36.820 huda s: So that's why I had like the part where it said the character became one of the faces that started Valley and then that part. But that was just trying to like work up to the bill the choice of the building, I guess. 377 00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.699 Jenny Duan: Got it. I feel like what makes more sense to me is saying, how like 378 00:42:42.034 --> 00:42:55.949 Jenny Duan: I don't. I don't think the moving part makes sense in the context of your time. I know that it's a direct comparison, but I feel like, if we wanted to establish this background of like that. You're raised in sort of a rural town. I don't wanna make it seem like you move there. Really, recently. 379 00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.560 huda s: That makes sense. Yeah. 380 00:42:57.813 --> 00:43:12.779 Jenny Duan: Just like for like the opportunity and framing perspective. But I do think it's a really good idea to show that, like you're searching for new opportunities, and you're searching for how to make the best out of your background. And so, I think, bringing that aspect out more rather than the actual move is gonna be more powerful. 381 00:43:14.203 --> 00:43:14.780 huda s: Okay. 382 00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:21.840 Jenny Duan: But I think this is really a really good start so far. How many words is this? S. Is this essay? Total? 500. 383 00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.330 huda s: It's yeah, 520. 384 00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.290 Jenny Duan: How many words do you have left? And what are you gonna do with the rest of the words. 385 00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:44.190 huda s: I think I definitely didn't get enough like I didn't I? I didn't explain the this part. I think this is where I was describing the community center",
    ". So I'll definitely like explain. Like one on one hand, the character could have expanded Jojimur her old 386 00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:56.169 huda s: monotonous opportunity driving life. But, on the other hand, she could have built a center for a community and build opportunities for others. And I could kind of explain about how like 387 00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:02.451 huda s: maybe I can like even like, bring in like one of my extra curriculars, and talk about like 388 00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:11.385 huda s: like a time where I had to, I guess, choose community over like just like individual 389 00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.640 huda s: improvement. I guess. 390 00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.660 huda s: maybe 391 00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:28.350 huda s: I feel like I'm all already talked about like folklift or empowering AI, and like all of these. 392 00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.510 huda s: so like maybe 393 00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:44.639 huda s: I don't know. Do you think I should connect it to my extra curriculums or do you think it's fine? If I just use a second analogy. 394 00:44:45.577 --> 00:44:46.679 Jenny Duan: I feel like 395 00:44:47.120 --> 00:45:04.539 Jenny Duan: it's fine if you just use it as an analogy. But if you could talk about how you've like developed from your rural town. That'd be good like you can say this store owner maybe develop Xyc features, or they've expanded in these ways and like you've also pushed yourself to pursue opportunities like beyond the scope of what's normally expected. 396 00:45:05.386 --> 00:45:07.290 huda s: Okay, that makes sense 397 00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.750 huda s: bombed. 398 00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:19.480 huda s: Yeah, also, I had a, I had a, so in the Mhcsd, which is the community service. 399 00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:25.888 huda s: I think there's like a a way to get recognized. 400 00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.999 huda s: And I was wondering like. 401 00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.590 huda s: so there's a few things you could get recogn",
    "ized for, so you can. 402 00:45:43.087 --> 00:45:49.030 huda s: I can probably get a ceremonial resolution, a certificate of recognition or appreciation. 403 00:45:51.530 --> 00:46:06.539 huda s: And then I was wondering like which one I should like focus on like, should I focus on Nc, where, or empowering AI or focus like which one would be more impactful to like, get an award from the Mhcsd for I can like put like on the website, or something. 404 00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.350 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 405 00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.239 Jenny Duan: Let's see, are they giving you a new award. 406 00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:22.789 huda s: Yeah. So they just like, give you like a certification of like recognition. And like, maybe I don't know, like. 407 00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.779 huda s: have like a certificate, and like, take a picture and everything. 408 00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:28.710 Jenny Duan: Comparing, maybe like 409 00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:37.359 Jenny Duan: not Nc. Web, because you already have recognition for that. So either folklift or empowering AI. And then out of those 2. I think you can just choose one. 410 00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:45.019 huda s: I'm thinking, maybe a folklift. I feel like cause cause like. 411 00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.130 huda s: since that's more like 412 00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:55.620 huda s: locally based, especially with those small businesses and everything. Maybe that might be like more impactful from a picture that. 413 00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. 414 00:46:58.850 --> 00:46:59.530 huda s: Okay. 415 00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.480 huda s: sounds good. 416 00:47:04.218 --> 00:47:07.089 huda s: Yeah, that's for that. And then. 417 00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:12.249 huda s: yeah, here I I don't really write anything other than that. But. 418 00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:19.849 Jenny Duan: Okay. I think let's try to finish this next time, and then we'll we can review that after that. 419 00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.400 Jenny ",
    "Duan: Cool. Any other questions before we wrap up for today? 420 00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.229 huda s: no, I I think that's all for today. 421 00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:38.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, then awesome congratulations again on Jcamp and we, are we not doing our session tomorrow? I saw your email. 422 00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:45.430 huda s: Yeah, no, sorry I was like, I'm we're actually going outside tomorrow. So I don't wanna miss this meeting. But yeah. 423 00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Then we'll reschedule. We'll just do our next week's meeting. Then. 424 00:47:51.077 --> 00:47:52.689 huda s: Sounds. Good bye. 425 00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:53.310 Jenny Duan: Papa."
