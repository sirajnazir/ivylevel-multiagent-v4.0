How's it going? 3 00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.800 huda: It's going well, sorry. I was a bit late. I was. 4 00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.859 Jenny Duan: Give me 1 s to move to my desk. How's your week been? 5 00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:17.470 huda: It's been kind of like stressful, obviously, for the finals. I think I've updated on that. But yeah, like, it was a lot of studying this weekend. How did that go? 6 00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:30.349 huda: So like for a push, I actually got like a hundred percent on the final. So oh, my gosh! Wait congratulations! So you locked in the A wow! So did you study really hard for it, or like 7 00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.609 Jenny Duan: how like what I guess. What was your thought process there? 8 00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:44.770 huda: I think one like the the, you know, is definitely like a lot more like interesting to understand. And what unit was this? A unit? 6. 9 00:02:45.420 --> 00:03:06.529 huda: Which which one is that it was like kind of about like monopolies, and like like after the Civil war. I think. Yeah, it was pretty interesting. And I also tried like studying differently. So like, I would just like we take my notes before the test, and I think that really helped me. 10 00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.200 Jenny Duan: That's so awesome. Yea. 11 00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.280 congratulations! How did your other finals go? 12 00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:26.690 huda: So those are coming next week, or like tomorrow, or like, yeah, next week. So like, the thing I've been most worried about is calculus, cause it's like definitely harder. And like 13 00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.649 huda: yes, I think I think if I try could be able to do it. But it's just still something I have to study a lot for yeah. 14 00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.320 Jenny Duan: Gotcha 15 00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.539 Jenny Duan: And when is their calcf final? 16 00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.479 huda: It's on Wednesday. 17 00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.430 Jenny Duan: Gotcha, and is that your last day of school? 18 00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.979 huda: No, it's on Friday or last day school. 19 00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.079 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh, I can't believe you have school until Friday. That's 20 00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.170 Jenny Duan: wow. okay, cool. So 21 00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.240 Jenny Duan: if we can just start with like going through. 22 00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.939 Jenny Duan: Some of your updates. So beyond finals, do you have anything else new in? 23 00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.320 Jenny Duan: It happened this week? Let's start with maybe like folklift. How's that going? 24 00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:26.300 huda: I think I made some progress. So I've actually. So I know I've posted it on like linkedin. So I did get a lot of leads from there. Have you followed up with any of those? And have you able to contact contact those people? 25 00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:48.639 huda: Yeah, so like I had like like I'd say, like 16 applicants. And I just like I message them all like, Oh, this is A student led initiative. And I told them like a little bit more about about it. And then they're like asking like, Oh, what are the requirements? And so basically, I give the rundown. And so 2 of them are 26 00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.489 huda: already like starting to make their advertisements so and like, one of them's like for or both of them. 27 00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.089 huda: our college students. One of them is from like India, and then the other ones from New York. I think. 28 00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.799 Jenny Duan: Awesome. And then. So are there any other people that you are following up with beyond those 29 00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.329 Jenny Duan: 2 people? 30 00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:20.060 huda: Yeah, I'm a waiting reply, like I messaged him back yesterday, but there's someone with like there's like so like at least 31 00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.490 huda: like 32 00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.240 huda: I'd say 7 more people that I followed up with. But I'm just waiting there on the response. 33 00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.200 Jenny Duan: Okay. would you send like, follow up messages with them to them. 34 00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:58.320 huda: Yeah. Like, I message them like when they applied like I message them. And then they replied, and then I just gave them like more details on like specifics on how they can get started. And then? Yeah. So I was working on updating the website. So that so that, like, I'd be able to post it from like the different locations and the different minorities. So I've been kind of busy with like updating the website as well. 35 00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.979 Jenny Duan: can you screen share your new website so I can see it? 36 00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.600 huda: It's kind of like filled with bugs right now. So okay, maybe after you finish updating that, then. 37 00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.239 Jenny Duan: awesome. Okay, cool. How's empowering a, I 38 00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.909 huda: yeah. So 39 00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:46.080 huda: So the speaker that we were gonna have, she said she wasn't available until like end of January, and I don't know why she didn't re like. Tell me that before. But I said, that's fine cause. Then we have like more time to gain attraction. So so also, for, like regarding the boot camp, I think it's really hard to find, like, gather like a certain time where a bunch of people are interested in everything. So we're wondering if we could just make like 40 00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:58.560 huda: really interactive, like courses like rather than like classes or like webinars cause I feel like courses which have like interactible like 41 00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:05.189 huda: projects. I think that would be really good. And it'd be like more easier to reach more people. 42 00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:15.449 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Do you have a plan for like making those courses? Where do you have to publish them? And how do you hope to do that. 43 00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.990 huda: I think we might try we might try putting it on our website that we already have so I think. 44 00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:36.810 huda: during winter break me, and my friend can like so we already made the slides right, so we can kind of go through that. But then I was thinking, like with a website, we can probably code it so that we have like a like a like. 45 00:07:36.810 --> 00:08:06.150 huda: like the code, like inside of the website. So then they could do it. Like as they're watching the video. So I probably be able to like program that into the website. And then, yeah, like, I think I wanna make it more interactive. Cause. Then it's just like a a random Youtube video. So like, yeah, I think that's a good way, and then on top of that I think we can easily build from that, then cause if we do end up doing more boot camps, then like, it'll definitely be easier to scale. Yeah. 46 00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:17.130 Jenny Duan: this sounds like a lot of work. So how are you going to make sure that people see this, because I think, like the biggest thing is just how many people you can get to like, notice your work and get involved with it. 47 00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:37.030 huda: Yeah, so I think I started posting like on social media for empowering AI like I started yesterday. But I think my friend has been like making like carousels for our Instagram page. But I've noticed those don't do really. Well, so I think we're gonna definitely like ramp up on like reels. 48 00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:49.220 huda: And I think, like word of mouth as well, and I think Linkedin is going well for me, and like it's helped me with Cynthoria and folklift. So I think that might be one way to get like 49 00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.879 huda: attract, like people that might want to learn more. About empowering. AI, 50 00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.389 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm wondering how we can get you on like a feature something like. 51 00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:09.890 Jenny Duan: let me see, like 4, 6 young people who are changing the world like something like a feature like this would be really cool. To get you in an article. 52 00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:24.390 Jenny Duan: Oh, my, gosh. sorry, I have to pause my ad blocker. I'll show you this. but I think like things like this are really cool. I wanna figure out how to get you on something like this 53 00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:30.360 Jenny Duan: like this is someone I know who's in my great Armida at Stanford. She founded like 54 00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.380 Jenny Duan: let's see, empower Econ like virtual 3 day 55 00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.590 Jenny Duan: entreprene financial literacy camps for 56 00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:46.590 Jenny Duan: that have over 300 teens. So this is basically something you could do with empowering a, I like, you could basically do like. 57 00:09:47.110 --> 00:10:01.750 Jenny Duan: I think, the same thing. And like it links to it in Instagram Page. This is empower Econ, like, I think. if you can build a platform like this with like a lot of followers. I think that will be like impactful enough to get you in forbes magazine. 58 00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.480 Jenny Duan: like, I think what she's doing is not intrinsically different from yours, it's 59 00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:23.150 Jenny Duan: more just like good marketing. So I think that maybe you should like try to get someone to join your team who's really good at doing marketing or that's something you can try to learn, because I think it's just like a big skill to like, do graphics like this and get people interested in your work. 60 00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.170 huda: Sure. Yeah. 61 00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.800 Jenny Duan: So I'm going to just put this 62 00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:39.089 Jenny Duan: in here. Obviously, this is not for comparison. This is only for inspiration, like you shouldn't compare yourself to any of these people. This is another Stanford freshman. Right now. 63 00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:47.390 Jenny Duan: yeah, this is not like for comparison. This is more just for inspiration. So I think. Oh, maybe 64 00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.970 Jenny Duan: I wonder if you can. 65 00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.239 Jenny Duan: I wonder if you can pitch yourself to her? But I wonder how these people 66 00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.880 Jenny Duan: I wonder how these people they got their stuff featured. 67 00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:12.369 Jenny Duan: Maybe they just post a law on Linkedin cause she is obviously on Linkedin. And she obviously went to Stanford, too. This would be a good person to actually disconnect with. 68 00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.040 Jenny Duan: I think you should reach out to her and like, talk to her about what you're doing 69 00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.320 huda: yeah, for sure. Yeah. 70 00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:25.120 Jenny Duan: let me just put her linkedin here. She seems like an important person to know, because she also like I said, I went to Stanford. 71 00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:36.200 Jenny Duan: Obviously she has a lot of influence in like writing for Forbes. So if you can connect with her, maybe she can get you a feature somewhere that would be cool. 72 00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:46.650 Jenny Duan: Anyways, that's sort of another tangent that I think you should have just replied, for is this, it's called distinguished young woman. I don't know if you heard about this. 73 00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.840 Jenny Duan: It's just an award. 74 00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.249 Jenny Duan: It's not exactly a pageant, but it's like 75 00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.029 Jenny Duan: it's kind of 76 00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:02.299 Jenny Duan: like a pageant, but I think you should apply for it, because it's like a prestigious award that 77 00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.529 Jenny Duan: recognizes like powerful women in 78 00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:13.950 Jenny Duan: like all different states, it's a National Scholarship Program for High School girls. anyways. 79 00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.360 huda: I think this is something you should. I think you should apply for. 80 00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.619 Jenny Duan: I'm just going to put that 81 00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.580 Jenny Duan: here like the application. This form it takes like 5 s like it's it's just your name, your address. 82 00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.780 Jenny Duan: that you've never been married or pregnant. 83 00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:42.220 Jenny Duan: Which I think you fit like all those criterias, I think you should just apply for this. 84 00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.790 Jenny Duan: cool. 85 00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:51.030 Jenny Duan: anyways, those tangents aside. How's the film going? Any progress on that, or are you pausing it over? Break? 86 00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:58.930 huda: Oh, yeah. So we're like pausing over. Break yeah. Like, as I said, we need like to get the props and 87 00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.330 huda: everything. Yeah. 88 00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.450 Jenny Duan: okay. 89 00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:10.719 Jenny Duan: I'm curious. If you were planning to do any hackathons this year and is that something that you've thought about at all. 90 00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.839 huda: So I was thinking of going to cruise hacks. Exactly. Santa Cruz. 91 00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:39.300 huda: Oh, cool. Yeah, I want their last year. But it was like, mainly like majority, like college students participating. And I don't think any like high schoolers got the awards. So that's kinda like it was kinda off putting. So I was, I was kinda like thinking of not going to cruise access here. But yeah. 92 00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.430 Jenny Duan: hmm. 93 00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.070 Jenny Duan: yeah, that makes sense. 94 00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.269 Jenny Duan: Are there any like? I think there's are there any Bay area hackathons you could go to because I feel like 95 00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.260 Jenny Duan: there are 96 00:13:53.110 --> 00:14:03.780 Jenny Duan: a lot. So let me just do a search cause. I think right now what I'm trying to do for you. I think it would be good to like stack some awards on your portfolio like, I just think that that would be 97 00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:13.590 Jenny Duan: effective for you. One award. That I think would be pretty cool is Ml, H. Like top 50? That's just like 98 00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.279 Jenny Duan: an award for you to 99 00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:30.539 Jenny Duan: get if you just do a lot of hackathons like this person. 1718 18 etc. So I think it would be cool for you to apply for just and just doing like a lot of 100 00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.720 Jenny Duan: hackathons. 101 00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.419 Jenny Duan: So this one's in Sunnyvale. That's like is that pretty close to where you are? 102 00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.480 huda: It's about like an hour and a half. Yeah. 103 00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.700 Jenny Duan: Think this would be 104 00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.120 Jenny Duan: pretty cool. I'm just gonna put like a hackathon 105 00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:58.860 Jenny Duan: track hackathons here, because I think hackathons are like a really good award to have in your portfolio, especially if you're applying for game dev or computer science degrees. I think 106 00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:12.919 Jenny Duan: you know, cause hackathons have a lot of winners. Obviously, cause there's multiple categories. It's a pretty good opportunity, I think, for you to win an award. So I'm just gonna put that there and then. 107 00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:19.130 huda: I think I've actually participated in I saw like hijacks. 108 00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.060 Jenny Duan: I've learned before. Yeah. 109 00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.999 Jenny Duan: hydrax is that happening again this year? 110 00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.160 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 111 00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.100 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 112 00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.100 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's happening. So I'm just going to put that there. 113 00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:41.840 Jenny Duan: Hydra hacks. Mateo hacks would be good. It's like San Mateo High School. 114 00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.630 Jenny Duan: and 115 00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:55.460 Jenny Duan: any high School middle school think this would be good material hacks. And you should. Do. You know people who like in your local area, who you could be on team with for these types of things. 116 00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:12.049 huda: See? That's kind of my issue with hackathons because I took my like friends who are in the Cs pathway for my school to the cruise hex but I found it was a kind of a struggle, cause they didn't really know how to code and and like 117 00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:18.379 huda: I was kind of up all night kind of working on it. But they didn't really like know how to code those 118 00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.600 huda: kind of one of the reasons. Yeah. 119 00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.690 Jenny Duan: is there, are there anyone that you know who's 120 00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:32.200 Jenny Duan: I guess you good at coding that you think you could be on a team with? 121 00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:58.660 huda: Yeah, like, I've tried asking like people outside of different groups, like some guys from like the Hackathon Club and everything but they kind of they take like the information, like, I asked someone if we could join, do the Congressional app challenge together. And he like. That's how he found out about the Congressional App challenge, and he joined it with someone else. So yeah, like, I think I can. I can probably try reaching out to more people and like, see 122 00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.710 huda: if there's anyone else that can I go that I can work with? Yeah. 123 00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:17.099 Jenny Duan: I wonder if there's just anyone like in the I mean, it doesn't have to be at your school like just in the Bay Area. In general, I'm sure there's like a lot of really cool like computer science. See people that 124 00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.239 Jenny Duan: you know would be like a really awesome fit. I wonder 125 00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:36.069 Jenny Duan: how you would find that maybe on Linkedin, or even like social media, would maybe a good place to like, look for people and just try to build more of a community for people who are interested in like coding and hackathons or even in Hat Club. Are you in the Hat Club? 126 00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.730 huda: Slack? I think. Yeah. 127 00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.709 Jenny Duan: Is, there? Are there like local barrier channels that you can maybe like. Look at their members. 128 00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.199 huda: I can check like. 129 00:17:45.650 --> 00:18:05.909 huda: I wouldn't spend like too much time doing this, by the way, but just if you if you when you sign up if you need a mem, if you need, like a teammate, I think those could be good avenues to explore. But I wouldn't spend all your time doing this. Obviously, I think I could also like reach out to people from like my old school and see if they'd be interested. 130 00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah, cause? Well, I genuinely do think that, you know, like having a like knowing 131 00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:36.129 Jenny Duan: who the like talented coders are in your area are. That's I think that's just like helpful in general, just for like community purposes, but obviously for hackathons, too. But anyways, the point is, I think, that winning a hackathon or getting an award of the hackathon would be like, really valuable for your like Resume and college application list. I think that that's one goal we can try to work towards over the next, like, semester. 132 00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.680 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 133 00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.510 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Anyways. Last thing is, how's the game going? 134 00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:53.539 huda: It's going. Well, I started adding, like neural networks into the game. So like my analogy for this one is like. 135 00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.389 huda: So I kind of asked Chat Gp for help for this one. But basically like like 136 00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:17.849 huda: Sona, she's gonna be like a detective. And so you know how in neural networks will be like different layers. More like the first level, like neurons. They'll detect like really simple things, and then as like, the like, more layers do different things and more complex. 137 00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:41.679 huda: So I think I'm doing something kind of similar where, like Sona's a detective, and then she has to like find really like easy shapes in the beginning. But then like the robot like, levels her up as a detective. So she's like a level 2 detective whatever. And then she starts having, like these harder challenges. And then, that's basically like, kind of my analogy for like neural networks. 138 00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.929 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's really awesome. And like, how close are you to being complete with the game? 139 00:19:48.380 --> 00:20:03.609 huda: To be honest like, I don't know if I should make it longer like cause I already have, like 4 like mini games. But I feel like the game. Time is kind of short, so like I don't know if I should make it longer. But I think 140 00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:13.949 huda: I can probably just after this just add, like one simple kinda ending to it, and just like release that cause. It doesn't have to be too long, I guess. 141 00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:35.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, again, I think that the goal should be viewership for your game or getting the maximum number of players right now, rather than like trying to optimize for the length of your game. Because II think that your game is already like quite good like, I think that the features, the art, everything is already like quite thought out. And I think that the maybe the best thing you can do right now is trying to get more people to play it in general. 142 00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.929 huda: yeah. 143 00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:46.709 Jenny Duan: alright, now, maybe we can go back to your essays i'm wondering. do you wanna share your screen. And then maybe we can like talk through the changes that you've made 144 00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.750 Jenny Duan: and go through edits with that. 145 00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:56.500 huda: Yeah, actually, I think it'd be more effective if I share my screen that way, I can like, make it. 146 00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Can you walk me through the changes that you have made. 147 00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.499 huda: Yeah. So 148 00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:13.660 huda: so this essay. So this last essay I talked about kinda like, how young people today don't don't really like care for the world like except for themselves. 149 00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:25.679 huda: So I think last time I just had the beginnings. We don't really talk about it. So so the beginning I kind of talk about like specific examples, and like, repeat, I pray for days. 150 00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:46.460 huda: So I'm like, talk about how the bell drive by. Sylvia class talks about like women's mental health issues. And like the second part, I talk about performative activism since that's like really big and young generations these days. And then the last one I talk about 151 00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:57.959 huda: like kind of a more broad topic. I say, young people should develop empathy and care for issues larger than life, instead of being consumed by their own superciliousness. 152 00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:16.819 huda: Which, like just means like their own egos and then I added, like the sentence, like, I think I could probably integrate it better. But so the word immature is often associated with younger ages, but until what age is it considered immature and not ignorant. 153 00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.129 huda: I could definitely integrate it better. But then, after that 154 00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:27.470 huda: I talk about like a specific like instance which have 155 00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:51.599 huda: instance, which kind of like made me realize how prevalent it is. So In my school there is a club devoted to spreading awareness on disabilities like near divergence. The President happens to be er I don't think that's the right wording. But the President happened to be at my computer science class's table 156 00:22:51.780 --> 00:23:02.259 huda: one day he was. He and his friends were bantering when I heard the arser a derogatory term towards a disabled community which he wasn't part, which he isn't part of from his mouth. 157 00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:13.709 huda: It was shocking to see some one who displayed such a nuanced and charitable front disrespecting the community he once advocated for. But honestly, it wasn't. I wasn't surprised. 158 00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:26.609 huda: And then here I kind of we would like repetition again, so and sarcasm as well. So it was a lighthearted joke. Yes, he's a boy. He's just a boy. Yes. 159 00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:38.479 huda: he obviously still cares about issues larger than himself. Yes, but the issue with young people to day is that they are so self involved with their jokes and trivial matters that they fail to look outside of them. 160 00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:46.650 huda: And then so like I didn't really like come to the ending yet, but this paragraph kind of introduces like 161 00:23:46.980 --> 00:24:01.609 huda: like the caveat, to like my argument that, like young people should be mature like, like a lot of people will probably say, like, Oh, they're just kids like they're innocent like these are just jokes. But so I kinda like 162 00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:10.970 huda: rebutted it. So I was like, personally, I haven't been as connected to social causes my entire life. Like many other young people. 163 00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.220 huda: I 164 00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:32.440 huda: I had the mindset that if it didn't affect me it wasn't worth pursuing in middle school. That was around the same time that I began using social media where exposure to worldly issues is large. And so from here on, I was kinda gonna talk about how my perspective changed in middle school. How like 165 00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:39.590 huda: like seeing sensationalize news. Made me realize that like 166 00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:46.670 huda: there's more to life than about like my trivial like matters. And then I was gonna talk about 167 00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.140 huda: like, maybe 168 00:24:48.710 --> 00:25:01.699 huda: like talk about how my own trans transition of being like kind of self absorbed to kind of caring more about the world, how it can can apply to more young people throughout the world. 169 00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:13.509 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is really good like this is very nuanced and like quite thoughtful. And I think that it's yeah. I think that this is like, very good. I really like 170 00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:33.320 Jenny Duan: just like how vulnerable you are in this essay, how much courage shows in your voice, and I think it's like very powerful, and I think it stands out a lot, so I can't wait to see how you finish this. I think that I don't really wanna touch this essay until you finish it, because I think like right now, cutting down words or changing anything, wouldn't, I think, be effective until you're 171 00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:46.369 huda: done going through all your ideas. So I think I wanna leave this how it is and then I think it would be helpful to go through your other essays and like look through the word count and try to cut those down, since those are a little bit more finalized. How does that sound sounds good? 172 00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:52.820 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I remember, we have looked over this one, and we already cut that one down. I think this one needs 173 00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:53.920 Jenny Duan: to be. 174 00:25:54.610 --> 00:26:20.359 huda: Yeah, okay, also, for the one for the inspiration one. I was thinking like I might want to like rewrite it. Like, I could probably rewrite it this week, cause I just kinda realize that, like my mom is like the person that inspired me the most is really cliche, and it won't really stand out. So maybe I could do something more like abstract like I was thinking, like, maybe like 175 00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:45.409 huda: something really random, but like, maybe from the hunger games, or like just someone like that shows leadership qualities. That isn't my mom cause I feel like that's something that everyone would write about. I feel like it's fine that you write about your mom. I don't think that that's like. I don't think you should worry about the cliche. I think it's not necessarily about the cliche, but like how you write it. So I feel like that's not something to be worried about. However, if you think that there's someone else who hasn't started you 176 00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:53.930 Jenny Duan: in like a unique way that could be valuable, too, but I think that if you think it's cliche like, I don't think that that should be a major concern when it comes to this essay. 177 00:26:54.220 --> 00:27:01.610 huda: Yes, like, do you think like this essay would like stand out like there's like, definitely some edits I can make to make it more 178 00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:13.780 huda: special because I feel like if I was on like reading this, then it just kinda be like A lot of people learn things from their mothers. like, I know it's like cliches like 179 00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.940 huda: kind of 180 00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:24.389 huda: oh, like, it's not really applicable cause everyone does get inspired by their mom. But like, I don't know, how can I make it more like standing out? 181 00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.500 huda: compared to other people? 182 00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:37.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe what what could be helpful is if you want to be a little bit unique. Maybe you could write it in a way that doesn't reveal that the person is your mom. 183 00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:59.760 Jenny Duan: like from the beginning, and you reveal it at the very end. That way, like someone can cause. I think maybe what your concern is is that someone will read the essay be like, oh, shock about her, mom, like everyone talks about their mom, and then kind of glaze over the rest of it, because they already have this like conception in their head. But is that your concern? Or am I just making that up? Yeah, II think that's like, kind of a concern like, yeah, definitely. 184 00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:23.390 Jenny Duan: So I think what could be an effective, just writing style in general is just to like talk about the characteristics of this person first, like the struggles they went through, how they over claim it, how you've learned from them, and then, at the very, very end reveal that that's your mom, so that the the weight of the essay doesn't fall so much onto her being your mom, but rather on, like her attributes and the things that she's shown you, and then, like by the end, they've already, they already have this like image of 185 00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:31.419 Jenny Duan: this person in their head, the reader's head. And so when you reveal that it's your mom. It doesn't like really change their perception of the situation, whereas introducing them as 186 00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:41.929 Jenny Duan: your mom in the beginning might already give them like some type of idea about what they would imagine, like a mom's impact or leadership might have that could bias them towards the rest of your essay. 187 00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.760 huda: That's that's a really good idea. I think I'll I'll work on that later. Then. 188 00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.630 Jenny Duan: Oh, then I'll make a note to do that right from the perspective 189 00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.060 Jenny Duan: right or review the person's 190 00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:14.259 Jenny Duan: identity. Let's see your mom at the end. Okay, so I think maybe we won't touch this essay until you finish that, I think, let's do. We were able to cut this one down. Let me check. Okay, no, I think. Let's work on cutting this essay down. We have about 500 words to cut. 191 00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.770 Jenny Duan: Okay, not one 192 00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:30.410 Jenny Duan: of my 15 female friends. And it's a family gathering. I open my. I opened Gmail. Okay, I'm just gonna say, open gmail. Everyone knows what Gmail is. So it's a 193 00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:38.360 Jenny Duan: to the Muslim Student Association election results. President, vice President, not one of my 15 female friends got a single swamp 194 00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.340 Jenny Duan: the day after. 195 00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:46.060 Jenny Duan: I'm going to say the next day, just a little bit shorter. I contested this result. 196 00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.600 Jenny Duan: for I went to contest this result. 197 00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.070 Jenny Duan: Marching. I opened 198 00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.310 Jenny Duan: I opened the door to see if 2 199 00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:17.590 Jenny Duan: to see Rose filled with Rose let's say, of non Muslim boys sitting. Refusing to stand in the corner, I found my friends awkwardly. 200 00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.580 Jenny Duan: I found my friends 201 00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.640 Jenny Duan: awkwardly standing with their lunches 202 00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.950 huda: in their hands by saying, Timothy. 203 00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.020 Jenny Duan: yeah. 204 00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.920 Jenny Duan: hintered to Muslims as a whole. But Muslim woman's women were value so little. 205 00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.579 Jenny Duan: So I made it my mission to give girls 206 00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.000 Jenny Duan: like maybe, my friends, I think my friends and I 207 00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.230 Jenny Duan: and I the same opportunities we were denied. 208 00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:56.650 Jenny Duan: That might. 209 00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:58.819 Jenny Duan: That's cool. 210 00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:06.340 Jenny Duan: The film club previously only had one girl in 5 officer roles. As president of the club 211 00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.880 Jenny Duan: this year I 212 00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.410 Jenny Duan: admitted 213 00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.490 Jenny Duan: 3 plus 214 00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.640 Jenny Duan: wildfire girls in a board of 5 officers. 215 00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:27.010 Jenny Duan: This is just this is just a baby step in the future. I hope to Co create when seaplas were made 216 00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:40.220 Jenny Duan: 90, 99. 217 00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.860 Jenny Duan: They weren't designed with women in mind. 218 00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:02.009 Jenny Duan: or maybe they? They were designed with only the average male body in mud. 219 00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.050 If you're gentle. 220 00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.400 the female 221 00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:15.070 Jenny Duan: car crash! Death toll remained high until the late late 1970 s. 222 00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:21.029 Jenny Duan: When researches led female centered safety research for the first time. 223 00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:31.600 Jenny Duan: that is nearly 30 years of a missing perspective from 50%. 224 00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:36.800 Jenny Duan: Of the world. Leadership saves lives by empowering women to fix seatbelts. 225 00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:42.169 Jenny Duan: Leadership platformed woman to explain the struggles of wearing a job, leadership. 226 00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:51.240 Jenny Duan: captures every perspective. Not just the most dominant one. 227 00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:53.590 Jenny Duan: See. 228 00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:07.100 huda: 1,000 characters is really short. Let's test. Let's see how much we would also change the like. The boy names like the people that got it cause those are actually the ones, anyway. So 229 00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:16.550 Jenny Duan: can you make them shorter? What are some examples you could give? I don't think I would make that many. Okay, let me just delete publicity. I feel like publicity is like, not that relevant. 230 00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.360 Jenny Duan: I think you can keep the names. 231 00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:25.510 huda: Oh, okay, that's good. 232 00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:26.780 Jenny Duan: Oh. 233 00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:35.739 Jenny Duan: now let's see how much this is. It's going to be like every single letter will like, make a difference, because 1,000 characters is so little. 234 00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.980 huda: Yeah. 235 00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:39.550 Jenny Duan: family. 236 00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.190 Jenny Duan: I'm so say dinner, cause it's shorter. 237 00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.530 Jenny Duan: No, but 238 00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:49.130 Jenny Duan: not 239 00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.330 Jenny Duan: one away. No. 240 00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:03.570 huda: maybe I can replace this with in this side. 241 00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:10.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe. Say, contesting this result the next day 242 00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.989 Jenny Duan: I 243 00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.730 Jenny Duan: I've 244 00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.739 Jenny Duan: I'm march up to the room. 245 00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:36.219 Jenny Duan: opening the door to rows of Non Muslim boys sitting, refusing to stand 246 00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:37.870 Jenny Duan: on the side. 247 00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:46.219 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like the non-muslim doesn't really add that much context. 248 00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.170 Jenny Duan: Sitting 249 00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.070 Jenny Duan: sitting. choosing to. 250 00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.310 Jenny Duan: on the side I found my friends. 251 00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:05.469 Jenny Duan: How is it that a woman replied, so little? 252 00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:19.980 Jenny Duan: alright. 253 00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:31.600 huda: I want, maybe, like cater to. We can maybe like, say, encompass. 254 00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:36.899 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how about How is it that this club. 255 00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:41.190 Jenny Duan: yeah. Represent, I think, represented might be a better word. 256 00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.400 Jenny Duan: Since then I've made it my mission to give 257 00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.490 Jenny Duan: to 258 00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.890 Jenny Duan: give girls 259 00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:02.900 Jenny Duan: the same opportunities.

Let's say, instead of research analysts. 343 00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.170 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 344 00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.050 Jenny Duan: 11 characters. 345 00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:19.839 huda: we should like definitely increase the amount of 346 00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.460 huda: letters. 347 00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, agreed. 348 00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:31.520 Jenny Duan: I think qualified is probably implied.

For years. 352 00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:11.960 Jenny Duan: Wait. I think the issue might be that there's like extra spaces after these paragraphs. Let me just check to see that there's not 353 00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.760 Jenny Duan: okay. 354 00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:15.610 No. 355 00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.240 Jenny Duan: 3 characters. 356 00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:33.140 huda: maybe instead of amidst, I can just say, add. 357 00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.840 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. Maybe you see, like seat belts. 358 00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:46.199 Jenny Duan: how's this seat belts. Were designed in 1949. I think that should change that should fix it. 359 00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah, the midst is fine. We actually have some extra words. 360 00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.200 Jenny Duan: extra characters. 361 00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:01.680 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is good. 362 00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:03.040 huda: Do that. 363 00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.270 Jenny Duan: Okay. cool. Yeah. 364 00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:11.359 Jenny Duan: Okay, go ahead. 365 00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.859 huda: No. That was like that was like a lot of cuttings. 366 00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:21.219 Jenny Duan: I feel like we've still retained like the core of the essay, though. Yeah, which is kind of impressive. Given that we've put like. 367 00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.970 Jenny Duan: I think, about half of this since the beginning. 368 00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:40.939 Jenny Duan: Yeah, awesome. Okay, cool. So I think that our next steps are to for you to finish the edits on the inspiring person and to finish the last essay, and then we can continue cutting everything down. During our next meeting on Tuesday. How does that feel? Yeah. Sounds good. 369 00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:47.749 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and then, just like beyond that can you look into the 370 00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.610 Jenny Duan: Hackathon thing? And then my other note is 371 00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:55.740 Jenny Duan: so free. The letters of recommendation for this program you've already asked your teachers. Right? 372 00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:08.009 huda: Yes, I've at. I've asked, like one of the teachers. The other teacher. I was planning to ask tomorrow, because she was the one that kinda was like. She isn't like a push teacher. And then 373 00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:15.090 huda: it was kind of rocky, so like, maybe I can ask now. But the first teacher agreed. So 374 00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:25.740 Jenny Duan: okay, and then I think the other thing is, this is open. Now. It's it's due in March. But do you think this could be like something to think about? 375 00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:36.560 Jenny Duan: Jcamp? And then the other 2 important things that I just want to bring to your attention are for Carnegie Mellon, Pre college program. 376 00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:44.120 Jenny Duan: for AI scholars. You do need letters of recommendation for this. so I would I would. Get 377 00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.019 Jenny Duan: sorry I would ask your 378 00:49:53.560 --> 00:50:04.400 Jenny Duan: counselor and teacher recommendation before break cause this is oh, it's actually due on March in March. I think this one's fine. We can wait until that. But then the leadership seminars program 379 00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:08.539 Jenny Duan: are there any of these that you think you would be interested in. 380 00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:13.870 huda: I think 381 00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:19.409 huda: the power of investing might be good or actually global issues, maybe 382 00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:22.430 Jenny Duan: yeah, global issues. Maybe. 383 00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:34.880 Jenny Duan: I think this would be like, maybe something that you can think about, because the application date is January twenty-twond, and you will need have a 384 00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:50.140 Jenny Duan: letters of recommendation from at least one teacher and also your school counselor. So I think, if you plan to apply for this I think it would be good to ask your teachers before the end of break to give them about a month for them to write your letter. 385 00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.779 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? 386 00:50:51.810 --> 00:51:07.000 huda: Yeah. So for the counselor letter. My counselor doesn't really know me that will cause like I like asked her a few questions, but like we never end up meeting, because she says she's busy so like I don't know if like. 387 00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.590 huda: would I still be able to ask my counselor like, and have like a valid 388 00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.850 huda: letter. 389 00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:26.869 Jenny Duan: I think so. I think it's more just about. They need to have, like a transcript, a council report. This is more like information about the school, so I think. Well, you don't really have a choice like you have to ask your counsellor, because that's just what they require. 390 00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:38.580 Jenny Duan: so I think like, if you want to apply for this, it may be worth like setting up an additional meeting with your counsellor to like, go over it, or creating a recommendation fact sheet which we can work on together for your counsellor. 391 00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:50.940 huda: So for my calendar, would I be able to like so I know I kinda asked this question before. But like, use the same letter for like multiple applications. 392 00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:54.269 Jenny Duan: probably not because it probably asks different things. 393 00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.380 huda: Okay, yeah. 394 00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:04.939 Jenny Duan: But I think that, like it should be pretty simple. It's just your transcript school profile which they should already have. And then I'm not sure what this Councillor report is 395 00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:27.350 Jenny Duan: but if you wanna apply for this, I think like I would prioritize. So the things I would prioritize for you would be like Jcm. Cmu. The Cmu scholarship program. I think this is kind of like a secondary thing. If you wanna apply for it. If you don't feel like it's a good fit for you. Then that's okay, too. But I think, like. 396 00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:37.660 Jenny Duan: usually, there's not really a harm in applying for things. I think generally like the more things that you apply to the better. So. I would just try to ask your teachers for this before the break. 397 00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.859 Jenny Duan: yeah. Cause, if I remember, like, the application's not too extensive. 398 00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.050 huda: So I think, like. 399 00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:47.440 Jenny Duan: if you're able to, it'd be good to ask your teacher about this before the break 400 00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.880 huda: sounds good. Yeah. 401 00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:57.410 huda: Okay, cool. Then I will talk to you on Tuesday. Feel free to text me, if you have any questions before then. Yeah, okay, bye, bye.",

And so basically, I give the rundown. And so 2 of them are 26 00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.489 huda: already like starting to make their advertisements so and like, one of them's like for or both of them. 27 00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.089 huda: our college students. One of them is from like India, and then the other ones from New York. I think. 28 00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.799 Jenny Duan: Awesome. And then. So are there any other people that you are following up with beyond those 29 00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.329 Jenny Duan: 2 people? 30 00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:20.060 huda: Yeah, I'm a waiting reply, like I messaged him back yesterday, ",
    "but there's someone with like there's like so like at least 31 00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.490 huda: like 32 00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.240 huda: I'd say 7 more people that I followed up with. But I'm just waiting there on the response. 33 00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.200 Jenny Duan: Okay. would you send like, follow up messages with them to them. 34 00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:58.320 huda: Yeah. Like, I message them like when they applied like I message them. And then they replied, and then I just gave them like more details on like specifics on how they can get started. And then? Yeah. So I was working on updating the website. So that so that, like, I'd be able to post it from like the different locations and the different minorities. So I've been kind of busy with like updating the website as well. 35 00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.979 Jenny Duan: can you screen share your new website so I can see it? 36 00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.600 huda: It's kind of like filled with bugs right now. So okay, maybe after you finish updating that, then. 37 00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.239 Jenny Duan: awesome. Okay, cool. How's empowering a, I 38 00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.909 huda: yeah. So 39 00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:46.080 huda: So the speaker that we were gonna have, she said she wasn't available until like end of January, and I don't know why she didn't re like. Tell me that before. But I said, that's fine cause. Then we have like more time to gain attraction. So so also, for, like regarding the boot camp, I think it's really hard to find, like, gather like a certain time where a bunch of people are interested in everything. So we're wondering if we could just make like 40 00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:58.560 huda: really interactive, like courses like rather than like classes or like webinars cause I feel like courses which have like interactible like 41 00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:05.189 huda: projects. I think that would be really good. And it'd be like more easier to reach more people. 42 00:07:06.940 -->",
    " 00:07:15.449 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Do you have a plan for like making those courses? Where do you have to publish them? And how do you hope to do that. 43 00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.990 huda: I think we might try we might try putting it on our website that we already have so I think. 44 00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:36.810 huda: during winter break me, and my friend can like so we already made the slides right, so we can kind of go through that. But then I was thinking, like with a website, we can probably code it so that we have like a like a like. 45 00:07:36.810 --> 00:08:06.150 huda: like the code, like inside of the website. So then they could do it. Like as they're watching the video. So I probably be able to like program that into the website. And then, yeah, like, I think I wanna make it more interactive. Cause. Then it's just like a a random Youtube video. So like, yeah, I think that's a good way, and then on top of that I think we can easily build from that, then cause if we do end up doing more boot camps, then like, it'll definitely be easier to scale. Yeah. 46 00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:17.130 Jenny Duan: this sounds like a lot of work. So how are you going to make sure that people see this, because I think, like the biggest thing is just how many people you can get to like, notice your work and get involved with it. 47 00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:37.030 huda: Yeah, so I think I started posting like on social media for empowering AI like I started yesterday. But I think my friend has been like making like carousels for our Instagram page. But I've noticed those don't do really. Well, so I think we're gonna definitely like ramp up on like reels. 48 00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:49.220 huda: And I think, like word of mouth as well, and I think Linkedin is going well for me, and like it's helped me with Cynthoria and folklift. So I think that might be one way to get like 49 00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.879 huda: attract, like people that might want to learn ",
    "more. About empowering. AI, 50 00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.389 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm wondering how we can get you on like a feature something like. 51 00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:09.890 Jenny Duan: let me see, like 4, 6 young people who are changing the world like something like a feature like this would be really cool. To get you in an article. 52 00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:24.390 Jenny Duan: Oh, my, gosh. sorry, I have to pause my ad blocker. I'll show you this. but I think like things like this are really cool. I wanna figure out how to get you on something like this 53 00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:30.360 Jenny Duan: like this is someone I know who's in my great Armida at Stanford. She founded like 54 00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.380 Jenny Duan: let's see, empower Econ like virtual 3 day 55 00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.590 Jenny Duan: entreprene financial literacy camps for 56 00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:46.590 Jenny Duan: that have over 300 teens. So this is basically something you could do with empowering a, I like, you could basically do like. 57 00:09:47.110 --> 00:10:01.750 Jenny Duan: I think, the same thing. And like it links to it in Instagram Page. This is empower Econ, like, I think. if you can build a platform like this with like a lot of followers. I think that will be like impactful enough to get you in forbes magazine. 58 00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.480 Jenny Duan: like, I think what she's doing is not intrinsically different from yours, it's 59 00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:23.150 Jenny Duan: more just like good marketing. So I think that maybe you should like try to get someone to join your team who's really good at doing marketing or that's something you can try to learn, because I think it's just like a big skill to like, do graphics like this and get people interested in your work. 60 00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.170 huda: Sure. Yeah. 61 00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.800 Jenny Duan: So I'm going to just put this 62 00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:39.089 Jenny Duan: in here. Obviously, this is not",
    " for comparison. This is only for inspiration, like you shouldn't compare yourself to any of these people. This is another Stanford freshman. Right now. 63 00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:47.390 Jenny Duan: yeah, this is not like for comparison. This is more just for inspiration. So I think. Oh, maybe 64 00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.970 Jenny Duan: I wonder if you can. 65 00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.239 Jenny Duan: I wonder if you can pitch yourself to her? But I wonder how these people 66 00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.880 Jenny Duan: I wonder how these people they got their stuff featured. 67 00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:12.369 Jenny Duan: Maybe they just post a law on Linkedin cause she is obviously on Linkedin. And she obviously went to Stanford, too. This would be a good person to actually disconnect with. 68 00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.040 Jenny Duan: I think you should reach out to her and like, talk to her about what you're doing 69 00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.320 huda: yeah, for sure. Yeah. 70 00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:25.120 Jenny Duan: let me just put her linkedin here. She seems like an important person to know, because she also like I said, I went to Stanford. 71 00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:36.200 Jenny Duan: Obviously she has a lot of influence in like writing for Forbes. So if you can connect with her, maybe she can get you a feature somewhere that would be cool. 72 00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:46.650 Jenny Duan: Anyways, that's sort of another tangent that I think you should have just replied, for is this, it's called distinguished young woman. I don't know if you heard about this. 73 00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.840 Jenny Duan: It's just an award. 74 00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.249 Jenny Duan: It's not exactly a pageant, but it's like 75 00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.029 Jenny Duan: it's kind of 76 00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:02.299 Jenny Duan: like a pageant, but I think you should apply for it, because it's like a prestigious award that 77 00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.529 Jenny Duan: recognizes like powerf",
    "ul women in 78 00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:13.950 Jenny Duan: like all different states, it's a National Scholarship Program for High School girls. anyways. 79 00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.360 huda: I think this is something you should. I think you should apply for. 80 00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.619 Jenny Duan: I'm just going to put that 81 00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.580 Jenny Duan: here like the application. This form it takes like 5 s like it's it's just your name, your address. 82 00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.780 Jenny Duan: that you've never been married or pregnant. 83 00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:42.220 Jenny Duan: Which I think you fit like all those criterias, I think you should just apply for this. 84 00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.790 Jenny Duan: cool. 85 00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:51.030 Jenny Duan: anyways, those tangents aside. How's the film going? Any progress on that, or are you pausing it over? Break? 86 00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:58.930 huda: Oh, yeah. So we're like pausing over. Break yeah. Like, as I said, we need like to get the props and 87 00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.330 huda: everything. Yeah. 88 00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.450 Jenny Duan: okay. 89 00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:10.719 Jenny Duan: I'm curious. If you were planning to do any hackathons this year and is that something that you've thought about at all. 90 00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.839 huda: So I was thinking of going to cruise hacks. Exactly. Santa Cruz. 91 00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:39.300 huda: Oh, cool. Yeah, I want their last year. But it was like, mainly like majority, like college students participating. And I don't think any like high schoolers got the awards. So that's kinda like it was kinda off putting. So I was, I was kinda like thinking of not going to cruise access here. But yeah. 92 00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.430 Jenny Duan: hmm. 93 00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.070 Jenny Duan: yeah, that makes sense. 94 00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.269 Jenny Duan: Are there any like? I think there's are there any Bay area hackathons yo",
    "u could go to because I feel like 95 00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.260 Jenny Duan: there are 96 00:13:53.110 --> 00:14:03.780 Jenny Duan: a lot. So let me just do a search cause. I think right now what I'm trying to do for you. I think it would be good to like stack some awards on your portfolio like, I just think that that would be 97 00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:13.590 Jenny Duan: effective for you. One award. That I think would be pretty cool is Ml, H. Like top 50? That's just like 98 00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.279 Jenny Duan: an award for you to 99 00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:30.539 Jenny Duan: get if you just do a lot of hackathons like this person. 1718 18 etc. So I think it would be cool for you to apply for just and just doing like a lot of 100 00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.720 Jenny Duan: hackathons. 101 00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.419 Jenny Duan: So this one's in Sunnyvale. That's like is that pretty close to where you are? 102 00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.480 huda: It's about like an hour and a half. Yeah. 103 00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.700 Jenny Duan: Think this would be 104 00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.120 Jenny Duan: pretty cool. I'm just gonna put like a hackathon 105 00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:58.860 Jenny Duan: track hackathons here, because I think hackathons are like a really good award to have in your portfolio, especially if you're applying for game dev or computer science degrees. I think 106 00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:12.919 Jenny Duan: you know, cause hackathons have a lot of winners. Obviously, cause there's multiple categories. It's a pretty good opportunity, I think, for you to win an award. So I'm just gonna put that there and then. 107 00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:19.130 huda: I think I've actually participated in I saw like hijacks. 108 00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.060 Jenny Duan: I've learned before. Yeah. 109 00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.999 Jenny Duan: hydrax is that happening again this year? 110 00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.160 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 111 00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.10",
    "0 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 112 00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.100 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's happening. So I'm just going to put that there. 113 00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:41.840 Jenny Duan: Hydra hacks. Mateo hacks would be good. It's like San Mateo High School. 114 00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.630 Jenny Duan: and 115 00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:55.460 Jenny Duan: any high School middle school think this would be good material hacks. And you should. Do. You know people who like in your local area, who you could be on team with for these types of things. 116 00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:12.049 huda: See? That's kind of my issue with hackathons because I took my like friends who are in the Cs pathway for my school to the cruise hex but I found it was a kind of a struggle, cause they didn't really know how to code and and like 117 00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:18.379 huda: I was kind of up all night kind of working on it. But they didn't really like know how to code those 118 00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.600 huda: kind of one of the reasons. Yeah. 119 00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.690 Jenny Duan: is there, are there anyone that you know who's 120 00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:32.200 Jenny Duan: I guess you good at coding that you think you could be on a team with? 121 00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:58.660 huda: Yeah, like, I've tried asking like people outside of different groups, like some guys from like the Hackathon Club and everything but they kind of they take like the information, like, I asked someone if we could join, do the Congressional app challenge together. And he like. That's how he found out about the Congressional App challenge, and he joined it with someone else. So yeah, like, I think I can. I can probably try reaching out to more people and like, see 122 00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.710 huda: if there's anyone else that can I go that I can work with? Yeah. 123 00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:17.099 Jenny Duan: I wonder if there's just anyone like in the I mean, it doesn't have to be at your school like just in the Bay Area.",
    " In general, I'm sure there's like a lot of really cool like computer science. See people that 124 00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.239 Jenny Duan: you know would be like a really awesome fit. I wonder 125 00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:36.069 Jenny Duan: how you would find that maybe on Linkedin, or even like social media, would maybe a good place to like, look for people and just try to build more of a community for people who are interested in like coding and hackathons or even in Hat Club. Are you in the Hat Club? 126 00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.730 huda: Slack? I think. Yeah. 127 00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.709 Jenny Duan: Is, there? Are there like local barrier channels that you can maybe like. Look at their members. 128 00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.199 huda: I can check like. 129 00:17:45.650 --> 00:18:05.909 huda: I wouldn't spend like too much time doing this, by the way, but just if you if you when you sign up if you need a mem, if you need, like a teammate, I think those could be good avenues to explore. But I wouldn't spend all your time doing this. Obviously, I think I could also like reach out to people from like my old school and see if they'd be interested. 130 00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah, cause? Well, I genuinely do think that, you know, like having a like knowing 131 00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:36.129 Jenny Duan: who the like talented coders are in your area are. That's I think that's just like helpful in general, just for like community purposes, but obviously for hackathons, too. But anyways, the point is, I think, that winning a hackathon or getting an award of the hackathon would be like, really valuable for your like Resume and college application list. I think that that's one goal we can try to work towards over the next, like, semester. 132 00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.680 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 133 00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.510 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Anyways. Last thing is, how's the game going? 134 00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:53.539 huda: It's going. Well, I ",
    "started adding, like neural networks into the game. So like my analogy for this one is like. 135 00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.389 huda: So I kind of asked Chat Gp for help for this one. But basically like like 136 00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:17.849 huda: Sona, she's gonna be like a detective. And so you know how in neural networks will be like different layers. More like the first level, like neurons. They'll detect like really simple things, and then as like, the like, more layers do different things and more complex. 137 00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:41.679 huda: So I think I'm doing something kind of similar where, like Sona's a detective, and then she has to like find really like easy shapes in the beginning. But then like the robot like, levels her up as a detective. So she's like a level 2 detective whatever. And then she starts having, like these harder challenges. And then, that's basically like, kind of my analogy for like neural networks. 138 00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.929 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's really awesome. And like, how close are you to being complete with the game? 139 00:19:48.380 --> 00:20:03.609 huda: To be honest like, I don't know if I should make it longer like cause I already have, like 4 like mini games. But I feel like the game. Time is kind of short, so like I don't know if I should make it longer. But I think 140 00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:13.949 huda: I can probably just after this just add, like one simple kinda ending to it, and just like release that cause. It doesn't have to be too long, I guess. 141 00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:35.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, again, I think that the goal should be viewership for your game or getting the maximum number of players right now, rather than like trying to optimize for the length of your game. Because II think that your game is already like quite good like, I think that the features, the art, everything is already like quite thought out. And I think that the maybe the best thing you can do right now is trying to get more",
    " people to play it in general. 142 00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.929 huda: yeah. 143 00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:46.709 Jenny Duan: alright, now, maybe we can go back to your essays i'm wondering. do you wanna share your screen. And then maybe we can like talk through the changes that you've made 144 00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.750 Jenny Duan: and go through edits with that. 145 00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:56.500 huda: Yeah, actually, I think it'd be more effective if I share my screen that way, I can like, make it. 146 00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Can you walk me through the changes that you have made. 147 00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.499 huda: Yeah. So 148 00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:13.660 huda: so this essay. So this last essay I talked about kinda like, how young people today don't don't really like care for the world like except for themselves. 149 00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:25.679 huda: So I think last time I just had the beginnings. We don't really talk about it. So so the beginning I kind of talk about like specific examples, and like, repeat, I pray for days. 150 00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:46.460 huda: So I'm like, talk about how the bell drive by. Sylvia class talks about like women's mental health issues. And like the second part, I talk about performative activism since that's like really big and young generations these days. And then the last one I talk about 151 00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:57.959 huda: like kind of a more broad topic. I say, young people should develop empathy and care for issues larger than life, instead of being consumed by their own superciliousness. 152 00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:16.819 huda: Which, like just means like their own egos and then I added, like the sentence, like, I think I could probably integrate it better. But so the word immature is often associated with younger ages, but until what age is it considered immature and not ignorant. 153 00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.129 huda: I could definitely integrate it better. But then, after that ",
    "154 00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:27.470 huda: I talk about like a specific like instance which have 155 00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:51.599 huda: instance, which kind of like made me realize how prevalent it is. So In my school there is a club devoted to spreading awareness on disabilities like near divergence. The President happens to be er I don't think that's the right wording. But the President happened to be at my computer science class's table 156 00:22:51.780 --> 00:23:02.259 huda: one day he was. He and his friends were bantering when I heard the arser a derogatory term towards a disabled community which he wasn't part, which he isn't part of from his mouth. 157 00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:13.709 huda: It was shocking to see some one who displayed such a nuanced and charitable front disrespecting the community he once advocated for. But honestly, it wasn't. I wasn't surprised. 158 00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:26.609 huda: And then here I kind of we would like repetition again, so and sarcasm as well. So it was a lighthearted joke. Yes, he's a boy. He's just a boy. Yes. 159 00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:38.479 huda: he obviously still cares about issues larger than himself. Yes, but the issue with young people to day is that they are so self involved with their jokes and trivial matters that they fail to look outside of them. 160 00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:46.650 huda: And then so like I didn't really like come to the ending yet, but this paragraph kind of introduces like 161 00:23:46.980 --> 00:24:01.609 huda: like the caveat, to like my argument that, like young people should be mature like, like a lot of people will probably say, like, Oh, they're just kids like they're innocent like these are just jokes. But so I kinda like 162 00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:10.970 huda: rebutted it. So I was like, personally, I haven't been as connected to social causes my entire life. Like many other young people. 163 00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.220 huda: I 164 00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:32.440 huda: I had the mindse",
    "t that if it didn't affect me it wasn't worth pursuing in middle school. That was around the same time that I began using social media where exposure to worldly issues is large. And so from here on, I was kinda gonna talk about how my perspective changed in middle school. How like 165 00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:39.590 huda: like seeing sensationalize news. Made me realize that like 166 00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:46.670 huda: there's more to life than about like my trivial like matters. And then I was gonna talk about 167 00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.140 huda: like, maybe 168 00:24:48.710 --> 00:25:01.699 huda: like talk about how my own trans transition of being like kind of self absorbed to kind of caring more about the world, how it can can apply to more young people throughout the world. 169 00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:13.509 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is really good like this is very nuanced and like quite thoughtful. And I think that it's yeah. I think that this is like, very good. I really like 170 00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:33.320 Jenny Duan: just like how vulnerable you are in this essay, how much courage shows in your voice, and I think it's like very powerful, and I think it stands out a lot, so I can't wait to see how you finish this. I think that I don't really wanna touch this essay until you finish it, because I think like right now, cutting down words or changing anything, wouldn't, I think, be effective until you're 171 00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:46.369 huda: done going through all your ideas. So I think I wanna leave this how it is and then I think it would be helpful to go through your other essays and like look through the word count and try to cut those down, since those are a little bit more finalized. How does that sound sounds good? 172 00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:52.820 Jenny Duan: Okay. So I remember, we have looked over this one, and we already cut that one down. I think this one needs 173 00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:53.920 Jenny Duan: to be. 174 00:25:54.610 --> 00:26:20",
    ".359 huda: Yeah, okay, also, for the one for the inspiration one. I was thinking like I might want to like rewrite it. Like, I could probably rewrite it this week, cause I just kinda realize that, like my mom is like the person that inspired me the most is really cliche, and it won't really stand out. So maybe I could do something more like abstract like I was thinking, like, maybe like 175 00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:45.409 huda: something really random, but like, maybe from the hunger games, or like just someone like that shows leadership qualities. That isn't my mom cause I feel like that's something that everyone would write about. I feel like it's fine that you write about your mom. I don't think that that's like. I don't think you should worry about the cliche. I think it's not necessarily about the cliche, but like how you write it. So I feel like that's not something to be worried about. However, if you think that there's someone else who hasn't started you 176 00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:53.930 Jenny Duan: in like a unique way that could be valuable, too, but I think that if you think it's cliche like, I don't think that that should be a major concern when it comes to this essay. 177 00:26:54.220 --> 00:27:01.610 huda: Yes, like, do you think like this essay would like stand out like there's like, definitely some edits I can make to make it more 178 00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:13.780 huda: special because I feel like if I was on like reading this, then it just kinda be like A lot of people learn things from their mothers. like, I know it's like cliches like 179 00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.940 huda: kind of 180 00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:24.389 huda: oh, like, it's not really applicable cause everyone does get inspired by their mom. But like, I don't know, how can I make it more like standing out? 181 00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.500 huda: compared to other people? 182 00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:37.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe what what could be helpful is if you want to be a li",
    "ttle bit unique. Maybe you could write it in a way that doesn't reveal that the person is your mom. 183 00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:59.760 Jenny Duan: like from the beginning, and you reveal it at the very end. That way, like someone can cause. I think maybe what your concern is is that someone will read the essay be like, oh, shock about her, mom, like everyone talks about their mom, and then kind of glaze over the rest of it, because they already have this like conception in their head. But is that your concern? Or am I just making that up? Yeah, II think that's like, kind of a concern like, yeah, definitely. 184 00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:23.390 Jenny Duan: So I think what could be an effective, just writing style in general is just to like talk about the characteristics of this person first, like the struggles they went through, how they over claim it, how you've learned from them, and then, at the very, very end reveal that that's your mom, so that the the weight of the essay doesn't fall so much onto her being your mom, but rather on, like her attributes and the things that she's shown you, and then, like by the end, they've already, they already have this like image of 185 00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:31.419 Jenny Duan: this person in their head, the reader's head. And so when you reveal that it's your mom. It doesn't like really change their perception of the situation, whereas introducing them as 186 00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:41.929 Jenny Duan: your mom in the beginning might already give them like some type of idea about what they would imagine, like a mom's impact or leadership might have that could bias them towards the rest of your essay. 187 00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.760 huda: That's that's a really good idea. I think I'll I'll work on that later. Then. 188 00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.630 Jenny Duan: Oh, then I'll make a note to do that right from the perspective 189 00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.060 Jenny Duan: right or review the person's 190 00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:14.259 J",
    "enny Duan: identity. Let's see your mom at the end. Okay, so I think maybe we won't touch this essay until you finish that, I think, let's do. We were able to cut this one down. Let me check. Okay, no, I think. Let's work on cutting this essay down. We have about 500 words to cut. 191 00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.770 Jenny Duan: Okay, not one 192 00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:30.410 Jenny Duan: of my 15 female friends. And it's a family gathering. I open my. I opened Gmail. Okay, I'm just gonna say, open gmail. Everyone knows what Gmail is. So it's a 193 00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:38.360 Jenny Duan: to the Muslim Student Association election results.

I contested this result. 196 00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.600 Jenny Duan: for I went to contest this result. 197 00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.070 Jenny Duan: Marching. I opened 198 00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.310 Jenny Duan: I opened the door to see if 2 199 00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:17.590 Jenny Duan: to see Rose filled with Rose let's say, of non Muslim boys sitting. Refusing to stand in the corner, I found my friends awkwardly. 200 00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.580 Jenny Duan: I found my friends 201 00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.640 Jenny Duan: awkwardly standing with their lunches 202 00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.950 huda: in their hands by saying, Timothy. 203 00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.020 Jenny Duan: yeah. 204 00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.920 Jenny Duan: hintered to Muslims as a whole. But Muslim woman's women were value so little. 205 00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.579 Jenny Duan: So I made it my mission to give girls 206 00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.000 Jenny Duan: like maybe, my friends, I think my friends and I 207 00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.230 Jenny Duan: and I the same opportunities we were denied. 208 00:30:55.290 ",

They were designed with only the average male body in mud. 219 00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.050 If you're gentle. 220 00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.400 the female 221 00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:15.070 Jenny Duan: car crash!

The next day, 328 00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.500 huda: I open the door of the meeting. 329 00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.880 Jenny Duan: 42 or characters rolled 330 00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.819 huda: in a 331 00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:21.480 huda: maybe just say 3 plus qualified, qualified girls on 332 00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:28.990 huda: hi. yeah.

    "36 00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.510 Jenny Duan: maybe like sword. 337 00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.430 huda: 24 letters. 338 00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.510 Jenny Duan: Oh, thanks. 339 00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.030 huda: When 340 00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.060 Jenny Duan: 14 341 00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:49.820 huda: hmm. 342 00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.839 huda: maybe. Let's say, instead of research analysts. 343 00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.170 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 344 00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.050 Jenny Duan: 11 characters. 345 00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:19.839 huda: we should like definitely increase the amount of 346 00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.460 huda: letters. 347 00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, agreed. 348 00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:31.520 Jenny Duan: I think qualified is probably implied. I think that's fine. 349 00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.560 huda: Hmm. 350 00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.460 Jenny Duan: 6 characters. 351 00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.850 huda: Can we just do YRS. For years. 352 00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:11.960 Jenny Duan: Wait. I think the issue might be that there's like extra spaces after these paragraphs. Let me just check to see that there's not 353 00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.760 Jenny Duan: okay. 354 00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:15.610 No. 355 00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.240 Jenny Duan: 3 characters. 356 00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:33.140 huda: maybe instead of amidst, I can just say, add. 357 00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.840 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. Maybe you see, like seat belts. 358 00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:46.199 Jenny Duan: how's this seat belts. Were designed in 1949. I think that should change that should fix it. 359 00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah, the midst is fine. We actually have some extra words. 360 00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.200 Jenny Duan: extra characters. 361 00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:01.680 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is good. 362 00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:03.040 huda: Do that. 363 00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.270 Jenny Duan: Okay. cool. Yeah. 364 00:48:08.550 -->",
    " 00:48:11.359 Jenny Duan: Okay, go ahead. 365 00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.859 huda: No. That was like that was like a lot of cuttings. 366 00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:21.219 Jenny Duan: I feel like we've still retained like the core of the essay, though. Yeah, which is kind of impressive. Given that we've put like. 367 00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.970 Jenny Duan: I think, about half of this since the beginning. 368 00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:40.939 Jenny Duan: Yeah, awesome. Okay, cool. So I think that our next steps are to for you to finish the edits on the inspiring person and to finish the last essay, and then we can continue cutting everything down. During our next meeting on Tuesday. How does that feel? Yeah. Sounds good. 369 00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:47.749 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and then, just like beyond that can you look into the 370 00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.610 Jenny Duan: Hackathon thing? And then my other note is 371 00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:55.740 Jenny Duan: so free. The letters of recommendation for this program you've already asked your teachers. Right? 372 00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:08.009 huda: Yes, I've at. I've asked, like one of the teachers. The other teacher. I was planning to ask tomorrow, because she was the one that kinda was like. She isn't like a push teacher. And then 373 00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:15.090 huda: it was kind of rocky, so like, maybe I can ask now. But the first teacher agreed. So 374 00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:25.740 Jenny Duan: okay, and then I think the other thing is, this is open. Now. It's it's due in March. But do you think this could be like something to think about? 375 00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:36.560 Jenny Duan: Jcamp? And then the other 2 important things that I just want to bring to your attention are for Carnegie Mellon, Pre college program. 376 00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:44.120 Jenny Duan: for AI scholars. You do need letters of recommendation for this. so I would I would. Get 377 00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.019 Jenny Duan: sorry I would ask your ",
    "378 00:49:53.560 --> 00:50:04.400 Jenny Duan: counselor and teacher recommendation before break cause this is oh, it's actually due on March in March. I think this one's fine. We can wait until that. But then the leadership seminars program 379 00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:08.539 Jenny Duan: are there any of these that you think you would be interested in. 380 00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:13.870 huda: I think 381 00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:19.409 huda: the power of investing might be good or actually global issues, maybe 382 00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:22.430 Jenny Duan: yeah, global issues. Maybe. 383 00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:34.880 Jenny Duan: I think this would be like, maybe something that you can think about, because the application date is January twenty-twond, and you will need have a 384 00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:50.140 Jenny Duan: letters of recommendation from at least one teacher and also your school counselor. So I think, if you plan to apply for this I think it would be good to ask your teachers before the end of break to give them about a month for them to write your letter. 385 00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.779 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? 386 00:50:51.810 --> 00:51:07.000 huda: Yeah. So for the counselor letter. My counselor doesn't really know me that will cause like I like asked her a few questions, but like we never end up meeting, because she says she's busy so like I don't know if like. 387 00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.590 huda: would I still be able to ask my counselor like, and have like a valid 388 00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.850 huda: letter. 389 00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:26.869 Jenny Duan: I think so. I think it's more just about. They need to have, like a transcript, a council report. This is more like information about the school, so I think. Well, you don't really have a choice like you have to ask your counsellor, because that's just what they require. 390 00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:38.580 Jenny Duan: so I think like, if you want to apply for this, it may be worth like set",
    "ting up an additional meeting with your counsellor to like, go over it, or creating a recommendation fact sheet which we can work on together for your counsellor. 391 00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:50.940 huda: So for my calendar, would I be able to like so I know I kinda asked this question before. But like, use the same letter for like multiple applications. 392 00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:54.269 Jenny Duan: probably not because it probably asks different things. 393 00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.380 huda: Okay, yeah. 394 00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:04.939 Jenny Duan: But I think that, like it should be pretty simple. It's just your transcript school profile which they should already have. And then I'm not sure what this Councillor report is 395 00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:27.350 Jenny Duan: but if you wanna apply for this, I think like I would prioritize. So the things I would prioritize for you would be like Jcm. Cmu. The Cmu scholarship program. I think this is kind of like a secondary thing. If you wanna apply for it. If you don't feel like it's a good fit for you. Then that's okay, too. But I think, like. 396 00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:37.660 Jenny Duan: usually, there's not really a harm in applying for things. I think generally like the more things that you apply to the better. So. I would just try to ask your teachers for this before the break. 397 00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.859 Jenny Duan: yeah. Cause, if I remember, like, the application's not too extensive. 398 00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.050 huda: So I think, like. 399 00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:47.440 Jenny Duan: if you're able to, it'd be good to ask your teacher about this before the break 400 00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.880 huda: sounds good. Yeah. 401 00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:57.410 huda: Okay, cool. Then I will talk to you on Tuesday. Feel free to text me, if you have any questions before then. Yeah, okay, bye, bye."
