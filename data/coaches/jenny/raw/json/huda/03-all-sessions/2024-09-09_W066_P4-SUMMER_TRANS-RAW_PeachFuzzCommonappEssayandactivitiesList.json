How's it going. 2 00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.350 huda: Going? Well, how are you. 3 00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.830 Jenny Duan: I'm doing pretty good. 4 00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:26.050 Jenny Duan: yeah, just getting settled into school. And I'm like, I'm taing a class here for the 1st 3 weeks before school starts. It's like for sophomores. 5 00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.579 Jenny Duan: So yeah, how's your week going? Any new tests? Anything? Happening in school. 6 00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:43.255 huda: Yeah, actually, I had a stats test yesterday. And I actually started tutoring for my English teachers. She has like this class called Eld class 7 00:00:43.921 --> 00:01:05.560 huda: and basically it's for a bunch of people who don't know English. And then I started helping out in that classroom, and kind of helping out cause there's like people from like Korea, from India. There's like people from everywhere. And so she just kind of has to teach them English. In like a more basic way. And I've been like tutoring with that and helping out. And it's been really cool. 8 00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.519 Jenny Duan: Very cool. 9 00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.160 huda: Yeah. And then I've also been tutoring for ap lang. So a lot of. 10 00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.669 Jenny Duan: Also through school. 11 00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.400 huda: Yeah, I said, the same teacher, actually. 12 00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.890 huda: yeah, she's the one who's writing my recommendation. But. 13 00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.840 Jenny Duan: Really good. 14 00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:34.569 huda: Yeah, so yeah, I'm basically just tutoring like 2 juniors, and like reading their essays. And kind of showing them like, what? My, our teacher kind of works for? So, yeah. 15 00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.639 Jenny Duan: And how long have you been doing this for again. 16 00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.829 huda: I just started this week, actually. 17 00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, really awesome. 18 00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:51.050 Jenny Duan: And then I forgot. Like, how was the Stats test? Did you mention? If it was hard, easy, like, how was it. 19 00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.390 huda: I think it was relatively easy. Yeah. 20 00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.040 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Any other school updates 21 00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.590 Jenny Duan: on. 22 00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.550 huda: Okay, so basically. 23 00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:21.020 huda: on my like, on my areas, which is where we check our grades. I noticed that one of my grades did not get fixed. Cause like in ap hug. In sophomore year I got a B in the 1st semester, and then I got an A in second semester but then I apa. I got a 5 on the Ap. Exam. 24 00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:43.570 huda: And so the next year I asked my teacher if I if she could change my B to an a and she she also submitted a form. But I like recently saw, and it didn't reflect that on Aries. So then, I actually had a meeting with my counselor today, and I asked her about that and so I think, like my my history teacher sent in like another request, so that should be fixed as well. 25 00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:52.810 huda: And the same thing. Actually, there's the same error with like last year in my Cs class. My teacher entered like the wrong grade. Because she. 26 00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.560 Jenny Duan: So she. 27 00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:17.409 huda: Yeah, I had like an 89.5, and she said she'd round. She told me through email and in person, but she put a B, so then, yeah, she. I also talked to her and she said, she's gonna submit the form and I also spoke with my counselor. So to make sure it kind of like on both ends. They know what's happening. And so yeah, I think that's gonna get fixed. And so that that'll definitely improve my Gpa 28 00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:27.410 huda: cause right now. It's only at like around like 4 point like 2 5 weighted. But then, after those changes, it should be like maybe like 29 00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.720 huda: 4 point like 30 00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.969 huda: maybe like the high, like 4.4 6, or like something like that. 31 00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.830 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 32 00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.630 Jenny Duan: That's really exciting. And then what's your unweighted? 33 00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.069 Jenny Duan: What would your unrated be after those get fixed. 34 00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:49.710 huda: I think it should probably be like 3.9 5 or something like that. 35 00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.900 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's really good. 36 00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.539 Jenny Duan: awesome. Well, I'm glad to hear that those classes are getting fixed. How many classes in total is that? Again? 37 00:04:02.898 --> 00:04:06.479 huda: Those are just like 2 2 b's on my transcript. 38 00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.399 huda: and they're. 39 00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.110 Jenny Duan: Go ahead. 40 00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.159 Jenny Duan: Cool sounds good. 41 00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:17.490 Jenny Duan: Alright. So that's everything with school. Is there anything else about school that we need to cover. 42 00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:48.896 huda: actually I was thinking of like asking for my second letter of recommendation, so I already asked my English teacher, and she's doing all the all like the common app essay or colleges that I'm applying to and then so I've seen that like a lot of the colleges like require 2 or 3, or I think most of them require 2. Actually. So I was thinking of asking a Cs teacher, because once she's like, recommended me for Nc wit, and like the 43 00:04:49.249 --> 00:05:04.349 huda: like the other award and then also cause I heard that you need, like one person who teaches like a humanities type thing like English. And then you need someone who's more like sciencey, or like, yeah, more stem related. 44 00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.389 huda: So do you think that's a good idea, or could I do? I need to target someone else. 45 00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:16.680 Jenny Duan: No, that seems good as long as you have one like science and one humanities. That seems like a good idea. 46 00:05:17.247 --> 00:05:22.329 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then is that all for school, or is there anything else you want to cover here. 47 00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.270 huda: That should be all. 48 00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:33.479 Jenny Duan: Okay. I wanted to check in to see if you had a chance to think more about like Northwestern Northeastern, Usc. And Stanford. If you have any updates, there. 49 00:05:33.840 --> 00:06:03.450 huda: Yeah, actually, I discussed it with my parents. And I think we're moving forward with Stanford Rea, because, we found that the Northwestern was early decision. So it's like binding. We didn't think that would be like a good decision, because one it's like in a different state to if I get accepted into any other colleges, then I won't be able to consider them. So. Yeah, I think we're. We're going with Stanford and Usc. For early applications. 50 00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.869 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then you don't want to consider northeastern, either. 51 00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:22.220 huda: Yeah, I don't think I think my dad just really wanted me to do Stanford Rea and also like I think I'm not too passionate about northeastern applying early. 52 00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.529 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds good. Then. 53 00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.199 Jenny Duan: so how is your common app statement and your Stanford essays? How are they going. 54 00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:45.295 huda: Yeah, so I've done a couple like the supplementals for Stanford. I've come up with like 2 different kind of fleshed out ideas for the common common app, like the state personal statement. 55 00:06:45.750 --> 00:07:15.379 huda: like. Personally, I think so. The 1st one I wrote about like kind of like in like a code format talking about like my different identities and everything. And I kind of read that. And I realized there wasn't like a specific theme that jumps at you. Like, I think I saw somewhere online that admissions officers should be able to like identify you as like, oh, this like the Costco girl like so I think didn't really give that factor. So then I kind of came up with a different idea of writing about like 56 00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:29.110 huda: peach fuzz and I let me share it with you. But I guess, like I'm not, really. I haven't really got to like the super reflecting part. But I've done like I've written up with the story 57 00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:36.990 huda: and like hook and everything. So I think I just need to work on like the narration. 58 00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.130 huda: I mean, like the reflecting part. 59 00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.320 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 60 00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.030 Jenny Duan: And you I mentioned you mentioned last time that you had a 3rd idea. Have you done anything with that 3rd idea? Yet? 61 00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:54.249 huda: I don't think I have. I kind of forgot what my 3rd idea was. 62 00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.670 Jenny Duan: I think that was the let me take a look. 63 00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.500 huda: Was a little one. 64 00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.909 Jenny Duan: Yeah. The word o, 1. 65 00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:25.099 huda: Yeah, I don't. I? Haven't done anything about that one. But also one thing I wanted to think about was like cause for Stanford for, like one of the supplementals, I'm talking about Wordle. So I don't wanna like overdo it and like have it my common app and my supplementals, and I think it definitely matches more for my supplemental. So I think 66 00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.730 huda: I'll just skip past that. Maybe. 67 00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.029 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm reading your essay right now. 68 00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.080 huda: Oh, okay. 69 00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.729 Jenny Duan: Sorry. Yeah, it's not just like silent. 70 00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.770 Jenny Duan: Wow, this is cool. Okay. 71 00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.809 Jenny Duan: I really don't like the concept. 72 00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.000 Jenny Duan: I'm 73 00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.810 Jenny Duan: this 1st scene. I'm a little bit 74 00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.989 Jenny Duan: the 1st 2 75 00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:40.200 Jenny Duan: paragraphs. I'm a little bit I I get what the setup is. But I'm a little bit confused like, are you? 76 00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:57.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I get how you're eating a peach, but I feel like the personification is almost a little bit too strong here, where it's like kind of hard to distinguish before meeting the rest of your essay. If you're actually inviting into a peach for like, if you accidentally cut yourself while shaving, or if it's like a different scene. 77 00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.660 huda: Yeah, I think I was trying to do like, kind of 78 00:10:01.138 --> 00:10:07.100 huda: an interesting hook like I don't know if I took it too far. But like I was trying to 79 00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:21.979 huda: make people like wonder like, Oh, is this person like biting into someone's like head or something? And then like after on, like the 3rd paragraph, it reveals that it's like a peach like I think I don't know if I make it too clear that I'm talking about the peach. I think, like the transition is a bit 80 00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.700 huda: like lacking. But yeah, that's what I was I was trying to go for like a an interesting hook. 81 00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:36.080 Jenny Duan: I feel like this part breakfast feels out of place, because then it's like breakfast, then backyard, then classroom. I feel like 82 00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.280 Jenny Duan: like the place setting doesn't? 83 00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.059 Jenny Duan: Isn't linear. 84 00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.510 huda: like. 85 00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.889 huda: I think. 86 00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:56.259 huda: cause I what I'm trying to say here is like I I picked the peaches from my backyard that I eat for like breakfast, and then, like this is like a separate scene, like, I think 87 00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:02.380 huda: maybe, like the transition could be better. But like I'm starting like a new scene here. 88 00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:03.520 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay. 89 00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.740 Jenny Duan: Here. I would change this to detect. 90 00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.339 Jenny Duan: just to keep the shirt tense. I would say. 91 00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.950 huda: Editor, actually. 92 00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.720 Jenny Duan: What? 93 00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.610 huda: Let me add you as an editor, because, like I can't see what you're highlighting. 94 00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.830 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. 95 00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.360 Jenny Duan: I think this part can be cut just 96 00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.960 Jenny Duan: just to go here because I feel like this doesn't add anything. 97 00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.590 huda: Yeah. 98 00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.290 huda: I think this part is like. 99 00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.220 huda: it's kind of necessary cause like, that's like. 100 00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.750 Jenny Duan: I mean, just like here, the part with about Camille this. 101 00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.950 huda: Yeah. 102 00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:22.139 Jenny Duan: Like. Then you can go straight from here or here to here. 103 00:12:25.573 --> 00:12:28.909 huda: I'll just like reword it later. Maybe so. It makes sense. 104 00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:29.710 Jenny Duan: Make sense. 105 00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.890 Jenny Duan: What do you think about changing this line to something like 106 00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.190 Jenny Duan: Good thing. I'm a problem solver or something like that. 107 00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.539 huda: Yeah, I think that. Yeah. 108 00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.100 huda: yeah, I think that sounds better. Actually. 109 00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.740 Jenny Duan: What's the word? Count here. 110 00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.400 huda: Oh, let me see. 111 00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.819 huda: 7, 23. 112 00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.480 Jenny Duan: Okay. 113 00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.399 huda: And that's including, like the part where I'm gonna cut a little bit. 114 00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.140 Jenny Duan: Cool. 115 00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.330 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like this is really good. 116 00:15:17.653 --> 00:15:24.740 Jenny Duan: I love the like visualization and the way that you talk about your culture and your identity, and you weave that into like this antidote. 117 00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:33.849 Jenny Duan: I feel like what you could do more in the second draft is maybe cut some of the filler parts that like are more scene building than adding details about you, and then 118 00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.420 Jenny Duan: add some more personal information like I could see how 119 00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.250 Jenny Duan: you could weave like some more fun facts about yourself. 120 00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.170 Jenny Duan: maybe like. 121 00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.239 Jenny Duan: Sometimes I feel like an apple like 122 00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:52.409 Jenny Duan: or like even here, you could use an opportunity to say, instead of an apple, you could say like 123 00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.348 Jenny Duan: I don't know, Apple, the symbolic fruit that I don't know like 124 00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:20.410 Jenny Duan: you could. You could just try to weave some more symbolism into it, like somehow connect like an apple to like technology cause. That's something you're passionate about, or like another fruit. That's a part of your I get, I get how apple is supposed to be like a like a more Western fruit, or like a more common fruit, or you know. But just try to weave in more personal details. Where else? 125 00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:32.924 Jenny Duan: My resting on my instead of 7th grade speech and debate. Maybe you could say, like a computer science teacher, or like a games teacher or something that's more personal to you. 126 00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.020 Jenny Duan: let's see. 127 00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.269 Jenny Duan: maybe here you can talk about like 128 00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.310 Jenny Duan: spaces 129 00:16:54.370 --> 00:17:04.250 Jenny Duan: take, or in other places like, for example? You could say like, was I? Nothing but the space between my mouth and nose? I don't know. 130 00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.550 Jenny Duan: You'd say something like the hyphen between 131 00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:10.920 Jenny Duan: like 132 00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:19.269 Jenny Duan: this is like maybe a reach, but like the hyphen between, like Muslim and Indian, Indian American, or like you could say, like 133 00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:37.880 Jenny Duan: like your, how you take up space in places where you shouldn't like, whether that's being like a girl in computer science or like being like a Muslim person in journalism, or like something like that, how you always like, are used to like making your own place in spaces where, like other people might find it strange. 134 00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:44.895 huda: I think I think, like I actually really like this idea. And I could probably say, like, 135 00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:46.620 huda: like. 136 00:17:47.100 --> 00:18:03.609 huda: maybe talking about like how I put a hyphen in almost everything, because, like like you mentioned, like adding a hyphen between Muslim and Indian Indian and American Muslim dash journalists like, I think maybe like the hyphen could be like a continuing thing here. 137 00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:12.930 Jenny Duan: Exactly. And you don't need to write a lot about this like maybe just like one to 3 sentences, just to give your reader, a little bit more context about who you are. 138 00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.209 Jenny Duan: the sentence is good because it emphasizes like something about you. 139 00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.264 Jenny Duan: maybe maybe here you can say like. 140 00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.489 Jenny Duan: but today, do you see where I'm highlighting 141 00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.220 Jenny Duan: and say that maybe something like but today's 142 00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.830 Jenny Duan: but I don't have time today to like. 143 00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.190 Jenny Duan: admire their beauty, or like to 144 00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:50.439 Jenny Duan: try them on so like emphasizing something about how like your connection with your culture is through like 145 00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.000 Jenny Duan: the lipsticks, eyeshadows, and hijabs. And maybe you can say like. 146 00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:01.320 Jenny Duan: I don't know if there's any other like cultural beauty products that your mom uses. You could like mention that, too, but 147 00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.619 Jenny Duan: doesn't need to. You don't need to. 148 00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.790 huda: I can say like these are like Indian earrings. So. 149 00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, that's great. 150 00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.369 huda: So instead of like while I was tempted to try them out I could say like 151 00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.260 huda: I didn't have 152 00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.360 huda: time to 153 00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.249 huda: wear them, or. 154 00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:46.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I guess the point here is to put, like the reader, more forward into the story. So instead of describing how you feel like you should just show, or you should just like be more direct or be more 1st person. 155 00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.550 huda: Oh, am I supposed to put this in present tense? By the way. 156 00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.849 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be good. Like, I think all of this should be in price. Intense cause. That's 157 00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.760 Jenny Duan: what most of this part is. 158 00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:48.599 Jenny Duan: I feel like right here, Huda, in this like bathroom example. I feel like you're spending a lot of words kind of setting up the scene. Maybe instead, you can just like. 159 00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.259 Jenny Duan: look, look around and like, see? 160 00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.000 Jenny Duan: See Rahul. 161 00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:11.460 Jenny Duan: and just like, have him like mock you, and then you feel embarrassed, and you like, proceed to the next scene, and like, maybe there's if you do that, there's more space for you to write about yourself in another place, because I feel like here, just like a lot of words are being used on this context like, pretty much all of this. 162 00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.920 Jenny Duan: And I feel like you can get to that example quicker. 163 00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.941 huda: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. 164 00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.139 huda: let me just like comment, this. 165 00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.950 Jenny Duan: Okay. 166 00:21:50.592 --> 00:21:52.519 Jenny Duan: okay, go ahead. 167 00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.180 Jenny Duan: You can. You remind me how old were you? How old you were when you moved. 168 00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.140 huda: To like America. 169 00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.870 huda: I was around like 170 00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.280 huda: 6 171 00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.400 huda: or like 5 actually. 172 00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.390 Jenny Duan: What 5 173 00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:32.599 Jenny Duan: I feel like here, you you haven't. At the end you have an opportunity to write more about what makes you you? 174 00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.020 Jenny Duan: Could you talk about 175 00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.000 Jenny Duan: like the peach fuzz 176 00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:43.049 Jenny Duan: is the reason peaches are well, Peaches, you can talk more about like what makes you you. 177 00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.440 huda: Yeah. 178 00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:59.380 Jenny Duan: And it could be like some personality things, too, like like how you like listening to like how you like nostalgia, how you like like vintage music. How and like gaming, or other things that like make you you. 179 00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:50.119 huda: can I talk about like something like like technology, or something like, or does it cause like, I don't know if that would be like more serious. 180 00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.920 Jenny Duan: I don't think so. I think that you can definitely weave it in. 181 00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:55.510 huda: Okay? 182 00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.600 huda: Or should I talk more about like. 183 00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.220 huda: like when I bring it up like 184 00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:08.760 huda: as data science? Or would I bring it up as like game development cause. I think. 185 00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.600 huda: cause I can. I think, like some of the programs, I'm doing a lot of like data 186 00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.070 huda: data and like communication and like 187 00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.080 huda: stuff like that. So I don't know if I'd highlight that or. 188 00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.039 Jenny Duan: I think that 189 00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:27.670 Jenny Duan: it doesn't. 190 00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.499 Jenny Duan: I think that it's whatever you feel most comfortable with. 191 00:24:32.123 --> 00:24:37.959 Jenny Duan: I think that it doesn't really make a difference as long as you write passionately about it. 192 00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.640 huda: Okay, yeah. 193 00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.600 huda: I think I'll kind of like try to find a way to mention like 3 of them. 194 00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.240 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. 195 00:24:50.065 --> 00:24:54.740 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is a really good start. I can't wait to see. The next iteration 196 00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:04.370 Jenny Duan: is this the essay that you feel like is going to be your final essay? Or do you think you're gonna write another draft of a different idea. 197 00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:09.319 huda: I? Honestly, I'm really liking this one cause I feel like 198 00:25:09.873 --> 00:25:13.640 huda: it's feels like a little more unique than like my other ideas. 199 00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.770 huda: and I feel like it's kind of. 200 00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:25.449 huda: I don't know if this is the case, but I feel like it's kind of like special to me, and like like. I don't think a lot of people would like write about the same thing. 201 00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Sounds. Great. 202 00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:30.940 huda: But yeah, I'm like. 203 00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.400 Jenny Duan: It was like. 204 00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:39.240 huda: I could have like another a couple more drafts, but, like it depends on like if I could think of like a better idea. But for now I think I'm gonna stick with this one. 205 00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good to me. 206 00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:47.649 Jenny Duan: Alright. I'm wondering if you had a chance to. I know last time we talked about 207 00:25:48.063 --> 00:25:54.079 Jenny Duan: like Disney dreamers, essays, and then also Elks, do you have any updates on either of those. 208 00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.749 huda: Yeah, I actually did the 1st 2 essays for Disney dreamers. 209 00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:59.440 Jenny Duan: Okay. 210 00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:07.779 huda: Yeah, I I wrote like a really long one. And then I realized that it was like 600 words. So then I did like a shorter version as well. 211 00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.164 Jenny Duan: Okay. Oh, did you think it was 212 00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.390 Jenny Duan: like longer? 213 00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.029 huda: No, I thought it was 600 words, but I found it was 600 characters. 214 00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:28.730 Jenny Duan: Oh, oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry it's okay. You can probably miss a long one, for, like a different essay, just keep it because chances are like another scholarship. Or another prompt will make you write the same thing 215 00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.880 Jenny Duan: okay, i'm on it right now, so let me 216 00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:37.619 Jenny Duan: look through it. 217 00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.300 Jenny Duan: This is amazing. Yeah, really, good. 218 00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.970 huda: I like this. I like this one a lot. I think I did this one. 219 00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:10.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 220 00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.470 Jenny Duan: this is really good.

Drafts by tomorrow for like a meeting. But yeah. 226 00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah. When do you see applications coming up? Right? 227 00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.880 huda: Yeah. 228 00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.379 Jenny Duan: How are you feeling? Are you ready. 229 00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:52.090 huda: Honestly like the essay. Questions are so much more different than like anything that I've like ever answered like even for like summer programs and common app like, I feel like it's vastly different because you kind of like 230 00:27:52.140 --> 00:28:07.849 huda: supposed to talk about your academic achievements. And I feel like, whenever I see stuff with like common app and like these like programs, I feel like, I don't really talk about my academic achievements. But like, there's like a lot about that in the Uc, so it's definitely different. And like, I think. 231 00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.110 huda: I don't know, I'm just not really like 232 00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.799 huda: I I don't really like that writing style, so I guess I'm kind of stuck with that. 233 00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:23.589 Jenny Duan: Okay, you've got it. And you do have academic achievement. So I don't think there's anything to be worried about. 234 00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you'll be fine 235 00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.010 Jenny Duan: awesome 236 00:28:30.183 --> 00:28:31.110 Jenny Duan: I would. 237 00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:36.980 huda: I was. I was wondering if we could take a look at the Act Activities section for the common app because. 238 00:28:37.453 --> 00:28:46.759 huda: actually, I talked to like one of the people that live like near me, and she goes to Stanford and she's I just kind of like asked her a little bit about like 239 00:28:47.061 --> 00:28:58.120 huda: how was like like, how does she get into Stanford from Mount House? And she told me, like a big part of it was like her activity descriptions. So I was wondering if we could like kind of take a look at that. 240 00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.739 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And also, what did she say specifically about 241 00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.609 Jenny Duan: proactivity, descriptions. 242 00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:11.879 huda: She said to like definitely like, show, like your impact and like numbers which I think you already told me. But so like. 243 00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.710 huda: yeah, 244 00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.899 huda: yeah. And then she's definitely said to kind of 245 00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:25.800 huda: put your like extra curriculars in a like an order that like shows like importance and impact. It's like the larger numbers at the top. So yeah. 246 00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:38.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree. I think it's like, also, like the activities that you spend the most time on. Put those in the beginning. Do you have a document where you have all your activities lists like drafted out. 247 00:29:38.823 --> 00:29:41.950 huda: I actually haven't drafted them yet, so I think I'll start a new one. 248 00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.149 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's make a document for that. 249 00:29:50.240 --> 00:30:14.820 huda: Also, since. I wasn't able to hear back from like my, which is like the Muslim youth, North America. I was wondering if, instead of like in that space for like the extracurricular I could possibly put like the eld class that I'm tutoring for, because I feel like it's kind of impactful because like, I feel like as an immigrant like helping other immigrants kind of 250 00:30:15.184 --> 00:30:29.479 huda: like really fits into my profile. Because also, I'm like, really into education. I do a lot of like like English stuff like writing and stuff. So it kind of fits into my profile. But what are your thoughts on that. 251 00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense, and that seems like a good fit. 252 00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.090 huda: Okay. Great. 253 00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.660 huda: Yeah.

So let's let's just put everything in. And then we can go back and write the descriptions after we organize everything. So that's the most important thing. What is the second most important thing. 297 00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.529 huda: I think. 298 00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:15.532 huda: oh, actually like, in terms of like numbers. I actually like my social media. I actually like, I checked the analytics.

And so I think like that could be like one of the bigger numbers. But I don't think it should be number 2, because I don't know if that 301 00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:30.290 huda: really like fits too much. I mean, it does fit my profile. But like I think 302 00:34:31.081 --> 00:34:35.090 huda: synthoria might be like more significant. I think. 303 00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:43.669 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And then let's maybe put some Thoria, because I feel like it's also like the amount of time that you've spent on something. 304 00:34:43.959 --> 00:34:44.629 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 305 00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.760 huda: So when I say, like founder, or like developer. 306 00:34:52.232 --> 00:34:53.709 Jenny Duan: I would say. 307 00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:55.949 Jenny Duan: Founder, slash, developer. 308 00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.700 huda: Or I could say like solo to builder. Maybe. 309 00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:03.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 310 00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.680 huda: And I think this would also be under 311 00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.270 huda: computer slash technology. 312 00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.690 huda: Yeah. 313 00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 314 00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.459 Jenny Duan: And then there are 315 00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.030 Jenny Duan: it also be computer technology. 316 00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.890 huda: I could possibly talk about 317 00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:50.600 huda: Filmmakers Club. Maybe. 318 00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.960 huda: Yeah. Same. 319 00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.590 Jenny Duan: Good. 320 00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.210 huda: Sure 321 00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:28.370 huda: would it count as journalism, or just like art? 322 00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.359 Jenny Duan: I would say journalism, if that's the thing. 323 00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.449 huda: Yeah, I agree. 324 00:36:45.543 --> 00:36:49.180 huda: And then I guess I can talk about folklift like. 325 00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.970 huda: Yeah, actually, I'm not sure. Do you recommend putting like the content creation like. 326 00:36:55.990 --> 00:37:14.250 huda: or I guess, like having a platform. For I'm like, talk about technology. Would I put that higher than folklift? Because I feel like with folklift like I can talk about like having like an international writing base. But, we don't really have any like solid numbers to like present. 327 00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:26.810 Jenny Duan: Then maybe I put it lower, like, how does it also ask you how much time you put into something? Because I feel like that's also important. 328 00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.380 huda: Yeah. 329 00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:35.700 huda: it looks like it asks you how many hours spent per week and per year. 330 00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.320 huda: And then also. 331 00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.210 huda: like how many grades. You've participated in it. 332 00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.015 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 333 00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.850 Jenny Duan: yeah. In that case, I would also maybe rank things from like the most amount of time you spend in it. At least. 334 00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.110 Jenny Duan: So what else do you spend a lot of time on. 335 00:37:55.795 --> 00:37:58.700 huda: Wait! Let me actually go to the 336 00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.449 huda: Oh, let me go to the I think 337 00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.769 huda: we kind of did this some like recently with the 338 00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.960 huda: like. The naviance answers, so let me just double check on there. 339 00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:29.460 huda: I don't. We agreed to not put student use as a extracurricular, I think right. 340 00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.060 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 341 00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:32.365 huda: Okay. 342 00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.209 Jenny Duan: It's a class. 343 00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:41.109 huda: Yeah, I think folklift was like 4 h per week, 50 weeks. So that was 344 00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.479 huda: like a good amount. 345 00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.390 huda: So I did put like a good amount of time in there. 346 00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.850 huda: yeah. 347 00:38:52.520 --> 00:39:00.290 huda: yeah, I think that we could probably do folk lift, maybe. But I just I don't really have any like solid numbers for folklift. That's my problem. With that. 348 00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.760 Jenny Duan: What else do you have the solid numbers for? 349 00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.100 Jenny Duan: You should be at J. Camp. That's like pretty relevant. 350 00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.429 huda: Good. Yeah. 351 00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.320 Jenny Duan: That's like a big thing. 352 00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.060 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 353 00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.010 huda: attendee, or. 354 00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.910 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Attendee, maybe. 355 00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:33.160 huda: But I think 356 00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.259 huda: I think there's a specific category for like summer programs. 357 00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.755 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 358 00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.320 huda: Oh, actually. 359 00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.430 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, I don't think I see it. 360 00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:58.269 huda: Either that or either journalism or career oriented. But I think journalism might work better. 361 00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.899 Jenny Duan: I agree. 362 00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.770 huda: And then 363 00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.200 huda: I think 364 00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:19.430 huda: I also put a lot of time into like the Sunday school. Taing. 365 00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 366 00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:30.160 huda: I guess it's only like 2 HA week, but it's like, been really consistent, like I've been doing it for like almost 2 and a half years now, so I think, like. 367 00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.049 Jenny Duan: I think that that should be good. There. 368 00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.739 huda: Or should I put like the name of, like the 369 00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.040 huda: organization. 370 00:40:48.783 --> 00:40:50.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be good. 371 00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.579 Jenny Duan: And then you can say, like, Sunday school teacher, is your position. 372 00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:11.470 huda: And then I think it's just cultural or religious. I think I think religious. I don't know if it's an option. 373 00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.760 huda: Yeah. 374 00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.489 huda: okay.

I mean this week, and then I also wanted to see the rest of your Disney Dreamers Academy this week, because I also feel like an early application is better for that. So let's do that. And then our next meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday. Is that still a good time for you? 625 01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.830 huda: Yeah. That should be fine. 626 01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:21.840 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then if you end up finishing before then, just send me a text. And I can give you comments online. Yeah, are there any ones that you want like additional clarity or support on right now, before we end today. 627 01:01:22.725 --> 01:01:26.630 huda: I don't think there's like any of them that I was 628 01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:42.980 huda: really like worried about. Oh, yeah. But also I forgot to mention at school. They have this opportunity. Called stable talks. Let me see if I can find that email for more details. But it's like a speaking opportunity for 629 01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:46.480 huda: students like 630 01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:56.030 huda: speed. 631 01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:57.630 Jenny Duan: Opportunity. Sounds. Awesome. 632 01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 633 01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:01.210 huda: So I signed up for that, and like. 634 01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:08.699 huda: I think I can participate in this and like kind of get involved with like the teachers and like, student relationship there. So 635 01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.229 huda: yeah, I just wanted to add that. 636 01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:20.049 huda: But yeah, I think I didn't really have any questions about Disney dreamers. But 637 01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.210 huda: yeah. 638 01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:28.990 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, sounds good, then. I'll see you next Tuesday. 639 01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.749 huda: Yeah, I'll see you soon. 640 01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.510 Jenny Duan: Alright, bye! 641 01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:37.840 Jenny Duan: Alright. 642 01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.380 huda: Guys how. 643 01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.540 Ivylevel: Hi huda. 644 01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:40.720 huda: Hi. 645 01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.399 Ivylevel: Alright. 646 01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:54.189 Ivylevel: so thank you so much for staying. I just have a few questions. Thank you for your extra time with me today I'm super excited to hear about your 647 01:02:54.190 --> 01:03:18.870 Ivylevel: college preparation journey, and of course, the successes that you've achieved. So I just wanted to spend like 15 to 20 min to have this conversation, which is all about celebrating your hard work and your growth over the past one to 2 years. So let's start with your students journey? I just want to know, like same as before. Can you tell me like a bit about 648 01:03:19.525 --> 01:03:23.340 Ivylevel: when you're in college? Profile? And 649 01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:29.219 Ivylevel: preparation journey when you 1st started working with ivy level, how was it. 650 01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:47.740 huda: Yeah, I think definitely like, when I 1st started working with like Jenny and Ivy level, I think one thing that I noticed that everything was very specific. Because I've like gotten kind of help from like past people from school who got into good colleges. And I think 651 01:03:47.740 --> 01:04:11.588 huda: there's help is not like that specific. And I feel like working with these mentors. And like iv level in general, like, I think everything's been very specific and like they've given me opportunities to apply to. They've helped me with, like the essays specifically. And then also, like working with one one mentor like this whole time has been pretty helpful because 652 01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:25.610 huda: Now she knows, like all my extracurriculars, and she knows about like and like, when I'm thinking of new essay ideas. It's really helpful to be like working with one person, because now she knows, like almost all the things that I do. So yeah, it's really nice. 653 01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:30.959 Ivylevel: I agree, I agree. So. How about what were some of your biggest 654 01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:36.130 Ivylevel: college profile and prep challenges or concerns at the time? At that time? 655 01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:52.435 huda: Yeah, honestly, before iv level, I didn't do much for college prep like so I did do like some volunteering and everything. But I think I didn't really have that. Many solid extracurriculars, especially with like numbers and everything. 656 01:04:52.990 --> 01:05:06.400 huda: especially now, like applying to college. You have to like, think of all the numbers that that you have to input into common app and everything like that. So I think, working with Iv level I've been like able to like focus more on that. 657 01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:30.409 huda: But I also did have a bit of struggles with grades, because I took the sat a couple of times. I I didn't get that many. I didn't get that high of a score. And then I guess my Gpa. Wasn't terrible, but it wasn't like really competitive like, I didn't take that many aps earlier. But I think I started taking like 5 aps in Senior Year 4 Aps and Junior year. So 658 01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:40.870 huda: I've definitely been like pushing myself a lot after this. And yeah, I previously was not like that. And so I think that definitely changed. The way I do things. 659 01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:50.910 Ivylevel: Alright, thanks! How about? I'd love to hear about some of your proudest achievements, like what are the top accomplishments that stand out to you? 660 01:05:52.047 --> 01:06:14.532 huda: I think definitely like like for the first, st like I think ever award I won was the Nc. Wit award, and I think that was like my 1st goal with like Jenny as well. And so I think that was like one of my proudest moments. Cause I got the national Honorable Mention, and I honestly didn't think I was gonna get it. So I think that was like one thing I was really proud of. And then 661 01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:34.380 huda: I also, I think another thing was J. Camp, cause I I didn't really like. I just applied for it. Like. With the help of Jenny, of course. But like I, I wasn't really expecting like getting in, because it's a really competitive program, and like, there's so many people that are applied to it like I think, I think 662 01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:45.849 huda: when I 1st heard back from it, like, I think, I got my congratulations email when I was on call with Jenny. So it's pretty cool. It's like on my live live reaction. But yeah, like, I think 663 01:06:46.050 --> 01:07:01.950 huda: it has like a really low acceptance rate, so I wasn't really expecting it, and when I found out I got in it was really cool. And then, like, actually, the whole experience of going to J. Camp was amazing, so I think Nc. Wit and J. Camp have been like my favorite like accomplishments. I've gotten. 664 01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:24.599 Ivylevel: Alright! Thanks! Congratulations on that. We have heard a lot from your from your dad, so I know that your parents are also super proud of you. How about can you tell us more about your significant extracurricular post boost in general, like activities, awards programs, clubs, communities, projects, leadership and etc? 665 01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.495 huda: Yeah, I think 666 01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:31.905 huda: like, you wanna know, like a little bit about what I do or 667 01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:34.380 Ivylevel: Yeah, exactly. 668 01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:58.789 huda: Yeah, so I guess I I do like a lot of mix of like technology and journalism. So I have, like, I founded a nonprofit called empowering AI and I'm sure you've heard about it a lot from my dad as well. But like I do a lot of programs where I can like teach younger girls like, especially in middle school, about like ethics and how technology like 669 01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:15.310 huda: coding works. Basically and then I've also hosted a hackathon underneath empowering AI and I've been able to fundraise. I've kind of talked with some sponsors. I've gotten like people internationally to join. So I think that was like one of like 670 01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:36.989 huda: the most impactful things that I've done. And then I also, I also like made a game developed a game called Synthoria and then I've also like with, along with that game I made like this lesson toolkit, so it can be taught in classrooms, and then distributed that to like a lot of classrooms in the United States. 671 01:08:37.294 --> 01:08:57.075 huda: And I think I'm still kind of continuing that I'm reaching out to more people. But like, yeah, I think that was like my major game development kind of experience. And there's just like a couple of other things like, I I'm like the president of the Filmmakers Club. We do like short films every year, so that was pretty cool. 672 01:08:57.670 --> 01:08:59.910 huda: And then I 673 01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:26.159 huda: I guess I started I recently started tutoring for like this one class at my school for like immigrants who don't really speak English, and like I get to help them out and like, make sure they kind of like have different tasks like. For example, they have to describe an image in English, and then I can like help them with words they're stuck on and kind of making sure that they understand. And yeah, that's like. 674 01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:29.189 huda: kind of roughly what I do. But yeah. 675 01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:58.689 Ivylevel: Okay, great. I love the idea of teaching girls in the middle school and also teaching them the English language. I really love that part. Thank you for sharing that. How about can you please share more about your most significant community service or impact? I think that's kind of related to to the teaching part already. But how do you feel? These achievements have impacted your college application profile, so far. 676 01:09:59.951 --> 01:10:23.320 huda: Yeah, I think, like, definitely like, not. It wasn't just that English teaching tutoring thing that I'm doing. It's also like, I get to volunteer at my Sunday local Sunday school at the mosque. So I think that's another like community service that I work on, and that's like, I think, looking at my college application. Now, I think it's definitely helping me a lot, cause it shows kind of like 677 01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:40.119 huda: cause. I feel like. If admissions officers are reading it, they'll know that I'm Muslim, and they might see that aspect of me, because I don't know if that's really clear in, like my essays and everything. So that's 1 way to show my culture and like religion. And also, I think, it's definitely helped me because 678 01:10:40.421 --> 01:11:08.150 huda: the more I do. I'm all actually more eligible for the Presidential service award, and that means like you have to get 250 volunteer hours, and you get an award. And it's like kind of given to you by like the President. I I think it's just like it's like pretty common, but I think it's still a pretty prestigious award, and so I think, like volunteering, for, like the tutoring and then volunteering for the mosque that's like definitely helped me. Get closer to that goal. 679 01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:15.860 huda: And yeah, so I think, that's definitely helped me like in college applications. And like a lot of different aspects. 680 01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:27.829 Ivylevel: Great. Okay, how about how do you feel? You've grown or changed as a student going through the college prep. Journey with us with Iv level. 681 01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:37.401 huda: I think there's actually been a lot of change. I think I didn't really see myself as a competitive person. Starting out 682 01:11:37.870 --> 01:12:00.679 huda: especially like before Iv level. I took a lot of easier classes. I wasn't too I guess. Worried about my grades. I mean, I think I tried to maintain better grades, but I think I wasn't as competitive about them. And also I I feel like working with ivy level has like given me a different perspective on, like what I should invest my time on, because 683 01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:12.310 huda: I was thinking like, Oh, should I even like volunteer for this? This new tutoring service, where I can help people who don't speak English. And then I kind of thought about it in a different way, so that, like 684 01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:18.299 huda: cause as an immigrant myself, I think it will be pretty impactful like helping out other immigrants. 685 01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:29.339 huda: So I think that's like I kind of thought about it in that light which I wouldn't have thought about if I wasn't preparing for college. So I think, yeah, I that was like one different thing that I noticed. And 686 01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:38.150 huda: yeah, I think just in general, I've become more competitive and like I guess I value my education a little more than before. 687 01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:47.339 Ivylevel: Okay, how about? I think you have already shared a lot about your volunteering activities. And I think this 688 01:12:48.023 --> 01:13:10.789 Ivylevel: these activities or projects might have contributed a lot to your growth. So I just want to confirm if these tutoring activities or teaching activities have really showcased your growth. And if yes, how do you think Iv level or what type of support or resources Iv level did you find most valuable 689 01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:12.270 Ivylevel: for your growth? 690 01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:26.400 huda: Yeah, I think, like, like you said, it's definitely did like contribute to my growth as a student like volunteering. And I think working with Iv level has also been pretty like helpful to that. 691 01:13:26.727 --> 01:13:52.620 huda: Because I've been able to kind of have resources for like how to time manage with, like all these different extracurriculars? And I've also, I've also been able to like prioritize different things like, for example, if at 1 point I think empowering AI is more important than volunteering at the Sunday school. I I'll be able to discuss with Jenny, and then she'll let me know what to prioritize for, like the most impact. 692 01:13:52.973 --> 01:13:58.920 huda: So yeah, I think, just like with Iv level, you can kind of like if they help you like. 693 01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.520 huda: I guess, prioritize different things, and which will help you in the long run. 694 01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:19.799 Ivylevel: And I guess you've mentioned that having a coach or a 1 on one coaching session with Jenny helped you a lot right like he. She knows already. All the works that you've done or what you're currently doing, what activities 695 01:14:20.236 --> 01:14:27.300 Ivylevel: you love or and she can support you a lot, but I want to know as well what's like the most 696 01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:34.359 Ivylevel: loved example of a time. Your coach, or Jenny's guidance made a difference to you. 697 01:14:35.824 --> 01:14:50.439 huda: I think, definitely like this whole process in general. But I think in specific definitely the so many like programs she's introduced me to. I think. They're always so like hyper specific. And they're so like like 698 01:14:50.510 --> 01:15:17.779 huda: fit to who I am. I think, for example, this Disney dreamers program that she introduced me to. It's like they give you. It's kind of like a mix of like leadership journalism, like technology speaking. So it's like kind of like almost everything that I do. So I think she just somehow like finds programs that are very specific and like even J. Camp, like I wouldn't. I didn't know about it, and I wouldn't have applied about it applied to it. 699 01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.599 huda: But like, she just introduced me to like all these really different 700 01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:30.420 huda: programs which are super specific to me. And I think I've said this many times. But like, I think I really appreciate, like how specific, like everything is at Iv level. 701 01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:57.600 Ivylevel: Yeah. And I guess you have an open communication with Jenny. Right? You're like very close to each other since you've been working for quite some time already, and I know that you love each other. What what do you think is like the like? Can you give your most loved moments with your coach. That demonstrated like, you know, relatable, or any empathetic, or the the big difference in your in your journey. 702 01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:24.419 huda: Yeah, I think she's definitely been very empathetic about like, the different applications and things cause sometimes there's so many programs that I have to apply to and like for each of them, you have to write so many different essays, and I think she's definitely been empathetic with that, because sometimes, if I'm not able to meet a deadline, she's able to kind of like connect with me because she's also student, and she knows that there's like a lot of other things to be doing. 703 01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:34.470 huda: So like I think her kind of empathy in that factor has helped me like feel a little bit better, and also, like, been able to apply to more things. 704 01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:54.743 Ivylevel: Okay, that's great. Thank you so much for that. I know that you know as well that Iv, level's mission is to provide very specific and actionable advice. Right? Can you like share an instance where you received particularly helpful hands on guidance with with Jenny or any other coaches you've encountered. 705 01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:55.930 Ivylevel: yeah. 706 01:16:56.250 --> 01:17:14.389 huda: Yeah. I think with Jenny. In the beginning, we we were applying to bank of America student leaders. It's like a leadership program and so that time we were writing essays. And she gave me very, very specific, like essay ideas. And I kind of told her like my ideas about 707 01:17:15.138 --> 01:17:33.301 huda: I kind of want to talk about like the lack of educational resources at my school, and so she kind of wrote the whole like framework, and I can just like fill in the blanks and like write in my own style. And that's also definitely helped me with, like my my own writing style like. So now, when I'm writing essays 708 01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:45.713 huda: I feel like I'm more able to write by myself, and I don't really need too much of her help now, but, like her specific help in the beginning, was really helpful. To like forming like my writing style now and then 709 01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:57.739 huda: also definitely with coach. Marissa. I think she's a very good essay. Editor, I think. At least, for, like the Stanford, like common app essay. 710 01:17:58.450 --> 01:18:16.569 huda: She just like asked me a couple of questions, and then I was like brainstorming, and she like wrote everything down. And then by the end of that session we came up with like a really good like framework, and I think, like her ability to help me with like coming up with new ideas, was really really shocking. It was really nice. 711 01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:29.960 Ivylevel: Yeah, I'm looking into. I'm looking into your sessions. Every time. And I know that every session is productive, because I'm also looking into the to your documents and essays. And I can. I can agree that 712 01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:54.520 Ivylevel: they've boosted a lot from you, especially when it comes to ideas, to your essays cause. I also, I also agree that you have a lot of ideas and great ideas in your essays. I I've read a lot of things from your essays, and from the documents that you're sharing with me. So I totally agree with with the qualities of these coaches that you're you're encountering. How about you. I know that you know as well. 713 01:18:54.790 --> 01:19:05.530 Ivylevel: Iv. Level aims to be comprehensive, covering everything from extracurriculars to grades, to test preparations. I just want to know as well how does this approach benefited you? 714 01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:11.621 huda: I think it's yeah, actually like. Previously, when I was preparing for the sat 715 01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.600 huda: I was working with Coach Stephen. 716 01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:18.390 huda: And then I think that's been really really helpful cause 717 01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:37.860 huda: like, even my sister did like sat prep programs. And those were not at all like helpful. And they didn't like help her personally. And I think, I think, sat prep also, with Iv level, was also really different from other sat prep programs, because it's like one once again, like one v, 1 718 01:19:38.784 --> 01:19:44.040 huda: or 1 1 on one sorry and kind of like really specific. 719 01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:54.646 Ivylevel: Like a game one. v. 1 i know you're doing. I mean, I know you're making games. So it's okay. I can understand that I'm playing mobile legends, though. 720 01:19:56.050 --> 01:19:57.070 Ivylevel: Yeah. 721 01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:17.019 Ivylevel: so I still have a few more questions for you, Huda. I'm so sorry if it if it's taking like a a bit more time. So I just want to know did you use any other college prep service before starting with Iv level? Or how do you see us compared to other college prep services. 722 01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:27.830 huda: I actually haven't. I think this is like my only one, but like my sister's worked with like some counselors in the past. So I've gone to see how that works. 723 01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.110 huda: And they're definitely a lot less personal. 724 01:20:32.076 --> 01:20:33.110 huda: They're like. 725 01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:46.190 huda: Then they kind of don't encourage you to aim higher, and they don't give you specific help. But like I think, with Iv level, they prepare you to go to like Ivy leagues, whereas, like the counselor is telling my sister to be like more 726 01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:51.359 huda: like realistic. So it wasn't exactly helpful to her. So 727 01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:53.819 huda: I think that's definitely like a major difference. 728 01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.939 Ivylevel: How about what surprised you the most when you joined Ivy level. 729 01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:06.729 huda: I think I was definitely surprised with like, how relatable the coaches are. 730 01:21:07.052 --> 01:21:12.367 huda: Because, like, they're just students as well. And they're like pretty close to my age, and so 731 01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:22.579 huda: I don't know. I feel like we're able to like bond better because of that. And that way. It's like less formal, and I'm able to open up better for my essay. 732 01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:41.050 Ivylevel: And they are also like just fresh to being college right? So they can relate well to you. That's why they are really relatable. But if you could go back and give advice to your like younger self, I know you're still young. But at the start of this journey what would you say. 733 01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.259 huda: I think I'd definitely like, tell her to 734 01:21:45.685 --> 01:21:57.685 huda: be more ambitious and like kind of work on larger projects, cause I think I was really like scared to like, do giant projects. When I was starting out and 735 01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:04.279 huda: I could definitely like be benefiting off of like more hard work in the beginning. But yeah. 736 01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:12.789 Ivylevel: How about what's this? What's this one thing that you think that Iv level couldn't have done without or 737 01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.479 Ivylevel: found anywhere else? 738 01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:18.200 huda: I think 739 01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.509 huda: Iv level like 740 01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.475 huda: I think I I might like be reiterating. But I think 741 01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:35.880 huda: this specific help is like the biggest part about Iv level, I think, and like how you can access each mentor pretty much like pretty easily like you can message them 742 01:22:36.373 --> 01:22:45.999 huda: or you can email them like and ask them to just like check over your edits. And then they'll they'll do that. So I think that's like, definitely like a big difference with that B level. 743 01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:57.080 Ivylevel: Right. So, aside from the one on one sessions, you also have the offline support. I think that's what you're you're trying to to pertain. I mean, you're pertaining to right. 744 01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:02.089 Ivylevel: So how do you feel about chances of getting into your dream schools right now? 745 01:23:03.206 --> 01:23:04.430 huda: I think like what. 746 01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:07.459 Ivylevel: Percent. Can you give me like a percentage. 747 01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:11.769 huda: I think like given Stanford's like really competitive and 748 01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:21.651 huda: like, I wouldn't say like, my Gpa is like like the most like competitive out of all of them, and also, like my extracurriculars, aren't like crazy. 749 01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:25.670 huda: I'd say, like Stanford, I probably have like a 750 01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.000 huda: 20. I want. 751 01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.520 Ivylevel: You to be confident. 752 01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:40.939 huda: It's pretty. It's it's pretty big. But yeah, I I was saying, like, 20% for Stanford and Usc, I think, because, like the program is so like 753 01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:47.279 huda: specific to me, and I don't think it's too popular. I think I have like a higher chance of getting in. So I 754 01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:48.510 huda: probably like 755 01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.279 huda: 50 to 60%. I'll probably get in 756 01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:53.830 huda: for Usc. 757 01:23:54.615 --> 01:23:55.370 huda: and 758 01:23:55.470 --> 01:24:00.370 huda: Berkeley is just. I think it might even be harder than Usd, so 759 01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.400 huda: like 760 01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.138 huda: 25%. I think. 761 01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.670 Ivylevel: Alright! 762 01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:16.609 huda: Grantham, Berkeley, and Irvine. I think there's a like a solid like 40% that I'll get into Irvine 763 01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:24.050 huda: and then for the other, like East Coast colleges like Mit and everything. I think there's a very slim chance, because I'm out of state. 764 01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:25.550 Ivylevel: Okay. 765 01:24:25.670 --> 01:24:28.390 Ivylevel: so what's the 50 to 60%, 766 01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:29.689 Ivylevel: like? Again, you. 767 01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:30.820 huda: The, yeah. 768 01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:47.070 Ivylevel: Okay, that's noted. We'll see. How do you like? If a friend or family was considering getting support from their college prep. In the future with Iv level? Would you refer them to to us? And what would you tell them? Based on your experience? Then. 769 01:24:47.850 --> 01:25:11.390 huda: Yeah, I would definitely refer to Iv level. And I definitely tell them as like a word of advice to kind of make sure that your bond with, like the the mentor that you pick is good because I mean, like I had like different mentors I worked with, and some of them I clicked with better than the others, like in the beginning I worked with Janice 770 01:25:11.735 --> 01:25:38.239 huda: and we we didn't click that much like she did a great job in like helping me. Come up with ideas for what I should do, but I think I just don't think we clicked as much. I wasn't able to open up too much around her, and I don't think it was as productive. But when I met with Jenny, I feel like I was able to instantly click and her like opportunities and like relatability, and like kind of things that she provided were like a lot more 771 01:25:38.892 --> 01:25:40.429 huda: I guess, like 772 01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:54.139 huda: similar to like what I do and like I I just felt more connected to her. And so, like, I think I definitely recommend like whoever is joining this new service to make sure like that their bond with like the the mentor is good. 773 01:25:55.020 --> 01:26:13.500 Ivylevel: Right, I agree, and I can totally see that you're really having a great bond with Jenny. Given that you've been working with her for a long time now, and I hope that continues, and it leads you to success. How about do you think there are any areas Iv level could enhance its services. 774 01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:19.310 huda: I think one thing is there's like 775 01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:24.848 huda: a lot of documents like I think I don't know if it's just me. But there's like a lot of documents. 776 01:26:25.130 --> 01:26:28.063 huda: and sometimes I get a bit confused because 777 01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:29.740 huda: like. 778 01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:32.639 huda: for example, there's 1 where it's like 779 01:26:33.116 --> 01:26:45.593 huda: Jenny, Marissa, and Erin. But then there's another one which is just Jenny and Erin, and so like marissa was typing on a separate one. So I was like really confused, but 780 01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:47.140 Ivylevel: Oh, okay. 781 01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:49.330 huda: I think we fixed that, though, I think. 782 01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:53.139 huda: But yeah, like sometimes that's a bit confusing. But 783 01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:54.779 huda: other than that, I don't think 784 01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.340 huda: there's Major 785 01:26:56.370 --> 01:26:59.503 huda: feedback. But yeah, like, sometimes 786 01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:08.789 huda: like some of the coaches. They don't like help as much during the essays like, I think it's just like like, for example. Sometimes 787 01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:17.257 huda: I think it's cause, like Jenny feels like I'm like better at writing, so she doesn't need to support me as much. But sometimes I'm like the really lost and 788 01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:31.020 huda: like she's not able to like kind of like. Write a little bit for me. So I think that sometimes like it kind of catches me off guard sometimes. But yeah, I think like she doesn't do that like a lot. It's just sometimes. But yeah. 789 01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:48.500 Ivylevel: Thank you for that. I I really appreciate that comment or feedback in regards to any any experience that could improve. The service of Iv level. I really appreciate it. I just want to know if there's anything else you'd like to share about your journey or experience that we haven't covered right now. 790 01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:54.534 huda: I think I mainly talked about everything. But 791 01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:02.438 huda: yeah, just like I think additional comments is that I think I had a really great experience with Iv level. And 792 01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:13.370 huda: like, yeah, I don't think I've ever had that many like negative like experiences with an Iv level. So I don't really like have any solid like feedback to give cause. I think everything's been pretty smooth. 793 01:28:16.630 --> 01:28:42.930 Ivylevel: Thank you, Huda. I really appreciate all the comments and the time you've put into this I know that we stayed for like almost 30 min here, but I want to thank you so much for your for your journey with me today, and I am really proud of you. For what have you achieved? I I know that those are no, those are not just so so. Awards. I know those. Every every award that you get is prestigious, I believe, because you've you've 794 01:28:43.389 --> 01:28:58.930 Ivylevel: put efforts into it. You had. I mean, it's all hard work, right? So it just deserves to be paid paid off. So your insights are truly encouraging to us. As we prepare to help more students. Like yourself. 795 01:28:59.241 --> 01:29:15.750 Ivylevel: To to be a part of the Iv level. And as you progress in college prep and applications know that we're all rooting for you, and you've shown incredible growth, I can see that it's it's really visible in in all the documents and in all the awards. And I I know that 796 01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:35.762 Ivylevel: everyone's confident about you. All your coaches, your dad and Iv level itself is confident that you'll ace in the remaining stretch. So we wish you the very best, very best, and I know that you've got this. So if you don't have any questions, or if you have questions, you can always reach out to me, or, you know, to 797 01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:50.700 Ivylevel: through the email or phone number.

How's it going. 2 00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.350 huda: Going? Well, how are you. 3 00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.830 Jenny Duan: I'm doing pretty good. 4 00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:26.050 Jenny Duan: yeah, just getting settled into school. And I'm like, I'm taing a class here for the 1st 3 weeks before school starts. It's like for sophomores. 5 00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.579 Jenny Duan: So yeah, how's your week going? Any new tests? Anything? Happening in school. 6 00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:43.255 huda: Yeah, actually, I had a stats test yesterday. And I actually started tutoring for my English teachers. She has like this class called Eld class 7 00:00:43.921 --> 00:01:05.560 huda: and basically it's for a bunch of people who don't know English. And then I started helping out in that classroom, and kind of helping out cause there's like people from like Korea, from India. There's like people from everywhere. And so she just kind of has to teach them English. In like a more basic way. And I've been like tutoring with that and helping out. And it's been really cool. 8 00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.519 Jenny Duan: Very cool. 9 00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.160 huda: Yeah. And then I've also been tutoring for ap lang. So a lot of. 10 00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.669 Jenny Duan: Also through school. 11 00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.400 huda: Yeah, I said, the same teacher, actually. 12 00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.890 huda: yeah, she's the one who's writing my recommendation. But. 13 00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.840 Jenny Duan: Really good. 14 00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:34.569 huda: Yeah, so yeah, I'm basically just tutoring like 2 juniors, and like reading their essays. And kind of showing them like, what? My, our teacher kind of works for? So, yeah. 15 00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.639 Jenny Duan: And how long have you been doing this for again. 16 00:01:39.498 --> 00",
    ":01:41.829 huda: I just started this week, actually. 17 00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, really awesome. 18 00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:51.050 Jenny Duan: And then I forgot. Like, how was the Stats test? Did you mention? If it was hard, easy, like, how was it. 19 00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.390 huda: I think it was relatively easy. Yeah. 20 00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.040 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Any other school updates 21 00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.590 Jenny Duan: on. 22 00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.550 huda: Okay, so basically. 23 00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:21.020 huda: on my like, on my areas, which is where we check our grades. I noticed that one of my grades did not get fixed. Cause like in ap hug. In sophomore year I got a B in the 1st semester, and then I got an A in second semester but then I apa. I got a 5 on the Ap. Exam. 24 00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:43.570 huda: And so the next year I asked my teacher if I if she could change my B to an a and she she also submitted a form. But I like recently saw, and it didn't reflect that on Aries. So then, I actually had a meeting with my counselor today, and I asked her about that and so I think, like my my history teacher sent in like another request, so that should be fixed as well. 25 00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:52.810 huda: And the same thing. Actually, there's the same error with like last year in my Cs class. My teacher entered like the wrong grade. Because she. 26 00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.560 Jenny Duan: So she. 27 00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:17.409 huda: Yeah, I had like an 89.5, and she said she'd round. She told me through email and in person, but she put a B, so then, yeah, she. I also talked to her and she said, she's gonna submit the form and I also spoke with my counselor. So to make sure it kind of like on both ends. They know what's happening. And so yeah, I think that's gonna get fixed. And so that that'll definitely improve my Gpa 28 00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:27.410 huda: cause right now. It's only at like around like 4",
    " point like 2 5 weighted. But then, after those changes, it should be like maybe like 29 00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.720 huda: 4 point like 30 00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.969 huda: maybe like the high, like 4.4 6, or like something like that. 31 00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.830 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 32 00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.630 Jenny Duan: That's really exciting. And then what's your unweighted? 33 00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.069 Jenny Duan: What would your unrated be after those get fixed. 34 00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:49.710 huda: I think it should probably be like 3.9 5 or something like that. 35 00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.900 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's really good. 36 00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.539 Jenny Duan: awesome. Well, I'm glad to hear that those classes are getting fixed. How many classes in total is that? Again? 37 00:04:02.898 --> 00:04:06.479 huda: Those are just like 2 2 b's on my transcript. 38 00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.399 huda: and they're. 39 00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.110 Jenny Duan: Go ahead. 40 00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.159 Jenny Duan: Cool sounds good. 41 00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:17.490 Jenny Duan: Alright. So that's everything with school. Is there anything else about school that we need to cover. 42 00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:48.896 huda: actually I was thinking of like asking for my second letter of recommendation, so I already asked my English teacher, and she's doing all the all like the common app essay or colleges that I'm applying to and then so I've seen that like a lot of the colleges like require 2 or 3, or I think most of them require 2. Actually. So I was thinking of asking a Cs teacher, because once she's like, recommended me for Nc wit, and like the 43 00:04:49.249 --> 00:05:04.349 huda: like the other award and then also cause I heard that you need, like one person who teaches like a humanities type thing like English. And then you need someone who's more like sciencey, or like, yeah, more stem related. 44 00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.389 huda: So do ",
    "you think that's a good idea, or could I do? I need to target someone else. 45 00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:16.680 Jenny Duan: No, that seems good as long as you have one like science and one humanities. That seems like a good idea. 46 00:05:17.247 --> 00:05:22.329 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then is that all for school, or is there anything else you want to cover here. 47 00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.270 huda: That should be all. 48 00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:33.479 Jenny Duan: Okay. I wanted to check in to see if you had a chance to think more about like Northwestern Northeastern, Usc. And Stanford. If you have any updates, there. 49 00:05:33.840 --> 00:06:03.450 huda: Yeah, actually, I discussed it with my parents. And I think we're moving forward with Stanford Rea, because, we found that the Northwestern was early decision. So it's like binding. We didn't think that would be like a good decision, because one it's like in a different state to if I get accepted into any other colleges, then I won't be able to consider them. So. Yeah, I think we're. We're going with Stanford and Usc. For early applications. 50 00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.869 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then you don't want to consider northeastern, either. 51 00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:22.220 huda: Yeah, I don't think I think my dad just really wanted me to do Stanford Rea and also like I think I'm not too passionate about northeastern applying early. 52 00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.529 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds good. Then. 53 00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.199 Jenny Duan: so how is your common app statement and your Stanford essays? How are they going. 54 00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:45.295 huda: Yeah, so I've done a couple like the supplementals for Stanford. I've come up with like 2 different kind of fleshed out ideas for the common common app, like the state personal statement. 55 00:06:45.750 --> 00:07:15.379 huda: like. Personally, I think so. The 1st one I wrote about like kind of like in like a code format talking about",
    " like my different identities and everything. And I kind of read that. And I realized there wasn't like a specific theme that jumps at you. Like, I think I saw somewhere online that admissions officers should be able to like identify you as like, oh, this like the Costco girl like so I think didn't really give that factor. So then I kind of came up with a different idea of writing about like 56 00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:29.110 huda: peach fuzz and I let me share it with you. But I guess, like I'm not, really. I haven't really got to like the super reflecting part. But I've done like I've written up with the story 57 00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:36.990 huda: and like hook and everything. So I think I just need to work on like the narration. 58 00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.130 huda: I mean, like the reflecting part. 59 00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.320 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 60 00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.030 Jenny Duan: And you I mentioned you mentioned last time that you had a 3rd idea. Have you done anything with that 3rd idea? Yet? 61 00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:54.249 huda: I don't think I have. I kind of forgot what my 3rd idea was. 62 00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.670 Jenny Duan: I think that was the let me take a look. 63 00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.500 huda: Was a little one. 64 00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.909 Jenny Duan: Yeah. The word o, 1. 65 00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:25.099 huda: Yeah, I don't. I? Haven't done anything about that one. But also one thing I wanted to think about was like cause for Stanford for, like one of the supplementals, I'm talking about Wordle. So I don't wanna like overdo it and like have it my common app and my supplementals, and I think it definitely matches more for my supplemental. So I think 66 00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.730 huda: I'll just skip past that. Maybe. 67 00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.029 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm reading your essay right now. 68 00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.080 huda: Oh, okay. 69 00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.729 Jenny Duan: Sorry.

Okay. 71 00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.809 Jenny Duan: I really don't like the concept. 72 00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.000 Jenny Duan: I'm 73 00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.810 Jenny Duan: this 1st scene. I'm a little bit 74 00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.989 Jenny Duan: the 1st 2 75 00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:40.200 Jenny Duan: paragraphs. I'm a little bit I I get what the setup is. But I'm a little bit confused like, are you? 76 00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:57.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I get how you're eating a peach, but I feel like the personification is almost a little bit too strong here, where it's like kind of hard to distinguish before meeting the rest of your essay. If you're actually inviting into a peach for like, if you accidentally cut yourself while shaving, or if it's like a different scene. 77 00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.660 huda: Yeah, I think I was trying to do like, kind of 78 00:10:01.138 --> 00:10:07.100 huda: an interesting hook like I don't know if I took it too far. But like I was trying to 79 00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:21.979 huda: make people like wonder like, Oh, is this person like biting into someone's like head or something? And then like after on, like the 3rd paragraph, it reveals that it's like a peach like I think I don't know if I make it too clear that I'm talking about the peach. I think, like the transition is a bit 80 00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.700 huda: like lacking. But yeah, that's what I was I was trying to go for like a an interesting hook. 81 00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:36.080 Jenny Duan: I feel like this part breakfast feels out of place, because then it's like breakfast, then backyard, then classroom. I feel like 82 00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.280 Jenny Duan: like the place setting doesn't? 83 00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.059 Jenny Duan: Isn't linear. 84 00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.510 huda: like. 85 00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.889 huda: I think. 86 00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:56.259 huda: cause I",
    " what I'm trying to say here is like I I picked the peaches from my backyard that I eat for like breakfast, and then, like this is like a separate scene, like, I think 87 00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:02.380 huda: maybe, like the transition could be better. But like I'm starting like a new scene here. 88 00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:03.520 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay. 89 00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.740 Jenny Duan: Here. I would change this to detect. 90 00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.339 Jenny Duan: just to keep the shirt tense.

You could just try to weave some more symbolism into it, like somehow connect like an apple to like technology cause. That's something you're passionate about, or like another fruit. That's a part of your I get, I get how apple is supposed to be like a like a more Western fruit, or like a more common fruit, or you know. But just try to weave in more personal details.

And you don't need to write a lot about this like maybe just like one to 3 sentences, just to give your reader, a little bit more context about who you are. 138 00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.209 Jenny Duan: the sentence is good because it emphasizes like something about you. 139 00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.264 Jenny Duan: maybe",

So instead of describing how you feel like you should just show, or you should just like be more direct or be more 1st person. 155 00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.550 huda: Oh, am I supposed to put this in present tense? By the way. 156 00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.849 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be good. Like, I think all of this should be in price. Intense cause.

Oh, did you think it was 212 00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.390 Jenny Duan: like longer? 213 00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.029 huda: No, I thought it was 600 words, but I found it was 600 characters. 214 00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:28.730 Jenny Duan: Oh, oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry it's okay.

    "n it right now, so let me 216 00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:37.619 Jenny Duan: look through it. 217 00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.300 Jenny Duan: This is amazing. Yeah, really, good. 218 00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.970 huda: I like this. I like this one a lot. I think I did this one. 219 00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:10.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 220 00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.470 Jenny Duan: this is really good. Good. 221 00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:14.040 huda: Thank you. 222 00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, these are like, really good, really, good essays. Well. 223 00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:18.216 huda: Thank you. 224 00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.330 huda: I didn't get 225 00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:30.949 huda: go over the other questions, but because, like, I don't know I was actually had to like, have my Uc. Drafts by tomorrow for like a meeting. But yeah. 226 00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah. When do you see applications coming up? Right? 227 00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.880 huda: Yeah. 228 00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.379 Jenny Duan: How are you feeling? Are you ready. 229 00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:52.090 huda: Honestly like the essay. Questions are so much more different than like anything that I've like ever answered like even for like summer programs and common app like, I feel like it's vastly different because you kind of like 230 00:27:52.140 --> 00:28:07.849 huda: supposed to talk about your academic achievements. And I feel like, whenever I see stuff with like common app and like these like programs, I feel like, I don't really talk about my academic achievements. But like, there's like a lot about that in the Uc, so it's definitely different. And like, I think. 231 00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.110 huda: I don't know, I'm just not really like 232 00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.799 huda: I I don't really like that writing style, so I guess I'm kind of stuck with that. 233 00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:23.589 Jenny Duan: Okay, you've got it. And you do have academic achievement. So I do",
    "n't think there's anything to be worried about. 234 00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you'll be fine 235 00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.010 Jenny Duan: awesome 236 00:28:30.183 --> 00:28:31.110 Jenny Duan: I would. 237 00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:36.980 huda: I was. I was wondering if we could take a look at the Act Activities section for the common app because. 238 00:28:37.453 --> 00:28:46.759 huda: actually, I talked to like one of the people that live like near me, and she goes to Stanford and she's I just kind of like asked her a little bit about like 239 00:28:47.061 --> 00:28:58.120 huda: how was like like, how does she get into Stanford from Mount House? And she told me, like a big part of it was like her activity descriptions. So I was wondering if we could like kind of take a look at that. 240 00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.739 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And also, what did she say specifically about 241 00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.609 Jenny Duan: proactivity, descriptions. 242 00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:11.879 huda: She said to like definitely like, show, like your impact and like numbers which I think you already told me. But so like. 243 00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.710 huda: yeah, 244 00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.899 huda: yeah. And then she's definitely said to kind of 245 00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:25.800 huda: put your like extra curriculars in a like an order that like shows like importance and impact. It's like the larger numbers at the top. So yeah. 246 00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:38.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree. I think it's like, also, like the activities that you spend the most time on. Put those in the beginning. Do you have a document where you have all your activities lists like drafted out. 247 00:29:38.823 --> 00:29:41.950 huda: I actually haven't drafted them yet, so I think I'll start a new one. 248 00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.149 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's make a document for that. 249 00:29:50.240 --> 00:30:14.820 huda: Also, since. I wasn't able to hear back from like ",
    "my, which is like the Muslim youth, North America. I was wondering if, instead of like in that space for like the extracurricular I could possibly put like the eld class that I'm tutoring for, because I feel like it's kind of impactful because like, I feel like as an immigrant like helping other immigrants kind of 250 00:30:15.184 --> 00:30:29.479 huda: like really fits into my profile. Because also, I'm like, really into education. I do a lot of like like English stuff like writing and stuff. So it kind of fits into my profile. But what are your thoughts on that. 251 00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense, and that seems like a good fit. 252 00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.090 huda: Okay. Great. 253 00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.660 huda: Yeah. I just shared it. 254 00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.230 Jenny Duan: I'm sorry. 255 00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.870 Jenny Duan: Can you also put the link in the chat. 256 00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.199 huda: Oh, yeah. 257 00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.300 Jenny Duan: Things. 258 00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.410 Jenny Duan: Pardon. 259 00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:01.919 Jenny Duan: So you get 10 activities, and what is the character or word? Count for all of them. Again. 260 00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:13.909 huda: Okay, so it first, st you have to pick an activity type, and then you have 50 characters for a position, slash, leadership, description. 261 00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.849 huda: and then organization, name, and the Max characters is a hundred 262 00:31:18.666 --> 00:31:25.520 huda: and then describe this activity, including a more. You've accomplished recognition, is 1 50 characters. 263 00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:31.840 Jenny Duan: Wait, activity, name, and then activity. What category type. 264 00:31:32.717 --> 00:31:37.730 huda: Yeah, there's like position. Like the organization name 265 00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.149 huda: and the description. 266 00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.860 huda: And so that's like, 5,101 ",
    "50. 267 00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.170 huda: Me. 268 00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.869 Jenny Duan: And then the activity type is where. 269 00:31:54.992 --> 00:31:57.307 huda: It's like a dropdown like 270 00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.699 huda: let me actually share my screen. 271 00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.630 Jenny Duan: Like. 272 00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.390 huda: It's like academic art. 273 00:32:05.993 --> 00:32:07.179 huda: athletics, club. 274 00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.260 Jenny Duan: Go ahead! 275 00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:08.840 huda: Yeah. 276 00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.550 huda: fine. 277 00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.720 Jenny Duan: I remember this. 278 00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.260 Jenny Duan: Okay, so let's start with, what do you think is your most important position? 279 00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.009 huda: Probably empowering AI. 280 00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:19.799 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 281 00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.130 Jenny Duan: Let's do that. 282 00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.413 huda: I think 283 00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.520 huda: here, maybe. 284 00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let me. Just 285 00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:41.800 Jenny Duan: you can say founder, President, or just founder, maybe. 286 00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 287 00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:50.549 huda: And let me see, like what it fits under 288 00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.060 huda: technology or 289 00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:10.890 huda: yeah. 290 00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.690 huda: I think technology might make sense. 291 00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.170 huda: I go. 292 00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.839 huda: okay, yeah, computer slash technology. I think 293 00:33:36.853 --> 00:33:38.519 huda: and then description. I think 294 00:33:39.023 --> 00:33:41.529 huda: is where I need a little help on. 295 00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.400 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool 296 00:33:49.890 --> 00:34:00.030 Jenny Duan: description. So let's let's just put everything in. And then we can go back and w",
    "rite the descriptions after we organize everything. So that's the most important thing. What is the second most important thing. 297 00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.529 huda: I think. 298 00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:15.532 huda: oh, actually like, in terms of like numbers. I actually like my social media. I actually like, I checked the analytics. And it said, like overall, I had like 1.8 million views. 299 00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.640 Jenny Duan: Oh, that's super impressive! 300 00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:25.680 huda: Thank you. And so I think like that could be like one of the bigger numbers. But I don't think it should be number 2, because I don't know if that 301 00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:30.290 huda: really like fits too much. I mean, it does fit my profile. But like I think 302 00:34:31.081 --> 00:34:35.090 huda: synthoria might be like more significant. I think. 303 00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:43.669 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And then let's maybe put some Thoria, because I feel like it's also like the amount of time that you've spent on something. 304 00:34:43.959 --> 00:34:44.629 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 305 00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.760 huda: So when I say, like founder, or like developer. 306 00:34:52.232 --> 00:34:53.709 Jenny Duan: I would say. 307 00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:55.949 Jenny Duan: Founder, slash, developer. 308 00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.700 huda: Or I could say like solo to builder. Maybe. 309 00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:03.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 310 00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.680 huda: And I think this would also be under 311 00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.270 huda: computer slash technology. 312 00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.690 huda: Yeah. 313 00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 314 00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.459 Jenny Duan: And then there are 315 00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.030 Jenny Duan: it also be computer technology. 316 00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.890 huda: I could possibly talk about 317 00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:50.600 huda: Filmmakers Club. Maybe. 318 00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.960 h",
    "uda: Yeah. Same. 319 00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.590 Jenny Duan: Good. 320 00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.210 huda: Sure 321 00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:28.370 huda: would it count as journalism, or just like art? 322 00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.359 Jenny Duan: I would say journalism, if that's the thing. 323 00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.449 huda: Yeah, I agree. 324 00:36:45.543 --> 00:36:49.180 huda: And then I guess I can talk about folklift like. 325 00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.970 huda: Yeah, actually, I'm not sure. Do you recommend putting like the content creation like. 326 00:36:55.990 --> 00:37:14.250 huda: or I guess, like having a platform. For I'm like, talk about technology. Would I put that higher than folklift? Because I feel like with folklift like I can talk about like having like an international writing base. But, we don't really have any like solid numbers to like present. 327 00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:26.810 Jenny Duan: Then maybe I put it lower, like, how does it also ask you how much time you put into something? Because I feel like that's also important. 328 00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.380 huda: Yeah. 329 00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:35.700 huda: it looks like it asks you how many hours spent per week and per year. 330 00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.320 huda: And then also. 331 00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.210 huda: like how many grades. You've participated in it. 332 00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.015 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 333 00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.850 Jenny Duan: yeah. In that case, I would also maybe rank things from like the most amount of time you spend in it. At least. 334 00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.110 Jenny Duan: So what else do you spend a lot of time on. 335 00:37:55.795 --> 00:37:58.700 huda: Wait! Let me actually go to the 336 00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.449 huda: Oh, let me go to the I think 337 00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.769 huda: we kind of did this some like recently with the 338 00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.960 huda: like. The naviance answers, so let me just double check on t",
    "here. 339 00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:29.460 huda: I don't. We agreed to not put student use as a extracurricular, I think right. 340 00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.060 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 341 00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:32.365 huda: Okay. 342 00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.209 Jenny Duan: It's a class. 343 00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:41.109 huda: Yeah, I think folklift was like 4 h per week, 50 weeks. So that was 344 00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.479 huda: like a good amount. 345 00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.390 huda: So I did put like a good amount of time in there. 346 00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.850 huda: yeah. 347 00:38:52.520 --> 00:39:00.290 huda: yeah, I think that we could probably do folk lift, maybe. But I just I don't really have any like solid numbers for folklift. That's my problem. With that. 348 00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.760 Jenny Duan: What else do you have the solid numbers for? 349 00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.100 Jenny Duan: You should be at J. Camp. That's like pretty relevant. 350 00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.429 huda: Good. Yeah. 351 00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.320 Jenny Duan: That's like a big thing. 352 00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.060 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 353 00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.010 huda: attendee, or. 354 00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.910 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Attendee, maybe. 355 00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:33.160 huda: But I think 356 00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.259 huda: I think there's a specific category for like summer programs. 357 00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.755 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 358 00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.320 huda: Oh, actually. 359 00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.430 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, I don't think I see it. 360 00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:58.269 huda: Either that or either journalism or career oriented. But I think journalism might work better. 361 00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.899 Jenny Duan: I agree. 362 00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.770 huda: And then 363 00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.200 huda: I think 364 00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:19.430 huda: I also put a lot of time into like the Sunday school. Tain",
    "g. 365 00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 366 00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:30.160 huda: I guess it's only like 2 HA week, but it's like, been really consistent, like I've been doing it for like almost 2 and a half years now, so I think, like. 367 00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.049 Jenny Duan: I think that that should be good. There. 368 00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.739 huda: Or should I put like the name of, like the 369 00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.040 huda: organization. 370 00:40:48.783 --> 00:40:50.350 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that would be good. 371 00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.579 Jenny Duan: And then you can say, like, Sunday school teacher, is your position. 372 00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:11.470 huda: And then I think it's just cultural or religious. I think I think religious. I don't know if it's an option. 373 00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.760 huda: Yeah. 374 00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.489 huda: okay. And then 375 00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.839 huda: I could put 376 00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.180 huda: vocal. Maybe I'm just like putting book here. 377 00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.509 huda: cause I feel like it's more important than 378 00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.399 huda: like women and games.

Then I think the next step is, let's finish the rest of the activities list right now and then.

And then our next meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday. Is that still a good time for you? 625 01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.830 huda: Yeah.

Oh, yeah. But also I forgot to mention at school. They have this opportunity. Called stable talks. Let me see if I can find that email for more details. But it's like a speaking opportunity for 629 01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:46.480 huda: students like 630 01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:56.030 huda: speed. 631 01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:57.630 Jenny Duan: Opportunity.

So 635 01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.229 huda: yeah, I just wanted to add that. 636 01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:20.049 huda: But yeah, I think I didn't really have any questions about Disney dreamers. But 637 01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.210 huda: yeah. 638 01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:28.990 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, sounds good, then.

I just have a few questions. Thank you for your extra time with me today I'm super excited to hear about your 647 01:02:54.190 --> 01:03:18.870 Ivylevel: college preparation journey, and of course, the successes that you've achieved. So I just wanted to spend like 15 to 20 min to have this conversation, which is all about celebrating your hard work and your growth over the past one to 2 years. So let's start with your students journey? I just want to know, like same as before. Can you tell me like a bit about 648 01:03:19.525 --> 01:03:23.340 Ivylevel: when you're in college? Profile? And 649 01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:29.219 Ivylevel: preparation journey when you 1st started working with ivy level, how was it. 650 01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:47.740 huda: Yeah, I think definitely like, when I 1st started working with like Jenny and Ivy level, I think one thing that I noticed that everything was very specific. Because I'v",
    "e like gotten kind of help from like past people from school who got into good colleges. And I think 651 01:03:47.740 --> 01:04:11.588 huda: there's help is not like that specific. And I feel like working with these mentors. And like iv level in general, like, I think everything's been very specific and like they've given me opportunities to apply to. They've helped me with, like the essays specifically. And then also, like working with one one mentor like this whole time has been pretty helpful because 652 01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:25.610 huda: Now she knows, like all my extracurriculars, and she knows about like and like, when I'm thinking of new essay ideas. It's really helpful to be like working with one person, because now she knows, like almost all the things that I do. So yeah, it's really nice. 653 01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:30.959 Ivylevel: I agree, I agree. So. How about what were some of your biggest 654 01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:36.130 Ivylevel: college profile and prep challenges or concerns at the time? At that time? 655 01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:52.435 huda: Yeah, honestly, before iv level, I didn't do much for college prep like so I did do like some volunteering and everything. But I think I didn't really have that. Many solid extracurriculars, especially with like numbers and everything. 656 01:04:52.990 --> 01:05:06.400 huda: especially now, like applying to college. You have to like, think of all the numbers that that you have to input into common app and everything like that. So I think, working with Iv level I've been like able to like focus more on that. 657 01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:30.409 huda: But I also did have a bit of struggles with grades, because I took the sat a couple of times. I I didn't get that many. I didn't get that high of a score. And then I guess my Gpa. Wasn't terrible, but it wasn't like really competitive like, I didn't take that many aps earlier. But I think I started taking like 5 aps in Senior Year 4 Aps and Junior year. So 658 01:05:3",
    "0.410 --> 01:05:40.870 huda: I've definitely been like pushing myself a lot after this. And yeah, I previously was not like that. And so I think that definitely changed. The way I do things. 659 01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:50.910 Ivylevel: Alright, thanks! How about? I'd love to hear about some of your proudest achievements, like what are the top accomplishments that stand out to you? 660 01:05:52.047 --> 01:06:14.532 huda: I think definitely like like for the first, st like I think ever award I won was the Nc. Wit award, and I think that was like my 1st goal with like Jenny as well. And so I think that was like one of my proudest moments. Cause I got the national Honorable Mention, and I honestly didn't think I was gonna get it. So I think that was like one thing I was really proud of. And then 661 01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:34.380 huda: I also, I think another thing was J. Camp, cause I I didn't really like. I just applied for it. Like. With the help of Jenny, of course. But like I, I wasn't really expecting like getting in, because it's a really competitive program, and like, there's so many people that are applied to it like I think, I think 662 01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:45.849 huda: when I 1st heard back from it, like, I think, I got my congratulations email when I was on call with Jenny. So it's pretty cool. It's like on my live live reaction. But yeah, like, I think 663 01:06:46.050 --> 01:07:01.950 huda: it has like a really low acceptance rate, so I wasn't really expecting it, and when I found out I got in it was really cool. And then, like, actually, the whole experience of going to J. Camp was amazing, so I think Nc. Wit and J. Camp have been like my favorite like accomplishments. I've gotten. 664 01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:24.599 Ivylevel: Alright! Thanks! Congratulations on that. We have heard a lot from your from your dad, so I know that your parents are also super proud of you. How about can you tell us more about your significant extracurricular post boost in genera",
    "l, like activities, awards programs, clubs, communities, projects, leadership and etc? 665 01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.495 huda: Yeah, I think 666 01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:31.905 huda: like, you wanna know, like a little bit about what I do or 667 01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:34.380 Ivylevel: Yeah, exactly. 668 01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:58.789 huda: Yeah, so I guess I I do like a lot of mix of like technology and journalism. So I have, like, I founded a nonprofit called empowering AI and I'm sure you've heard about it a lot from my dad as well. But like I do a lot of programs where I can like teach younger girls like, especially in middle school, about like ethics and how technology like 669 01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:15.310 huda: coding works. Basically and then I've also hosted a hackathon underneath empowering AI and I've been able to fundraise. I've kind of talked with some sponsors. I've gotten like people internationally to join. So I think that was like one of like 670 01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:36.989 huda: the most impactful things that I've done. And then I also, I also like made a game developed a game called Synthoria and then I've also like with, along with that game I made like this lesson toolkit, so it can be taught in classrooms, and then distributed that to like a lot of classrooms in the United States. 671 01:08:37.294 --> 01:08:57.075 huda: And I think I'm still kind of continuing that I'm reaching out to more people. But like, yeah, I think that was like my major game development kind of experience. And there's just like a couple of other things like, I I'm like the president of the Filmmakers Club. We do like short films every year, so that was pretty cool. 672 01:08:57.670 --> 01:08:59.910 huda: And then I 673 01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:26.159 huda: I guess I started I recently started tutoring for like this one class at my school for like immigrants who don't really speak English, and like I get to help them out and like, make sure they kind of like have different ta",
    "sks like. For example, they have to describe an image in English, and then I can like help them with words they're stuck on and kind of making sure that they understand. And yeah, that's like. 674 01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:29.189 huda: kind of roughly what I do. But yeah. 675 01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:58.689 Ivylevel: Okay, great. I love the idea of teaching girls in the middle school and also teaching them the English language. I really love that part. Thank you for sharing that. How about can you please share more about your most significant community service or impact? I think that's kind of related to to the teaching part already. But how do you feel? These achievements have impacted your college application profile, so far. 676 01:09:59.951 --> 01:10:23.320 huda: Yeah, I think, like, definitely like, not. It wasn't just that English teaching tutoring thing that I'm doing. It's also like, I get to volunteer at my Sunday local Sunday school at the mosque. So I think that's another like community service that I work on, and that's like, I think, looking at my college application. Now, I think it's definitely helping me a lot, cause it shows kind of like 677 01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:40.119 huda: cause. I feel like. If admissions officers are reading it, they'll know that I'm Muslim, and they might see that aspect of me, because I don't know if that's really clear in, like my essays and everything. So that's 1 way to show my culture and like religion. And also, I think, it's definitely helped me because 678 01:10:40.421 --> 01:11:08.150 huda: the more I do. I'm all actually more eligible for the Presidential service award, and that means like you have to get 250 volunteer hours, and you get an award. And it's like kind of given to you by like the President. I I think it's just like it's like pretty common, but I think it's still a pretty prestigious award, and so I think, like volunteering, for, like the tutoring and then volunteering for the mosque that's like definitely h",
    "elped me. Get closer to that goal. 679 01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:15.860 huda: And yeah, so I think, that's definitely helped me like in college applications. And like a lot of different aspects. 680 01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:27.829 Ivylevel: Great. Okay, how about how do you feel? You've grown or changed as a student going through the college prep. Journey with us with Iv level. 681 01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:37.401 huda: I think there's actually been a lot of change. I think I didn't really see myself as a competitive person. Starting out 682 01:11:37.870 --> 01:12:00.679 huda: especially like before Iv level. I took a lot of easier classes. I wasn't too I guess. Worried about my grades. I mean, I think I tried to maintain better grades, but I think I wasn't as competitive about them. And also I I feel like working with ivy level has like given me a different perspective on, like what I should invest my time on, because 683 01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:12.310 huda: I was thinking like, Oh, should I even like volunteer for this? This new tutoring service, where I can help people who don't speak English. And then I kind of thought about it in a different way, so that, like 684 01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:18.299 huda: cause as an immigrant myself, I think it will be pretty impactful like helping out other immigrants. 685 01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:29.339 huda: So I think that's like I kind of thought about it in that light which I wouldn't have thought about if I wasn't preparing for college. So I think, yeah, I that was like one different thing that I noticed. And 686 01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:38.150 huda: yeah, I think just in general, I've become more competitive and like I guess I value my education a little more than before. 687 01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:47.339 Ivylevel: Okay, how about? I think you have already shared a lot about your volunteering activities. And I think this 688 01:12:48.023 --> 01:13:10.789 Ivylevel: these activities or projects might have contributed a lot to your growth. ",
    "So I just want to confirm if these tutoring activities or teaching activities have really showcased your growth. And if yes, how do you think Iv level or what type of support or resources Iv level did you find most valuable 689 01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:12.270 Ivylevel: for your growth? 690 01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:26.400 huda: Yeah, I think, like, like you said, it's definitely did like contribute to my growth as a student like volunteering. And I think working with Iv level has also been pretty like helpful to that. 691 01:13:26.727 --> 01:13:52.620 huda: Because I've been able to kind of have resources for like how to time manage with, like all these different extracurriculars? And I've also, I've also been able to like prioritize different things like, for example, if at 1 point I think empowering AI is more important than volunteering at the Sunday school. I I'll be able to discuss with Jenny, and then she'll let me know what to prioritize for, like the most impact. 692 01:13:52.973 --> 01:13:58.920 huda: So yeah, I think, just like with Iv level, you can kind of like if they help you like. 693 01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.520 huda: I guess, prioritize different things, and which will help you in the long run. 694 01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:19.799 Ivylevel: And I guess you've mentioned that having a coach or a 1 on one coaching session with Jenny helped you a lot right like he. She knows already. All the works that you've done or what you're currently doing, what activities 695 01:14:20.236 --> 01:14:27.300 Ivylevel: you love or and she can support you a lot, but I want to know as well what's like the most 696 01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:34.359 Ivylevel: loved example of a time. Your coach, or Jenny's guidance made a difference to you. 697 01:14:35.824 --> 01:14:50.439 huda: I think, definitely like this whole process in general. But I think in specific definitely the so many like programs she's introduced me to. I think. They're always so like hyper specific. And they're so li",
    "ke like 698 01:14:50.510 --> 01:15:17.779 huda: fit to who I am. I think, for example, this Disney dreamers program that she introduced me to. It's like they give you. It's kind of like a mix of like leadership journalism, like technology speaking. So it's like kind of like almost everything that I do. So I think she just somehow like finds programs that are very specific and like even J. Camp, like I wouldn't. I didn't know about it, and I wouldn't have applied about it applied to it. 699 01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.599 huda: But like, she just introduced me to like all these really different 700 01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:30.420 huda: programs which are super specific to me. And I think I've said this many times. But like, I think I really appreciate, like how specific, like everything is at Iv level. 701 01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:57.600 Ivylevel: Yeah. And I guess you have an open communication with Jenny. Right? You're like very close to each other since you've been working for quite some time already, and I know that you love each other. What what do you think is like the like? Can you give your most loved moments with your coach. That demonstrated like, you know, relatable, or any empathetic, or the the big difference in your in your journey. 702 01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:24.419 huda: Yeah, I think she's definitely been very empathetic about like, the different applications and things cause sometimes there's so many programs that I have to apply to and like for each of them, you have to write so many different essays, and I think she's definitely been empathetic with that, because sometimes, if I'm not able to meet a deadline, she's able to kind of like connect with me because she's also student, and she knows that there's like a lot of other things to be doing. 703 01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:34.470 huda: So like I think her kind of empathy in that factor has helped me like feel a little bit better, and also, like, been able to apply to more things. 704 01:16:35.466 --> 01:16",
    ":54.743 Ivylevel: Okay, that's great. Thank you so much for that. I know that you know as well that Iv, level's mission is to provide very specific and actionable advice. Right? Can you like share an instance where you received particularly helpful hands on guidance with with Jenny or any other coaches you've encountered. 705 01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:55.930 Ivylevel: yeah. 706 01:16:56.250 --> 01:17:14.389 huda: Yeah. I think with Jenny. In the beginning, we we were applying to bank of America student leaders. It's like a leadership program and so that time we were writing essays. And she gave me very, very specific, like essay ideas. And I kind of told her like my ideas about 707 01:17:15.138 --> 01:17:33.301 huda: I kind of want to talk about like the lack of educational resources at my school, and so she kind of wrote the whole like framework, and I can just like fill in the blanks and like write in my own style. And that's also definitely helped me with, like my my own writing style like. So now, when I'm writing essays 708 01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:45.713 huda: I feel like I'm more able to write by myself, and I don't really need too much of her help now, but, like her specific help in the beginning, was really helpful. To like forming like my writing style now and then 709 01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:57.739 huda: also definitely with coach. Marissa. I think she's a very good essay. Editor, I think. At least, for, like the Stanford, like common app essay. 710 01:17:58.450 --> 01:18:16.569 huda: She just like asked me a couple of questions, and then I was like brainstorming, and she like wrote everything down. And then by the end of that session we came up with like a really good like framework, and I think, like her ability to help me with like coming up with new ideas, was really really shocking. It was really nice. 711 01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:29.960 Ivylevel: Yeah, I'm looking into. I'm looking into your sessions. Every time. And I know that every session is productive,",
    " because I'm also looking into the to your documents and essays. And I can. I can agree that 712 01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:54.520 Ivylevel: they've boosted a lot from you, especially when it comes to ideas, to your essays cause. I also, I also agree that you have a lot of ideas and great ideas in your essays. I I've read a lot of things from your essays, and from the documents that you're sharing with me. So I totally agree with with the qualities of these coaches that you're you're encountering. How about you. I know that you know as well. 713 01:18:54.790 --> 01:19:05.530 Ivylevel: Iv. Level aims to be comprehensive, covering everything from extracurriculars to grades, to test preparations. I just want to know as well how does this approach benefited you? 714 01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:11.621 huda: I think it's yeah, actually like. Previously, when I was preparing for the sat 715 01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.600 huda: I was working with Coach Stephen. 716 01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:18.390 huda: And then I think that's been really really helpful cause 717 01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:37.860 huda: like, even my sister did like sat prep programs. And those were not at all like helpful. And they didn't like help her personally. And I think, I think, sat prep also, with Iv level, was also really different from other sat prep programs, because it's like one once again, like one v, 1 718 01:19:38.784 --> 01:19:44.040 huda: or 1 1 on one sorry and kind of like really specific. 719 01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:54.646 Ivylevel: Like a game one. v. 1 i know you're doing. I mean, I know you're making games. So it's okay. I can understand that I'm playing mobile legends, though. 720 01:19:56.050 --> 01:19:57.070 Ivylevel: Yeah. 721 01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:17.019 Ivylevel: so I still have a few more questions for you, Huda. I'm so sorry if it if it's taking like a a bit more time. So I just want to know did you use any other college prep service before starting with Iv level? Or how do you see us compare",
    "d to other college prep services. 722 01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:27.830 huda: I actually haven't. I think this is like my only one, but like my sister's worked with like some counselors in the past. So I've gone to see how that works. 723 01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.110 huda: And they're definitely a lot less personal. 724 01:20:32.076 --> 01:20:33.110 huda: They're like. 725 01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:46.190 huda: Then they kind of don't encourage you to aim higher, and they don't give you specific help. But like I think, with Iv level, they prepare you to go to like Ivy leagues, whereas, like the counselor is telling my sister to be like more 726 01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:51.359 huda: like realistic. So it wasn't exactly helpful to her. So 727 01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:53.819 huda: I think that's definitely like a major difference. 728 01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.939 Ivylevel: How about what surprised you the most when you joined Ivy level. 729 01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:06.729 huda: I think I was definitely surprised with like, how relatable the coaches are. 730 01:21:07.052 --> 01:21:12.367 huda: Because, like, they're just students as well. And they're like pretty close to my age, and so 731 01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:22.579 huda: I don't know. I feel like we're able to like bond better because of that. And that way. It's like less formal, and I'm able to open up better for my essay. 732 01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:41.050 Ivylevel: And they are also like just fresh to being college right? So they can relate well to you. That's why they are really relatable. But if you could go back and give advice to your like younger self, I know you're still young. But at the start of this journey what would you say. 733 01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.259 huda: I think I'd definitely like, tell her to 734 01:21:45.685 --> 01:21:57.685 huda: be more ambitious and like kind of work on larger projects, cause I think I was really like scared to like, do giant projects. When I was starting out and 735 01:21:58.230 -",
    "-> 01:22:04.279 huda: I could definitely like be benefiting off of like more hard work in the beginning. But yeah. 736 01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:12.789 Ivylevel: How about what's this? What's this one thing that you think that Iv level couldn't have done without or 737 01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.479 Ivylevel: found anywhere else? 738 01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:18.200 huda: I think 739 01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.509 huda: Iv level like 740 01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.475 huda: I think I I might like be reiterating. But I think 741 01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:35.880 huda: this specific help is like the biggest part about Iv level, I think, and like how you can access each mentor pretty much like pretty easily like you can message them 742 01:22:36.373 --> 01:22:45.999 huda: or you can email them like and ask them to just like check over your edits. And then they'll they'll do that. So I think that's like, definitely like a big difference with that B level. 743 01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:57.080 Ivylevel: Right. So, aside from the one on one sessions, you also have the offline support. I think that's what you're you're trying to to pertain. I mean, you're pertaining to right. 744 01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:02.089 Ivylevel: So how do you feel about chances of getting into your dream schools right now? 745 01:23:03.206 --> 01:23:04.430 huda: I think like what. 746 01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:07.459 Ivylevel: Percent. Can you give me like a percentage. 747 01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:11.769 huda: I think like given Stanford's like really competitive and 748 01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:21.651 huda: like, I wouldn't say like, my Gpa is like like the most like competitive out of all of them, and also, like my extracurriculars, aren't like crazy. 749 01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:25.670 huda: I'd say, like Stanford, I probably have like a 750 01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.000 huda: 20. I want. 751 01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.520 Ivylevel: You to be confident. 752 01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:40.939 huda: It's pretty. It's it's pretty",
    " big. But yeah, I I was saying, like, 20% for Stanford and Usc, I think, because, like the program is so like 753 01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:47.279 huda: specific to me, and I don't think it's too popular. I think I have like a higher chance of getting in. So I 754 01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:48.510 huda: probably like 755 01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.279 huda: 50 to 60%. I'll probably get in 756 01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:53.830 huda: for Usc. 757 01:23:54.615 --> 01:23:55.370 huda: and 758 01:23:55.470 --> 01:24:00.370 huda: Berkeley is just. I think it might even be harder than Usd, so 759 01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.400 huda: like 760 01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.138 huda: 25%. I think. 761 01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.670 Ivylevel: Alright! 762 01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:16.609 huda: Grantham, Berkeley, and Irvine. I think there's a like a solid like 40% that I'll get into Irvine 763 01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:24.050 huda: and then for the other, like East Coast colleges like Mit and everything. I think there's a very slim chance, because I'm out of state. 764 01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:25.550 Ivylevel: Okay. 765 01:24:25.670 --> 01:24:28.390 Ivylevel: so what's the 50 to 60%, 766 01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:29.689 Ivylevel: like? Again, you. 767 01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:30.820 huda: The, yeah. 768 01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:47.070 Ivylevel: Okay, that's noted. We'll see. How do you like? If a friend or family was considering getting support from their college prep. In the future with Iv level? Would you refer them to to us? And what would you tell them? Based on your experience? Then. 769 01:24:47.850 --> 01:25:11.390 huda: Yeah, I would definitely refer to Iv level. And I definitely tell them as like a word of advice to kind of make sure that your bond with, like the the mentor that you pick is good because I mean, like I had like different mentors I worked with, and some of them I clicked with better than the others, like in the beginning I worked with Janice 770 01:25:11.735 --> 01:25:38.239 huda: and w",
    "e we didn't click that much like she did a great job in like helping me. Come up with ideas for what I should do, but I think I just don't think we clicked as much. I wasn't able to open up too much around her, and I don't think it was as productive. But when I met with Jenny, I feel like I was able to instantly click and her like opportunities and like relatability, and like kind of things that she provided were like a lot more 771 01:25:38.892 --> 01:25:40.429 huda: I guess, like 772 01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:54.139 huda: similar to like what I do and like I I just felt more connected to her. And so, like, I think I definitely recommend like whoever is joining this new service to make sure like that their bond with like the the mentor is good. 773 01:25:55.020 --> 01:26:13.500 Ivylevel: Right, I agree, and I can totally see that you're really having a great bond with Jenny. Given that you've been working with her for a long time now, and I hope that continues, and it leads you to success. How about do you think there are any areas Iv level could enhance its services. 774 01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:19.310 huda: I think one thing is there's like 775 01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:24.848 huda: a lot of documents like I think I don't know if it's just me. But there's like a lot of documents. 776 01:26:25.130 --> 01:26:28.063 huda: and sometimes I get a bit confused because 777 01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:29.740 huda: like. 778 01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:32.639 huda: for example, there's 1 where it's like 779 01:26:33.116 --> 01:26:45.593 huda: Jenny, Marissa, and Erin. But then there's another one which is just Jenny and Erin, and so like marissa was typing on a separate one. So I was like really confused, but 780 01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:47.140 Ivylevel: Oh, okay. 781 01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:49.330 huda: I think we fixed that, though, I think. 782 01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:53.139 huda: But yeah, like sometimes that's a bit confusing. But 783 01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:54.779 huda: other than that, I ",
    "don't think 784 01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.340 huda: there's Major 785 01:26:56.370 --> 01:26:59.503 huda: feedback. But yeah, like, sometimes 786 01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:08.789 huda: like some of the coaches. They don't like help as much during the essays like, I think it's just like like, for example. Sometimes 787 01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:17.257 huda: I think it's cause, like Jenny feels like I'm like better at writing, so she doesn't need to support me as much. But sometimes I'm like the really lost and 788 01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:31.020 huda: like she's not able to like kind of like. Write a little bit for me. So I think that sometimes like it kind of catches me off guard sometimes. But yeah, I think like she doesn't do that like a lot. It's just sometimes. But yeah. 789 01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:48.500 Ivylevel: Thank you for that. I I really appreciate that comment or feedback in regards to any any experience that could improve. The service of Iv level. I really appreciate it. I just want to know if there's anything else you'd like to share about your journey or experience that we haven't covered right now. 790 01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:54.534 huda: I think I mainly talked about everything. But 791 01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:02.438 huda: yeah, just like I think additional comments is that I think I had a really great experience with Iv level. And 792 01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:13.370 huda: like, yeah, I don't think I've ever had that many like negative like experiences with an Iv level. So I don't really like have any solid like feedback to give cause. I think everything's been pretty smooth. 793 01:28:16.630 --> 01:28:42.930 Ivylevel: Thank you, Huda. I really appreciate all the comments and the time you've put into this I know that we stayed for like almost 30 min here, but I want to thank you so much for your for your journey with me today, and I am really proud of you. For what have you achieved? I I know that those are no, those are not just so so. Awards. I know those. Ev",
    "ery every award that you get is prestigious, I believe, because you've you've 794 01:28:43.389 --> 01:28:58.930 Ivylevel: put efforts into it. You had. I mean, it's all hard work, right? So it just deserves to be paid paid off. So your insights are truly encouraging to us. As we prepare to help more students. Like yourself. 795 01:28:59.241 --> 01:29:15.750 Ivylevel: To to be a part of the Iv level. And as you progress in college prep and applications know that we're all rooting for you, and you've shown incredible growth, I can see that it's it's really visible in in all the documents and in all the awards. And I I know that 796 01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:35.762 Ivylevel: everyone's confident about you. All your coaches, your dad and Iv level itself is confident that you'll ace in the remaining stretch. So we wish you the very best, very best, and I know that you've got this. So if you don't have any questions, or if you have questions, you can always reach out to me, or, you know, to 797 01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:50.700 Ivylevel: through the email or phone number.
