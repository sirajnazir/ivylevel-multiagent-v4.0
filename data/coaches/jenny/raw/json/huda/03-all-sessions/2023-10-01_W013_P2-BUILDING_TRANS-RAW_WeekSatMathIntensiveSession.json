How's it going? 2 00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.859 Jenny Duan: Sorry! I think your like audio might be connected to the wrong thing again, because I can't hear you. 3 00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.400 huda: Can you hear me? 4 00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.259 Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Sounds perfect. 5 00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.130 Jenny Duan: Is just that. How's your week going? 6 00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:53.609 huda: It's going great. So our race started. So I'm just kinda we just sent off my sister back to college. So yeah. 7 00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.320 Jenny Duan: yeah, and what are you planning to do like during the break like any fun plans or just resting. 8 00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.889 huda: I think I'm just gonna like, catch up on studies and like, prepare for the SAT. And stuff, and probably. 9 00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.330 huda: I don't know, I guess. Just like spend more time with my family, I guess. 10 00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for sure. 11 00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:24.499 huda: Umhm. I was wondering if you could make this lesson like kind of more about the sat, since it's like, next weekend. 12 00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.250 huda: Yeah, yeah. 13 00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.919 Jenny Duan: So have you. So I guess 14 00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.820 huda: let's just do like a really quick, maybe 10 min check in, and then we can spend the rest of the time on the SAT. How's that sound? Yeah. 15 00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Could you just really quickly catch me up to date? Let's start with folklift. How's that going? 16 00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.369 huda: Oh, okay. So I secured 17 00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.700 huda: 3 interviews so far like, I haven't gotten to film any of them, cause they they're like backing out 18 00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:03.219 huda: but because, like apparently, there's an event. But this week since this fall break I think there'll be available one of them 19 00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:14.840 huda: like they're kinda they're like nearby. But then like I called them earlier this week, and then they're like giving me the responses, so I can make the script, and I like made the script for one of the 20 00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.230 huda: one of the commercials. 21 00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:34.299 huda: And yeah, like, we're planning to meet like, in the next 2 days. So yeah, like in person. And then, like for the website, I think I've got like the homepage down like, using react? 22 00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.539 huda: yeah. let me just 23 00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.520 huda: yes, like it was just like 24 00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:11.200 huda: I was like learning how to make kinda like react as I as I went through it. But you wanna share your screen. I just wanna see it really quickly. Yeah, I'm just 25 00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.430 huda: I'm gonna quickly open it up real quick. 26 00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.729 huda: I think it should. 27 00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.169 huda: I think loading right now. I can see your screen now. II just see the zoom page, though. 28 00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:20.350 huda: I just like put something for like the meantime. Like I was able to like make it responsive and everything. So that was like kind of like my main focus. This week. I love it. And the design looks so good. Thanks. 29 00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.489 Jenny Duan: Yeah, wow, that's super impressive. 30 00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.510 huda: Yeah, I'm trying to use like components and stuff. So it's like easier for me later, when I'm when I have to update it and everything. So yeah. 31 00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:43.550 Jenny Duan: that's so cool. awesome. Okay? So looks like full full Clift is going. Well. Let's talk about empowering. AI. How's that going for you? 32 00:05:43.650 --> 00:06:05.340 huda: Yeah. So we finish our first tool kit and then we're we're like meeting tomorrow to talk about the web updates with the website, and then I think we're gonna start making like Instagram posts with the interest form and send them out like later today. 33 00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:20.049 huda: so yeah, we're gonna try to circulate at the interest form today. But I was able to make the interest form, and everything like already. So and how's this? How are the slides looking? 34 00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:38.810 huda: So yeah, we're just like our first one. Let me see if we could open it. Actually, we're like making like a practice code as we go on. So like, for example, like we're teaching how to print in the console. We're like having 35 00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.080 huda: like, really basic things on there. 36 00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.410 huda: we 37 00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.049 huda: we're like also trying to make it like kind of fun for. 38 00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.180 huda: and 39 00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.199 you want to share your screen. Maybe. 40 00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.900 huda: Is it sharing, I think. 41 00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.819 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think maybe I either stop sharing. Oh, there we go? 42 00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.099 huda: Oh, looks really good. Did you do this to design yourself? 43 00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:50.770 huda: Yeah, I was just like some easy like, we could like insert like texture or something. Yeah. And then, really good. We're trying to like make it interactive by having like this like like our logo, like, be like our mask, I guess. And then, like, we're gonna have them name the character. And then, like, kind of be like their guide throughout. So 44 00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.290 huda: yeah, so this is like the outline 45 00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.489 huda: and then we explain, like, what is cs. 46 00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:07.249 huda: what is python? And then like. instructions on like how to get into trinket, which is like what we're gonna use to code. 47 00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:19.620 huda: I think this one like we're we're gonna change a little bit. But and then, like, there's printing. And then the output, oh, yeah, we're still working on like 48 00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:31.050 huda: kinda like the other slides. But we have it like written down in our planning sheet like what we're gonna do. Exactly. Wait. That's super cool. I love the 49 00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.280 Jenny Duan: like the color guide that you have like the design guide. 50 00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:42.530 Yeah, we sent this to like, our like other team members. She's the one who's making the website. 51 00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.150 huda: Yeah. 52 00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:51.490 huda: So this is like, we kind of like planned like everything. And then came up with like tasks to do. Yeah. 53 00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.649 Jenny Duan: awesome. And then how's the 54 00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.429 Jenny Duan: A. How's the game going. 55 00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:06.139 huda: Oh, yeah, I think I made like a lot of progress this week because walk me through that. 56 00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:16.779 huda: Yeah. Wait. I think, okay, like it's kinda gonna be slow because it like doesn't do well. And then there's like a lot of things open. But 57 00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:31.010 huda: okay. so yeah, I think II only figured out like how to make kind of like my code, like usable in different parts, so like kind of like prefabs. 58 00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.999 huda: so I can use them like, I kinda like components and like, react like. 59 00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:48.799 huda: so yeah, I was pretty happy with that. And I was able to like start off the game, and like kind of take it to the next, like, connect the scenes together. So yeah, let me just 60 00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.119 huda: wait for it to look 61 00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.760 Jenny Duan: awesome 62 00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.369 huda: case. See? My screen? 63 00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can see your screen now. 64 00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.640 huda: Okay, 65 00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.539 huda: But this is 66 00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.949 huda: this is. 67 00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.599 huda: Think it's 68 00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.660 huda: oh, I don't know. It's not working. 69 00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.740 huda: Okay, wait. Let me just go into the like. The kind of like first seen? 70 00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.870 Jenny Duan: yeah, what? 71 00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:25.040 huda: Thanks. So like, this kind of took me like a while to like set up because I had to like set up like a dialog system, so that, like only if it was like near the person they'd be able to talk. And like, yeah, I think I try to focus more on that today. And then 72 00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:33.960 huda: I think it looks really good. I think it looks really good. 73 00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.280 Jenny Duan: And what remaining progress do you have on the game? 74 00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:47.840 huda: I think definitely like I know, like work on like kind of the rest of the like. The story line, like 75 00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:53.259 huda: like, I have the part down where we're like talking about a classification model. But I need to start like 76 00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.500 huda: working on like the regression model, and also like piecing it together with like. 77 00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:05.459 huda: I guess the lore so like. I think I should focus on 78 00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:16.099 huda: like progressing the storyline. Cause right now, it's just just like the first few scenes. So yeah. 79 00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:34.320 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Okay, awesome. Now. I'm wondering if we can just transition straight to the sat here, because it's like it seems like you kind of have a clear idea of what you need to do. So like, you know, empowering. Yeah. Getting the sign up. List out. Full left getting those interviews done. And then 80 00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:51.849 Jenny Duan: obviously for the game, just continuing, making progress on like the dialogue and opening scenes and things. So I also just wanted to a quick post check on your on the status of your Nc. Where application? I know it's still like, you know, it's due in November, so there's no rush. But like, do you have an update on that at all? 81 00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.370 huda: Yeah. So I finished the second essay, I think. 82 00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:04.179 huda: yeah, I like pieced together like, what we're like discussing last call. And then, like, I kind of 83 00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.250 huda: it's like within 2 50 words. But I don't know if it's like descriptive enough. 84 00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:14.209 huda: But yeah, I think I'm done with a second essay. 85 00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:23.560 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's something we can just put to like, really go over next week. But I think for. Now let's start with knee. 86 00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:32.619 Jenny Duan: Let's start with the SAT. Things. So when was the last time that you took an SAT, and had a tobacco. 87 00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:58.349 huda: I think the last time was actually nic last week. I was able to take one this week because of like like my sister was over and stuff. But like I think I want to take one like right after this call. I'm planning to take one like every day of the week. This week. So yeah, I got a 1480 on that one. But I think I could definitely improve like I think it was 88 00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.220 huda: 7 80 for the 89 00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:13.619 huda: reading and like writing. And then thanks. And then I think it was like I think it was like, just 700 for math. 90 00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:22.979 Jenny Duan: Okay? So I think right now, what we we should work on the most is the math. Do you have that copy of the test in front of you. Maybe we can go for the questions again. 91 00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.690 huda: Yeah, I think it's 92 00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.390 huda: is 93 00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.350 huda: with 94 00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:43.049 huda: version. This is the one that I printed it off so I'll just share my screen. I guess. 95 00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.750 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 96 00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.280 huda: Okay, 97 00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.619 huda: this one. I think I got. 98 00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.960 huda: So 99 00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.500 huda: I think I got this one wrong. 100 00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:49.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, can we start with the no calculator section, actually, and then go to the calculator section from there? Things? 102 00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.589 huda: Oh, wait. 103 00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.819 huda: Think it was 104 00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.549 huda: there was this one one of the ones that I got wrong. 105 00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:47.200 Jenny Duan: Okay, the graph for the function F has 2 X intercepts. So doing this type of question, are you able to find the X intercepts? First of all. 106 00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:52.219 huda: yeah, through the through factoring, I guess. 107 00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So what are the intercepts here? 108 00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.020 huda: wait. Oh, me 109 00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:07.289 huda: annotate. Yeah. You can feel free to annotate the screen. It'll be x plus 4 times x plus one. 110 00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.359 Jenny Duan: And if we turn this into coordinates, what are the intercepts? 111 00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.719 huda: Negative. 4 and negative one. 112 00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.210 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And what's the distance between those? 113 00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.099 huda: 3, 114 00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.329 Jenny Duan: right? 115 00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.329 Jenny Duan: So what confused you with this question? 116 00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:28.960 huda: I think like 117 00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.180 huda: I think 118 00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:45.329 huda: I probably read it wrong, cause I think I thought like it was one of those questions where I was asking. Like how many solutions there were. I think that would have also been an easy fix, but I think it was like one of the last questions I came back to, because I skipped it. 119 00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.379 huda: And yeah, yeah, I guess when you skip a question, what goes through your head when you skip the question. 120 00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:57.250 huda: I kind of like see the ones which have like a lot of like calculating. 121 00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:05.780 huda: I think. But was this a lot of calculating. No, honestly, don't understand why I got this wrong. But 122 00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:35.460 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, yeah. I think our goal, like for the sat is like, you need to really minimize silly mistakes, because that really like impacts your work like it can be easy to be like, oh, you know, like, maybe make one or 2 mistakes. But then you realize, like on the sat, one or 2 mistakes is like 20 points or like 30 points, and that's pretty significant, especially when it comes to the math section, because you already have, like a really really strong meeting writing section. And that's honestly something that so many people are jealous of, because 123 00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:59.979 Jenny Duan: the reading regarding section is honestly the hardest to improve. But that's why it's important for us to get your math lockdown, especially because, since you're going to be applying for Cs, or like Cs adjacent majors, they really wanna see your like math math skill set there. Does that make sense. That's it to make sure that the math is top especially because you're gonna be applying for like Css, adjacent things. And they really care about that? 124 00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.340 Jenny Duan: So yeah, let's go to the next problem. 125 00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.000 huda: Okay? I think this one. 126 00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.450 Jenny Duan: Oh, it looks, it looks like a similar problem. Yeah. 127 00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.540 huda: so 128 00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.100 Jenny Duan: yeah. So you see, that would be 129 00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.570 huda: who? 130 00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.240 huda: times. 131 00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.089 huda: And then u squared minus t squared. 132 00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.360 huda: would I solve for U and T, first. 133 00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.900 Jenny Duan: yeah, so how can you factor this equation? 134 00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.979 huda: This one 135 00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:48.479 huda: wouldn't it be like U minus t, and then U squared minus TU, 136 00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.170 huda: minus t squared? 137 00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.909 Jenny Duan: Can you simplify this at all? 138 00:19:55.030 --> 00:20:00.050 huda: u plus TU, minus t. 139 00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.369 Jenny Duan: there you go. 140 00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.040 huda: Okay? 141 00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:10.079 huda: Oh, okay. So it will be 10. So it'll be 20. 142 00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:31.819 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, okay, here's something about the SAT. All the questions are easier than you think. They're not trying to test your ability to do complex math, because they know that you don't have a lot of time. They're trying to test your ability to reason through things. So whenever you see, like some a complicated expression like that. There's almost always a way to simplify that. 143 00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:43.639 Jenny Duan: So in this case, what they're testing is, I mean, obviously, you can solve for your U and T. And then you can like, do the actual computation. But that's like really computationally challenging. That takes a lot of time. So 144 00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:53.410 Jenny Duan: whenever you feel like you're doing too much work. You're probably doing too much work. So they really want you to find, like the simplest and easiest way to solve a problem cause like 145 00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:00.449 Jenny Duan: the test takers, the test graders. They don't want to spend a lot of time checking over your work, too, like that takes a lot of time. 146 00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:24.899 Jenny Duan: So they just wanna see like that, you're able to find the quickest way to do it. And in this case that would be to do what you just did so like simplify the expression, plug the values in and like they're giving you that information for a reason, right? They wouldn't give you, plus t equals 5 if they didn't want you to use u plus t somewhere in your answer. So that should give you a hint, like all the information they give you, it's there for a reason, and they want you to use it when you 147 00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.590 huda: solve the questions. 148 00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.820 huda: Okay? I mean. 149 00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.749 huda: I'm not sure cause 150 00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.310 huda: I think. 151 00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.310 huda: trying to see which ones I got wrong, cause these aren't like matching up with the ones that 152 00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:53.349 huda: I was having trouble. Maybe it's like a different test. Again. I remember that happened last time. Let me let me check the other ones. Let's see. 153 00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.520 Yeah. 154 00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:37.490 huda: okay, I think this is the one 155 00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:47.020 huda: I think it was this one. 156 00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.800 Jenny Duan: Okay. all this. Okay. so. 157 00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.410 okay, how can you? yeah. 158 00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:11.269 Jenny Duan: okay, approach. Let me know how you would approach this question. Can you walk me through like after seeing this question, what is your first instinct to solve it? 159 00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:19.150 huda: So maybe like so since y is equal to x squared, I do 2 x squared, plus 6 160 00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:25.629 huda: as equal to 2 x plus 6 and then what do you want to write that down? Yeah, perfect. 161 00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.090 Jenny Duan: Right? And then what's next? 162 00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.850 huda: And then you put it to the other side. 163 00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.960 Jenny Duan: Yep. 164 00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.860 huda: think it was 0, right? Yeah. And then you do 165 00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.840 huda: 2 x, and then X, x minus one. 166 00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.880 Jenny Duan: Yeah, equal 0. 167 00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:01.330 Jenny Duan: It's also the same thing as maybe like. 168 00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.109 Jenny Duan: okay, 2 x times x minus one. 169 00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.829 Jenny Duan: So let's go ahead. 170 00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.300 Jenny Duan: Y, let's get the value of x 171 00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.279 huda: so X would equal to 0, or one 172 00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.430 Jenny Duan: right, and y is equal to what? 173 00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:24.690 huda: Oh, it will be either 0 or one. Okay. 174 00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:44.340 Jenny Duan: so how are you doing? So you basically just have the question there. So when you're originally solving it. What confused you about this question, or was there anything that confused you about it? Or was it just like seeing that system of equations and being like, Oh, my gosh! It's so messy. Yeah, that, too. And I just feel like I think this since I took this like 2 weeks ago. 175 00:24:44.340 --> 00:25:00.620 huda: I kinda didn't really like pay attention to like the math section before that. I was kind of like focusing more on the reading section. And I wasn't setting any like cause I read actually, yesterday I read, like the document that you sent, like all of it. 176 00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:16.800 huda: So like I was found. The section about the system of equations definitely simplified it for me. But I think, like the process that I did it in like was kind of different cause. I tried like subtracting or something, but I don't. That's not really the right way to do it. So 177 00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:24.989 Jenny Duan: I mean, after looking at. The explanation that we just worked through. What strategies from this are you going to apply to the next time you see a problem like this 178 00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:33.159 huda: I think like if I see, like like a variable, like getting assigned as one of them, I think substitution would be my first thought. 179 00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:41.930 huda: and then also, like like paying attention to to directions like how it says like access to be greater than 0 180 00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:48.979 huda: and then like, it's x and y? So what question? What answer did you put for this question? 181 00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.910 huda: I think I said, II guessed on this one, actually 3. 182 00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.340 Jenny Duan: Okay, got it. So 183 00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:02.320 Jenny Duan: yeah, let's just do the next. Oh, actually, another thing that you can do. 184 00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:10.180 Jenny Duan: If you have to guess is you can plug in back in. So, for example, if you did 3 well. 185 00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.289 Jenny Duan: if XY is 3, then x has to be like x or y has to be one and 186 00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.890 Jenny Duan: the other one has to be like 3. Right? One of them has to be one, the other one has to be 3. Right? 187 00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.129 huda: Does that make sense. Why, yeah. 188 00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:33.019 Jenny Duan: So if you plug that into, you can quickly see that like 3 is not one squared and one is not 3 squared. So that would just not work. 189 00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:41.730 Jenny Duan: So if you plug it back in like, the only answers that would work are one or 9 if you were to guess. 190 00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.739 Jenny Duan: Actually 9. 191 00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:56.229 Jenny Duan: Not want to work either, because. like, you could try 9 and one or 3 and 3, and like one, and is not 9 squared? 9 is not one squared like 3 is not 3 squared? So the only answer that works is one 192 00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:01.930 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? How you just like went process of elimination. Yeah. 193 00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.340 huda: that's another strategy you can use if you ever get stuck. 194 00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:13.609 huda: So like, most of my incorrect ones are actually from like the calculator section. So let's maybe go there. Next. 195 00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.220 Jenny Duan: are there any more from a calculator or is the leverson calculator 196 00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.469 huda: the rest are all calculator 197 00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.210 huda: if 198 00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.260 well. 199 00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.330 great, wonderful on my. 200 00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.970 okay. 201 00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.740 huda: I think it was, no, I, 202 00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.130 Jenny Duan: yeah. 203 00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.870 huda: wait. 204 00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:02.040 huda: this one, yeah. 205 00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:20.829 Jenny Duan: Number 23. Yeah. Okay, the relationship between the monthly rental price are dollars, and the properties purchase price in thousands of dollars can be represented by a linear function, which is the following functions represent the relation. Okay, so let's look at the graph, right? So, okay. 206 00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:28.529 Jenny Duan: the the relationship between the rental price r and dollars in the properties. Purchase price. P, 207 00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.420 Jenny Duan: okay? 208 00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:41.519 Jenny Duan: So basically, what they're asking you to do is construct a system of equations based on the data that they give you. So how did you approach this question when you first looked at it. 209 00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.840 huda: So I think I did. 210 00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.990 huda: wait. This is 211 00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:58.360 huda: Okay. I think I did like 212 00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.180 huda: rental price to purchase price. 213 00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:12.300 huda: I don't wait. I think 214 00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.940 I did. I like divided them 215 00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:19.239 huda: like the purchase price by the monthly rental price. 216 00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.730 huda: I'm not. Why did you do the division? 217 00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.520 huda: I think to see, like like the 218 00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:33.900 huda: fraction of the price that, like the that, the rental prices compared to the purchase price. 219 00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:47.670 Jenny Duan: Okay, interesting. But remember, it's a linear function, right? So for I think that quite this type of question is actually pretty common. And I think the I'm just gonna walk the strategy to solving this. 220 00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.760 huda: Is that okay? 221 00:29:50.310 --> 00:30:08.639 Jenny Duan: So what they're trying to do is they're trying to have you construct a linear equation based on the data that they're given that they give you in the table. So if you just point, pick 2 arbitrary points like maybe choose to add addresses. Which ones do you want to choose clear water and go in view? 222 00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So now they want you to just construct a system of equations 223 00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.739 Jenny Duan: based on this. So if you have those 2 points like 224 00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.870 Jenny Duan: the monthly rental price in the property's purchase price is 225 00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:28.750 Jenny Duan: so the rental is going to be the the Y value and the properties. Purchase price is the X value. So 226 00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:38.809 Jenny Duan: if you take that like point 128,950 and 140,01040. Can you construct a linear equation based on that? 227 00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:46.739 huda: like, given that, they're x and y. 228 00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.330 Jenny Duan: yeah, like, for example, the 2 points are 229 00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.830 Jenny Duan: 1, 28, 0 0 0 230 00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.370 Jenny Duan: 9 15. 231 00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:04.839 Jenny Duan: And the second point is you chose was this 1 40, 0 0 0 232 00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.799 Jenny Duan: and 1040. Can you 233 00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.410 Jenny Duan: find the system of equations here? 234 00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:13.990 huda: Yeah. 235 00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.189 Jenny Duan: yeah. So why don't you do that? 236 00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.559 huda: You maybe. 237 00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:26.210 huda: would you be able to like? Plug them into one of the answers? 238 00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:33.459 Jenny Duan: Maybe. But in school have you learned how to create a system of equations with 2 points. If you haven't, that's okay. 239 00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:38.449 huda: I think we might have. But like a while ago. So I don't really remember. 240 00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:43.669 Jenny Duan: Okay, no problem. So do you know how to find the slope here? 241 00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.999 huda: Yeah, you do. 242 00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:57.670 huda: Would it be like 10040, I mean 140,000, minus 128,000, over 1,040, minus 9 50. 243 00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.100 Jenny Duan: It's the other way. So it's changing y over change in X. 244 00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.219 huda: Oh, yeah, okay? 245 00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.300 Jenny Duan: so you can use your calculator here, cause this is the calculator section. 246 00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.810 huda: There'll be 247 00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.550 huda: so like 248 00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.559 huda: one over 1, 20. 249 00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So. 250 00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:47.460 Jenny Duan: why don't you calculate that so? Is it 90 over one? 251 00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:49.980 Jenny Duan: Well, yeah. 252 00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.569 Jenny Duan: Can you repeat what you said for the values 253 00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.339 huda: for the coordinates, or the slope 254 00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.630 Jenny Duan: the slope. 255 00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.970 huda: one over 1, 20, 256 00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:12.229 Jenny Duan: one over one. Also remember, it's in thousands, so you can just do 1 40 minus 1 28 instead of 1, 40,000, minus 1 28,000. 257 00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.969 huda: Okay, that should be like 90 over 12, I think. 258 00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:30.459 huda: yeah, 90 over 12. And if you do that division? What do you get? 259 00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.529 huda: you get 7.5. 260 00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.090 Jenny Duan: And what answer does that correspond to? 261 00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.679 huda: And deep? 262 00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:58.529 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's the correct answer. So I think the key strategy that we use right here is just figuring out how to go from the graph for the table to a system to an equation. And then the way that we did that was by finding the slope and then plugging that back in and just identifying the answer with the correct slope. 263 00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.690 huda: Does that make sense? Yeah. 264 00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:08.559 Jenny Duan: okay, amazing. So do you feel confident that you'd be able to do this type of question if presented to you in a different way. 265 00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:14.960 huda: I think maybe I might need like another practice one. something. So much of this, maybe. 266 00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.800 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 267 00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:24.230 Jenny Duan: There, there might not be any other practices in this test. But 268 00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:27.469 Jenny Duan: I can just give you another example. 269 00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.760 Jenny Duan: okay. 270 00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:35.179 Jenny Duan: let me just annotate the screen again. So 271 00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:39.219 Jenny Duan: okay, let me just make you a table with some values. 272 00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:58.410 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest thing is just finding this is like the system. Look like the equation that satisfies it. So if you have these points like 14, 5, 3, 8. Can you find the systems of equations here or the slope here? 273 00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.970 huda: I can't do the annotations. But yeah. 274 00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.510 Jenny Duan: oh, you can't see the annotations 275 00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.960 huda: sure. okay, I can see them now 276 00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:22.570 huda: yeah, i'd be able to make one, so maybe 8 minus 5, which is 3 over. 277 00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.090 huda: 3, minus 14 278 00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.110 huda: and 279 00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:38.979 Jenny Duan: and what is that 8, minus 5, divided by 3, minus 14, negative, 3, over 11. 280 00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, amazing sounds perfect. 281 00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.930 Jenny Duan: so 282 00:35:45.380 --> 00:36:03.450 Jenny Duan: there you go with the slope. And I think that the biggest thing is then just fitting in the slope to the word problems. So do you feel confident with, like the wording of the problems? Or is that what you're confused by the most? What would you say, yeah, I think the wording is like the most confusing part cause 283 00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:16.290 huda: like II think it. Kinda I felt like it was asking me like what the price of the like. The purchase is in comparison to the the rental which is not really the case. 284 00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:44.929 Jenny Duan: right? So I think the thing that we need to notice is the question like which of the so the note that it can be represented by a linear function? I think that that's like the highlight. Because if you're doing a linear function, then you really don't need to be dividing like the X by the Y values, right? Because that would be like an inverse function. That wouldn't be a linear function. And so if you're looking for the relationship between the rental price and the properties. Purchase price then, and then asking for a linear function. Then I mean. 285 00:36:44.930 --> 00:37:02.410 Jenny Duan: when you see that keyword linear, I think, moving forward so like keyword, linear, just think, okay, linear. That means find slope like Sis, find the equation. So I think that with that framework in mind, like, if you see the keyword like linear function. Then you'll know how to then you'll know to 286 00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.649 Jenny Duan: do exactly that, to like find the slope and to 287 00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.430 Jenny Duan: make make the equation from that? Does that make sense? 288 00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.390 huda: Yeah. 289 00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.610 Jenny Duan: okay, amazing. 290 00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.079 Jenny Duan: Okay, what's the next question. 291 00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.580 huda: this one. 292 00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:52.639 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. A psychologist set up an experiment to say, the tendency of a person to select the first item in the in the experiment of probability, 300 people were presented with a set of 5 pictures arranged in a random order. Each person is asked to choose the most appealing picture. Now the first 150 participants, 36 chose, chose the first picture in the set among the ratings, 1, 50 participants. PP. People chose the first picture in the set of more than 20%. Okay. 293 00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:57.280 Jenny Duan: of the first. 294 00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.630 okay. 295 00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.989 of the remaining 5 and 150 participants. 296 00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.280 Jenny Duan: P people, if more than 20%. 297 00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:20.059 Jenny Duan: that if more than 20%. People chose the first pupil on this. Okay, so I think this is about just keeping track of all the information that's given to you. So 298 00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.109 Jenny Duan: we can start by doing a problem like this 299 00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.489 Jenny Duan: by sort of identifying all 300 00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.429 Jenny Duan: Gen. So in this experiment, we know that 301 00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:33.460 Jenny Duan: 300 people, to the total number of people is 300. Does that make sense? 302 00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.710 huda: Hmm. 303 00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.269 Jenny Duan: so that's the first piece of information that we're given. 304 00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:44.129 huda: Can you tell me what the second piece of information we're given is then we're given 305 00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:50.670 huda: of the first 1, 50 participants. So like half of the people. 306 00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.039 huda: From that 307 00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.910 huda: 36 people chose a picture. 308 00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:03.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, ex, exactly. So. Right now, we already know that like 36 people have chosen the picture right? 309 00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.179 Jenny Duan: Just first picture 310 00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.920 36 people chose. Picture one. 311 00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.839 Jenny Duan: My screen's freezing. 312 00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.180 Jenny Duan: 36 313 00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.580 Jenny Duan: chose picture one, okay. 314 00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:32.210 Jenny Duan: and then as the remaining 1, 50 participants. P people chose the first picture. 315 00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.510 Jenny Duan: So now we're looking for how many people 316 00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:42.080 Jenny Duan: chose the first picture. So if more than 20% of all participants chose the first picture. 317 00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.830 Jenny Duan: Okay, so you know. 318 00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:58.910 Jenny Duan: okay. So we know that more than 20%. Of people chose the first picture, and of the remaining P. People chose of the remaining. P people chose the first picture. 319 00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:03.889 Jenny Duan: so what is the total number of people who chose the first picture? 320 00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.949 huda: That would be like 20% of 300. So that would be 321 00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:19.370 Jenny Duan: not exactly right, because we know that more than 20%. But we don't know that 20% of people chose the first picture. Does that make sense? Oh, okay, so we know that 322 00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:26.129 of the remaining among the remaining 1 50 P people chose the first picture, and of the first 1, 50, 36, chose the 323 00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.010 Jenny Duan: first picture. So what's the total number of people who chose the first picture? 324 00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.350 huda: 36 plus P. 325 00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.810 Jenny Duan: Exactly perfect. 326 00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.970 Jenny Duan: So P. Plus 36 people, right? Chose the first picture right? 327 00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:48.079 Jenny Duan: And we know that more than 20%. Of all the people chose the first picture. Right? 328 00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.350 huda: so 329 00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.799 Jenny Duan: does this give you the correct answer, now. 330 00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.429 huda: okay, so it would be d 331 00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.229 Jenny Duan: amazing yeah. 332 00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.370 huda: does that make sense yeah for sure. 333 00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.150 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So what kind of confused you about this specific question? 334 00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:10.129 huda: I think, like kind of dealing with, like all these values like, it was kind of confusing, because 335 00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:29.609 huda: first, it's like half of the 300 are chosen and then 36 from that are chosen. And then I think I kinda got confused with like like the 20. I think I kinda disregarded this like more than part and then, like I guess 336 00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:36.240 huda: I thought it was equal to 2, 20%. And then I think I ended up choosing 337 00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:44.709 huda: this one. II didn't really make sense. So now that we talk through it. But yeah. 338 00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.719 Jenny Duan: awesome. So do you feel like, 339 00:41:48.870 --> 00:42:07.359 huda: the strategy that we use by identifying all the important information? Do you feel like that makes sense to you. I think I think I need to like start annotating like my math section. More cause. Usually I just like don't really annotate my math section that much and kinda like mainly do all my reading. But I think it's important for math as well. 340 00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.200 Jenny Duan: Cool. Yeah. Okay, can we look at the next question. 341 00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.370 huda: oh, yeah. I was. 342 00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:16.680 huda: wait. 343 00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.720 huda: Who was this one 344 00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.020 Jenny Duan: okay. 345 00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.949 surface area of a, cube is 6, times a over 4, where it is a positive constant. 346 00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:35.490 Jenny Duan: So what? Which gives the parameter of one face of the queue? Okay, so this is a easy question. Disguise as a hard question. So 347 00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:41.859 Jenny Duan: the wording of this makes it look super confusing. But can you tell me like, how do you find the surface area of a queue? 348 00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.529 huda: It's like 6 times like the 349 00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.609 huda: the area of one's like, square. 350 00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 351 00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:57.590 Jenny Duan: So 6 times like a squared right, if 80 is one of the sidelines, right. 352 00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:03.129 huda: well, we'll just call this like, be okay. Cause this is oh, my gosh, that's so messy 353 00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:09.859 Jenny Duan: 1, s, 6, b, squared, where b is like the side of the side of the queue. Right? 354 00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.910 Jenny Duan: So, okay. Oh, my gosh, sorry. 355 00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.340 Jenny Duan: There you go. So this is B right one side. 356 00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.310 huda: Yeah. Can you tell me what the perimeter of one face of the cube is 357 00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.199 huda: like in terms of height and length. 358 00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.050 huda: I mean heightened width 359 00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.100 in terms of being 360 00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:38.419 huda: one of the sides. 361 00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.730 Jenny Duan: you'll know. 362 00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.590 Jenny Duan: Rider of one face of the cube. 363 00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:43.480 Hello. 364 00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:49.250 huda: let me. 365 00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.320 huda: I like. So, okay, so B, is, this is like 366 00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.260 huda: this 367 00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:56.870 huda: being amazing. 368 00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:10.849 Jenny Duan: One side, because, remember, 6 B squared is the area 6 B squared is the total surface area. But B is the side length right, because the surface area of one side is B squared. So B is the length of one of the sides. Okay. 369 00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.780 huda: so be a perimeter of the face. 370 00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:15.250 huda: it'll be 371 00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.219 huda: B times 4, yeah, so 4 b right, 372 00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.959 Jenny Duan: so so we know that if this is a surface area, then this is the perimeter right? 373 00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:36.049 Jenny Duan: okay, so then, if this is the side length, if a over 4 is our new b then what is 4 374 00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.720 Jenny Duan: times a over 4, 375 00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.920 huda: a. 376 00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.100 Jenny Duan: And that's the correct answer. 377 00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.320 huda: Oh, okay. 378 00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:46.949 does that make sense? 379 00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.980 huda: Oh, okay, I don't know. so 380 00:44:52.910 --> 00:45:01.069 huda: okay, so it's asking for the perimeter of one face of the queue. Okay, that makes like a lot more sense cause 381 00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:15.999 Jenny Duan: I think I was. I think I was solving, for, like the volume of the queue. I don't know what what's happening, but I think the key is just. I feel like all these questions. I think you totally understand how to do them. I think the confusion, maybe, is just like 382 00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.550 Jenny Duan: the 383 00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:34.539 huda: the process, like when you do them. I think you maybe you missed the what the questions actually asking you, or you tend to do rush. Do you feel like, yeah, I feel like, definitely like the the math section like towards the end. So it's kinda like long. So like, I kinda rush through those. 384 00:45:35.260 --> 00:46:00.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think training like your ability to focus. And like, just, I know that the test is really long. But that's another thing. They're just training you like your ability to just sit down and like do it. And I think that's why, like doing the practice test as if they were a real exam is what's the most helpful? Because on a real exam like, you're ideally not rushing through the end of the exam. And I think on the practice exam, it's best to try to avoid doing that as well. 385 00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:05.779 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay, awesome. Can we go to the next question. 386 00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:12.680 huda: okay, okay. 387 00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.599 huda: I think it was this one 388 00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:25.050 Jenny Duan: very cool. And oh, we went. We went ahead like back to the beginning of the test. 389 00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.520 huda: Yeah, I just realized that like, I missed this one. 390 00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:29.740 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool 391 00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:35.509 Jenny Duan: the D pier. Plants increases its membership by a total of 10 businesses a year. 392 00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.900 Jenny Duan: There were B businesses in the beginning of the year. 393 00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.450 Jenny Duan: Okay? 394 00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:49.140 Jenny Duan: First of all, what type of equation are you expecting exponential or linear 395 00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:55.870 huda: a linear. 396 00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that means we can eliminate c and d right 397 00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.490 Jenny Duan: And what's the difference between option a and option, b. 398 00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:19.169 huda: I think B like subtracts with the amount of business that he had in the beginning. and then a adds its own. A, I think correct. 399 00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.650 huda: Yeah, how much time does that take you like 30 s? 400 00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.320 Jenny Duan: What was confusing about this question? 401 00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:38.660 huda: I think I really assume that it was exponential, I think, never make an assumption. I have no idea. I don't know cause 402 00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:49.079 huda: I think I was like practicing like exponential questions before that. So I don't know. Okay, Gotcha, remember. Never make an assumption. 403 00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:55.460 Jenny Duan: Always use the information that the test gives you to solve it. Cool. What's the next one? 404 00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:00.059 huda: Let me go ahead over here. Think. 405 00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.879 huda: oh, yeah. Okay. 38. 406 00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:25.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. So if Miss Simon starts her drive at 6 30, she can drive about her average driving speed. Okay, one thing is, don't be intimidated. When a problem has a lot to words is, remember this, your reading section is really good. You know you have good reading comprehension, so there's no need to be worried. Some people they have bad reading 407 00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:47.350 Jenny Duan: friends. They need to be worried. But that's not the case for you. You don't need to be worried. Just approach the the question, even if it has a lot of words. So if Miss Simon starts to drive at 6 30 A. M. She can drive her average people with no traffic if she starts to drive at 7. Ok, the first thing I do when I look at this type of question is, I look at what the question is asking. So what is the actual thing that it's asking, based on the table. How many 408 00:48:47.380 --> 00:49:01.569 Jenny Duan: in more minutes does Miss Simon take to arrive at her work place if she starts her drive at 7, than if she starts her drive at 6 30. So what they're asking you to do is to calculate her drive at 7 and her drive at 6 30, and then look at the time difference it takes. 409 00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.320 Jenny Duan: It's between those 2. 410 00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.589 huda: Does that make sense? Yeah. 411 00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:14.930 Jenny Duan: okay, so we can just start with calculating her time at 6 30. So she says, to drive at 6 30 with no traffic. How long does it take her to drive? 412 00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:23.509 huda: okay, so that would be 413 00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.879 huda: okay. So she's traveling point 6 miles at 414 00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.729 huda: 25 miles per hour. 415 00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.600 huda: so that we 416 00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.450 huda: 25 divided by point 6. 417 00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:43.950 huda: Oh, no, not I mean 418 00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.800 huda: point 6, divided by 25. 419 00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:55.670 Jenny Duan: okay, continue. 420 00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:57.300 huda: And then 421 00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.439 Jenny Duan: have you taken physics at the school by the way. 422 00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:02.830 huda: oh, yeah. 423 00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.970 Jenny Duan: yeah, awesome, continue. 424 00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:17.490 huda: yeah, so time is equal to distance over speed. Right? Yeah. loss per hour. And then so that was point 0 0 2 4. 425 00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:21.750 Jenny Duan: And then what you add what this? And then this right 426 00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.050 huda: sorry. Wait. 427 00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.360 huda: Yeah. And then you do 428 00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:29.269 huda: 50 429 00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:35.600 huda: and develop. and I mean, sorry. 430 00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:48.970 huda: And then you do 15.4 divided by 50, which is 431 00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.860 huda: 0 point 3 0 8. 432 00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.020 huda: And you add right to what you got before yeah. 433 00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:02.890 huda: oh, it was a previous value for that? 434 00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.620 huda: Oh, yeah, so 0 point 0 2 4 and 435 00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.040 huda: plus 436 00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:27.280 huda: 0 point 3, 0 8 plus 437 00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:29.420 huda: and 438 00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.149 huda: 1.4 divided by 439 00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:41.230 huda: 3 5 is 0 point 0 4 which is 0 point 3 7 2, 440 00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.150 Jenny Duan: and could times that by 60 right to get minutes. 441 00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.950 huda: And then you get 22.3 2. 442 00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.430 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah. 443 00:51:52.450 --> 00:52:07.430 Jenny Duan: So, okay, now, all you need to do is all you need to do is calculate the travel time from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit, because, remember, you already have the 2 values from the freeway home to the freeway entrance and from the freeway exit to the workplace. 444 00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:16.579 Jenny Duan: So you know that the travel time from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit increases by 33. What does that mean for the number that you had calculated there. 445 00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:25.079 huda: oh, so that means like, we're going to have to multiply 1.3 3 446 00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:28.419 huda: times like the amount of minutes that it took. 447 00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:38.700 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for the middle value, only right? Because it's only the travel time from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit. Right? So if you multiply that by that, then what is the difference? 448 00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.680 huda: And 449 00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.849 huda: it will be 450 00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:15.460 huda: like in minutes it will be 6.0 9 8 4, 451 00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.360 Jenny Duan: yeah, 0 point 6 and 8, 4 min or hours 452 00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:23.040 huda: a minute. 453 00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:28.540 Jenny Duan: hmm! Let me do some calculation. 454 00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.730 Jenny Duan: 1 s. 455 00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:38.909 Jenny Duan: 15.4 250 times 60. That's no. And I and combined, I was like. 456 00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.110 huda: in total 457 00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:43.619 huda: like all the other values as well. 458 00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, both. What we're trying to find is, see? 459 00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.079 Jenny Duan: Yeah, the difference between the time from the freeway exit to the freeway 460 00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:59.419 Jenny Duan: from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit. So read 15.4 4 15.4, divided by 50 U right 461 00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:06.659 Jenny Duan: times 1.3 right. and then time 16, and then minus whatever value you had before. 462 00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:10.330 huda: And 463 00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:40.110 Jenny Duan: so actually, there's what we're doing right now is kind of a longer way to do it. But there's actually like a much simpler and easier way. 464 00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:47.520 huda: Do you want me to just tell you what that is. Or would you like to finish doing it this way? First? I'd like a shorter way, if that's possible. 465 00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:56.119 Okay, so you know that the distance from the freeway home to the freeway entrance and the freeway exit to the work place. You know that that time doesn't change right? 466 00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:08.300 huda: Oh, yeah. So the only thing that changes is that the entrance to the freeway from the the travel time, from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit increases by 33%. Right? 467 00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:20.189 Jenny Duan: so all you need to do is calculate what that 33% of time is so all you to do is do Let me write on the screen 15.4 times 0 point 3 3 468 00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:23.960 Jenny Duan: right to find 33% of that 469 00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:26.549 Jenny Duan: divided by fiftieth right? 470 00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:30.710 Jenny Duan: And that whole thing times 16. That's the answer. 471 00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.760 huda: Oh, okay, that was quick. 472 00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:45.229 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense to you, though? Cause I the reason we went with the longer we first is cause. I wanted you to understand the concept before going to the shorter one. But does this concept make sense to you. Why, we can just do that. 473 00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:53.699 huda: So would it be like the same thing if we did 15.4, divided by 50 times 0 point 3 3. 474 00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.979 Jenny Duan: Yeah, same thing. Time 60. 475 00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.300 huda: Okay. okay, that makes sense. Then. 476 00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:05.229 Jenny Duan: okay, so now, I actually want you to explain this problem to me in your own words. 477 00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:12.529 huda: Okay? So so pretend, like, I don't know how to do this question. I'm seeing you on the sat. How would you explain this? 478 00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:17.880 huda: Okay? So we can see here that a. 479 00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:44.919 huda: We have to compare the 2 times of when, if she starts her drive at 6, 30, and at 7 am so at 6 30 she'll have like this normal time. With all these added but for 7 am. The amount of travel time from just this part is increased by thirty-second threer, I mean, not 30 s. 33% 480 00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:50.880 huda: and these 2 stay the same. 481 00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.280 huda: hmm, so 482 00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:57.419 huda: we wanna know how many minutes how many more minutes? 483 00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:02.120 huda: so to find this, we can do 15.4, divided by 484 00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:05.340 huda: 50 to find 485 00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.169 huda: And this is to find like 486 00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:15.120 huda: how many, I guess hours like what decimal hours? 487 00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:21.250 huda: you it takes to like drive that distance? which is. 488 00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:24.740 huda: which is 0 point 3 1 489 00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.339 huda: 0 point 3 1 and then 490 00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.939 huda: you wanna div. Then you wanna divide. 491 00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:39.049 huda: Oh, you know. Now you want to multiply that number 492 00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:43.539 huda: 0 point 3 one by 493 00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:56.800 huda: by 0 point 3 3, which is like the percentage that it increases. Like, I guess we're trying to find the 33% that it increases and then we're gonna multiply that 494 00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.500 huda: by 6 495 00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:06.809 huda: a 60 to find like the amount of minutes. And we get 6.1 3 8 0 0. 496 00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:12.089 Jenny Duan: And if we round to the nearest minute, which is 6 min 497 00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.250 Jenny Duan: perfect. 498 00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:28.499 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So the reason why I asked you to explain. That is because when you explain something out loud, it helps you like work through the gaps in your understanding, and then also helps you remember better. So, yeah, that makes sense. Does that make sense to you? Now? 499 00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.480 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. Was that the last question. 500 00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.979 huda: Let me just check and cool. 501 00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.470 huda: Okay, so this one 502 00:58:42.790 --> 00:59:12.129 huda: I like I got it correct. But like honestly, I'm not really sure how it's like, I, kinda wanna go like how to do this problem. Okay? Awesome. I'm technical at 6 pm. But I think we can just go over this really quickly. Then, if you have any additional questions after the sessions over, you can text me, and I can like annotate a drawing and send that to you. So my P is the center. What is the value of X, so we know that this is 20 degrees and 20 degrees and 503 00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.920 Jenny Duan: And 504 00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:31.810 Jenny Duan: what do we know about a quadrilateral? What is the number of angles in a quadrilateral? This is the approach that you need to take? So you know that, like, for example, a triangle 1 80 degrees quadrilateral, quadrilateral, 3 60 degrees. That's just something that you should just remember 505 00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:48.220 Jenny Duan: 360 degrees. Because if you think about it like a square, 4 90 degree angles does add up to 3 60 degree. So quadrilateral, 3 3, 60 degrees. Does that make sense. Another thing right now that we notice is, if we go through this circumference of the circle. 506 00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:52.609 Jenny Duan: this angle is going to be one half X, because these 507 00:59:53.330 --> 01:00:14.889 Jenny Duan: okay, this, this kind of unclear. But this is one half x, because you know that. These 2 angles are the same like the angles. B and C are both the same. So you know this is going to be one half of what's going through the radius, because whenever in a circle. You go through the circumference in the radius from the same points on the other side of the circle. It's gonna be just one half. 508 01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.600 and that's just like 509 01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.829 Jenny Duan: a geometrical fact that I guess you have to remember. Unfortunately. 510 01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.080 So if this is 20 and this is 20, and you know that 511 01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:33.919 Jenny Duan: this is going to be one half x, and this is going to be X, then we can say that 3, 60 minus 40 is going to be 320 degrees right? And then 300 512 01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:38.840 Jenny Duan: and 20 degrees is actually 513 01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.620 Jenny Duan: think this might be an easier way to 514 01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:52.079 Jenny Duan: okay. So you know, 320 degrees is the rest of the shape. Right? And 515 01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.600 Jenny Duan: let's see. So 516 01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:01.909 Jenny Duan: okay, what you need to do is now we know that 2 x 517 01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:07.230 Jenny Duan: plus 3, 16. Sorry 518 01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.880 Jenny Duan: x plus. 519 01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.820 Jenny Duan: Let me just text, write this on text 520 01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:20.880 Jenny Duan: x plus 3, 60 minus 2 x is equal to 3, 20. Does this make sense, or is this confusing? 521 01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:34.940 Jenny Duan: Because you know that this is like one half x. So this is x as 2 X, and you know that you know the entirety of this angle is 3, 68 degrees. So the angle p is gonna be 3, 60 minus 2 x is equal to 3, 20. 522 01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:43.289 Jenny Duan: So then we can stay like X, negative x plus 3, 60 is equal to 3, 20, right 523 01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.560 huda: so negative X is equal to negative 40. So X is equal to 4 degrees. Does that make sense? 524 01:01:50.140 --> 01:02:07.269 Ivy Mentors: Okay, cool. So I'm sorry if that was his feed run. If you have any other questions about that, just text me and I'll send you an explanation. But I do have to hop off now, because I have another thing going on. Thanks a lot I appreciate. I mean, we can quickly connect on the you know. Chat but I truly appreciate being the extra time. Thanks so much. 525 01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.889 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, no problem. And good luck with your sat. 526 01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:36.789 Jenny Duan: And remember to read each question carefully, because, as you were going through all the questions. What we realized, remember is, you're able to get all the questions within like 30 s. Like most of the questions we talked about, you know how to do. It wasn't like you didn't know how to do them right. So the key is, take your time. Work slowly. Be mindful of the clock and read every question, identify all the important information, and then just solve it with no rushing. 527 01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:58.300 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest issue is you to rush. But I think if you slow down and just take your time and identify all the key information and what the question is asking, you should be able to do good, too. Yeah, I think one more point would be good before the exam, just to get that model boost, and you know, final kind of preparation, but I truly appreciate. I mean you can. You can hop on to the other thing connect.",

How's it going? 2 00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.859 Jenny Duan: Sorry! I think your like audio might be connected to the wrong thing again, because I can't hear you. 3 00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.400 huda: Can you hear me? 4 00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.259 Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Sounds perfect. 5 00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.130 Jenny Duan: Is just that. How's your week going? 6 00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:53.609 huda: It's going great. So our race started. So I'm just kinda we just sent off my sister back to college. So yeah. 7 00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.320 Jenny Duan: yeah, and what are you planning to do like during the break like any fun plans or just resting. 8 00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.889 huda: I think I'm just gonna like, catch up on studies and like, prepare for the SAT. And stuff, and probably. 9 00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.330 huda: I don't know, I guess. Just like spend more time with my family, I guess. 10 00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for sure. 11 00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:24.499 huda: Umhm. I was wondering if you could make this lesson like kind of more about the sat, since it's like, next weekend. 12 00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.250 huda: Yeah, yeah. 13 00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.919 Jenny Duan: So have you. So I guess 14 00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.820 huda: let's just do like a really quick, maybe 10 min check in, and then we can spend the rest of the time on the SAT. How's that sound? Yeah. 15 00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Could you just really quickly catch me up to date? Let's start with folklift. How's that going? 16 00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.369 huda: Oh, okay. So I secured 17 00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.700 huda: 3 interviews so far like, I haven't gotten to film any of them, cause they they're like backing out 18 00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:03.219 huda: but because, like apparently, ther",
    "e's an event. But this week since this fall break I think there'll be available one of them 19 00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:14.840 huda: like they're kinda they're like nearby. But then like I called them earlier this week, and then they're like giving me the responses, so I can make the script, and I like made the script for one of the 20 00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.230 huda: one of the commercials. 21 00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:34.299 huda: And yeah, like, we're planning to meet like, in the next 2 days. So yeah, like in person. And then, like for the website, I think I've got like the homepage down like, using react? 22 00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.539 huda: yeah. let me just 23 00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.520 huda: yes, like it was just like 24 00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:11.200 huda: I was like learning how to make kinda like react as I as I went through it. But you wanna share your screen. I just wanna see it really quickly. Yeah, I'm just 25 00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.430 huda: I'm gonna quickly open it up real quick. 26 00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.729 huda: I think it should. 27 00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.169 huda: I think loading right now. I can see your screen now. II just see the zoom page, though. 28 00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:20.350 huda: I just like put something for like the meantime. Like I was able to like make it responsive and everything. So that was like kind of like my main focus. This week. I love it. And the design looks so good. Thanks. 29 00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.489 Jenny Duan: Yeah, wow, that's super impressive. 30 00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.510 huda: Yeah, I'm trying to use like components and stuff. So it's like easier for me later, when I'm when I have to update it and everything. So yeah. 31 00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:43.550 Jenny Duan: that's so cool. awesome. Okay? So looks like full full Clift is going. Well. Let's talk about empowering. AI. How's that going for you? 32 00:05:43.650 --> 00:06:05.340 huda: Yeah. So we finish our first tool kit and then we're we're l",
    "ike meeting tomorrow to talk about the web updates with the website, and then I think we're gonna start making like Instagram posts with the interest form and send them out like later today. 33 00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:20.049 huda: so yeah, we're gonna try to circulate at the interest form today. But I was able to make the interest form, and everything like already. So and how's this? How are the slides looking? 34 00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:38.810 huda: So yeah, we're just like our first one. Let me see if we could open it. Actually, we're like making like a practice code as we go on. So like, for example, like we're teaching how to print in the console. We're like having 35 00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.080 huda: like, really basic things on there. 36 00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.410 huda: we 37 00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.049 huda: we're like also trying to make it like kind of fun for. 38 00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.180 huda: and 39 00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.199 you want to share your screen. Maybe. 40 00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.900 huda: Is it sharing, I think. 41 00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.819 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think maybe I either stop sharing. Oh, there we go? 42 00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.099 huda: Oh, looks really good. Did you do this to design yourself? 43 00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:50.770 huda: Yeah, I was just like some easy like, we could like insert like texture or something. Yeah. And then, really good. We're trying to like make it interactive by having like this like like our logo, like, be like our mask, I guess. And then, like, we're gonna have them name the character. And then, like, kind of be like their guide throughout. So 44 00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.290 huda: yeah, so this is like the outline 45 00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.489 huda: and then we explain, like, what is cs. 46 00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:07.249 huda: what is python? And then like. instructions on like how to get into trinket, which is like what we're gonna use to code. 47 00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:19.620 huda:",
    " I think this one like we're we're gonna change a little bit. But and then, like, there's printing. And then the output, oh, yeah, we're still working on like 48 00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:31.050 huda: kinda like the other slides. But we have it like written down in our planning sheet like what we're gonna do. Exactly. Wait. That's super cool. I love the 49 00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.280 Jenny Duan: like the color guide that you have like the design guide. 50 00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:42.530 Yeah, we sent this to like, our like other team members. She's the one who's making the website. 51 00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.150 huda: Yeah. 52 00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:51.490 huda: So this is like, we kind of like planned like everything. And then came up with like tasks to do. Yeah. 53 00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.649 Jenny Duan: awesome. And then how's the 54 00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.429 Jenny Duan: A. How's the game going. 55 00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:06.139 huda: Oh, yeah, I think I made like a lot of progress this week because walk me through that. 56 00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:16.779 huda: Yeah. Wait. I think, okay, like it's kinda gonna be slow because it like doesn't do well. And then there's like a lot of things open. But 57 00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:31.010 huda: okay. so yeah, I think II only figured out like how to make kind of like my code, like usable in different parts, so like kind of like prefabs. 58 00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.999 huda: so I can use them like, I kinda like components and like, react like. 59 00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:48.799 huda: so yeah, I was pretty happy with that. And I was able to like start off the game, and like kind of take it to the next, like, connect the scenes together. So yeah, let me just 60 00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.119 huda: wait for it to look 61 00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.760 Jenny Duan: awesome 62 00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.369 huda: case. See? My screen? 63 00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can see your screen now. 64 00:10:21.130 --> 0",
    "0:10:22.640 huda: Okay, 65 00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.539 huda: But this is 66 00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.949 huda: this is. 67 00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.599 huda: Think it's 68 00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.660 huda: oh, I don't know. It's not working. 69 00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.740 huda: Okay, wait. Let me just go into the like. The kind of like first seen? 70 00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.870 Jenny Duan: yeah, what? 71 00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:25.040 huda: Thanks. So like, this kind of took me like a while to like set up because I had to like set up like a dialog system, so that, like only if it was like near the person they'd be able to talk. And like, yeah, I think I try to focus more on that today. And then 72 00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:33.960 huda: I think it looks really good. I think it looks really good. 73 00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.280 Jenny Duan: And what remaining progress do you have on the game? 74 00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:47.840 huda: I think definitely like I know, like work on like kind of the rest of the like. The story line, like 75 00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:53.259 huda: like, I have the part down where we're like talking about a classification model. But I need to start like 76 00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.500 huda: working on like the regression model, and also like piecing it together with like. 77 00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:05.459 huda: I guess the lore so like. I think I should focus on 78 00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:16.099 huda: like progressing the storyline. Cause right now, it's just just like the first few scenes. So yeah. 79 00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:34.320 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Okay, awesome. Now. I'm wondering if we can just transition straight to the sat here, because it's like it seems like you kind of have a clear idea of what you need to do. So like, you know, empowering. Yeah. Getting the sign up. List out. Full left getting those interviews done. And then 80 00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:51.849 Jenny Duan: obviously for the game, just continuing, making progress on like",
    " the dialogue and opening scenes and things. So I also just wanted to a quick post check on your on the status of your Nc. Where application? I know it's still like, you know, it's due in November, so there's no rush. But like, do you have an update on that at all? 81 00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.370 huda: Yeah. So I finished the second essay, I think. 82 00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:04.179 huda: yeah, I like pieced together like, what we're like discussing last call. And then, like, I kind of 83 00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.250 huda: it's like within 2 50 words. But I don't know if it's like descriptive enough. 84 00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:14.209 huda: But yeah, I think I'm done with a second essay. 85 00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:23.560 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's something we can just put to like, really go over next week. But I think for. Now let's start with knee. 86 00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:32.619 Jenny Duan: Let's start with the SAT. Things. So when was the last time that you took an SAT, and had a tobacco. 87 00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:58.349 huda: I think the last time was actually nic last week. I was able to take one this week because of like like my sister was over and stuff. But like I think I want to take one like right after this call. I'm planning to take one like every day of the week. This week. So yeah, I got a 1480 on that one. But I think I could definitely improve like I think it was 88 00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.220 huda: 7 80 for the 89 00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:13.619 huda: reading and like writing. And then thanks. And then I think it was like I think it was like, just 700 for math. 90 00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:22.979 Jenny Duan: Okay? So I think right now, what we we should work on the most is the math. Do you have that copy of the test in front of you. Maybe we can go for the questions again. 91 00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.690 huda: Yeah, I think it's 92 00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.390 huda: is 93 00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.350 huda: with 94 00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:43.049 huda: ve",
    "rsion. This is the one that I printed it off so I'll just share my screen. I guess. 95 00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.750 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 96 00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.280 huda: Okay, 97 00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.619 huda: this one. I think I got. 98 00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.960 huda: So 99 00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.500 huda: I think I got this one wrong. 100 00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:49.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, can we start with the no calculator section, actually, and then go to the calculator section from there? Things? 102 00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.589 huda: Oh, wait. 103 00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.819 huda: Think it was 104 00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.549 huda: there was this one one of the ones that I got wrong. 105 00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:47.200 Jenny Duan: Okay, the graph for the function F has 2 X intercepts. So doing this type of question, are you able to find the X intercepts? First of all. 106 00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:52.219 huda: yeah, through the through factoring, I guess. 107 00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So what are the intercepts here? 108 00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.020 huda: wait. Oh, me 109 00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:07.289 huda: annotate. Yeah. You can feel free to annotate the screen. It'll be x plus 4 times x plus one. 110 00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.359 Jenny Duan: And if we turn this into coordinates, what are the intercepts? 111 00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.719 huda: Negative. 4 and negative one. 112 00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.210 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And what's the distance between those? 113 00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.099 huda: 3, 114 00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.329 Jenny Duan: right? 115 00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.329 Jenny Duan: So what confused you with this question? 116 00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:28.960 huda: I think like 117 00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.180 huda: I think 118 00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:45.329 huda: I probably read it wrong, cause I think I thought like it was one of those questions where I was asking. Like how many solutions there were. I ",
    "think that would have also been an easy fix, but I think it was like one of the last questions I came back to, because I skipped it. 119 00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.379 huda: And yeah, yeah, I guess when you skip a question, what goes through your head when you skip the question. 120 00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:57.250 huda: I kind of like see the ones which have like a lot of like calculating. 121 00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:05.780 huda: I think. But was this a lot of calculating. No, honestly, don't understand why I got this wrong. But 122 00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:35.460 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, yeah. I think our goal, like for the sat is like, you need to really minimize silly mistakes, because that really like impacts your work like it can be easy to be like, oh, you know, like, maybe make one or 2 mistakes. But then you realize, like on the sat, one or 2 mistakes is like 20 points or like 30 points, and that's pretty significant, especially when it comes to the math section, because you already have, like a really really strong meeting writing section. And that's honestly something that so many people are jealous of, because 123 00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:59.979 Jenny Duan: the reading regarding section is honestly the hardest to improve. But that's why it's important for us to get your math lockdown, especially because, since you're going to be applying for Cs, or like Cs adjacent majors, they really wanna see your like math math skill set there. Does that make sense. That's it to make sure that the math is top especially because you're gonna be applying for like Css, adjacent things. And they really care about that? 124 00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.340 Jenny Duan: So yeah, let's go to the next problem. 125 00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.000 huda: Okay? I think this one. 126 00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.450 Jenny Duan: Oh, it looks, it looks like a similar problem. Yeah. 127 00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.540 huda: so 128 00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.100 Jenny Duan: yeah. So you see, that would be ",
    "129 00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.570 huda: who? 130 00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.240 huda: times. 131 00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.089 huda: And then u squared minus t squared. 132 00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.360 huda: would I solve for U and T, first. 133 00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.900 Jenny Duan: yeah, so how can you factor this equation? 134 00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.979 huda: This one 135 00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:48.479 huda: wouldn't it be like U minus t, and then U squared minus TU, 136 00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.170 huda: minus t squared? 137 00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.909 Jenny Duan: Can you simplify this at all? 138 00:19:55.030 --> 00:20:00.050 huda: u plus TU, minus t. 139 00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.369 Jenny Duan: there you go. 140 00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.040 huda: Okay? 141 00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:10.079 huda: Oh, okay. So it will be 10. So it'll be 20. 142 00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:31.819 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, okay, here's something about the SAT. All the questions are easier than you think. They're not trying to test your ability to do complex math, because they know that you don't have a lot of time. They're trying to test your ability to reason through things. So whenever you see, like some a complicated expression like that. There's almost always a way to simplify that. 143 00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:43.639 Jenny Duan: So in this case, what they're testing is, I mean, obviously, you can solve for your U and T. And then you can like, do the actual computation. But that's like really computationally challenging. That takes a lot of time. So 144 00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:53.410 Jenny Duan: whenever you feel like you're doing too much work. You're probably doing too much work. So they really want you to find, like the simplest and easiest way to solve a problem cause like 145 00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:00.449 Jenny Duan: the test takers, the test graders. They don't want to spend a lot of time checking over your work, too, like that takes a lot of time. 146 00:21:00.490 --> 00:21",
    ":24.899 Jenny Duan: So they just wanna see like that, you're able to find the quickest way to do it. And in this case that would be to do what you just did so like simplify the expression, plug the values in and like they're giving you that information for a reason, right? They wouldn't give you, plus t equals 5 if they didn't want you to use u plus t somewhere in your answer. So that should give you a hint, like all the information they give you, it's there for a reason, and they want you to use it when you 147 00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.590 huda: solve the questions. 148 00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.820 huda: Okay? I mean. 149 00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.749 huda: I'm not sure cause 150 00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.310 huda: I think. 151 00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.310 huda: trying to see which ones I got wrong, cause these aren't like matching up with the ones that 152 00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:53.349 huda: I was having trouble. Maybe it's like a different test. Again. I remember that happened last time. Let me let me check the other ones. Let's see. 153 00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.520 Yeah. 154 00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:37.490 huda: okay, I think this is the one 155 00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:47.020 huda: I think it was this one. 156 00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.800 Jenny Duan: Okay. all this. Okay. so. 157 00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.410 okay, how can you? yeah. 158 00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:11.269 Jenny Duan: okay, approach. Let me know how you would approach this question. Can you walk me through like after seeing this question, what is your first instinct to solve it? 159 00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:19.150 huda: So maybe like so since y is equal to x squared, I do 2 x squared, plus 6 160 00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:25.629 huda: as equal to 2 x plus 6 and then what do you want to write that down? Yeah, perfect. 161 00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.090 Jenny Duan: Right? And then what's next? 162 00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.850 huda: And then you put it to the other side. 163 00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.960 Jen",
    "ny Duan: Yep. 164 00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.860 huda: think it was 0, right? Yeah. And then you do 165 00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.840 huda: 2 x, and then X, x minus one. 166 00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.880 Jenny Duan: Yeah, equal 0. 167 00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:01.330 Jenny Duan: It's also the same thing as maybe like. 168 00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.109 Jenny Duan: okay, 2 x times x minus one. 169 00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.829 Jenny Duan: So let's go ahead. 170 00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.300 Jenny Duan: Y, let's get the value of x 171 00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.279 huda: so X would equal to 0, or one 172 00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.430 Jenny Duan: right, and y is equal to what? 173 00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:24.690 huda: Oh, it will be either 0 or one. Okay. 174 00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:44.340 Jenny Duan: so how are you doing? So you basically just have the question there. So when you're originally solving it. What confused you about this question, or was there anything that confused you about it? Or was it just like seeing that system of equations and being like, Oh, my gosh! It's so messy. Yeah, that, too. And I just feel like I think this since I took this like 2 weeks ago. 175 00:24:44.340 --> 00:25:00.620 huda: I kinda didn't really like pay attention to like the math section before that. I was kind of like focusing more on the reading section. And I wasn't setting any like cause I read actually, yesterday I read, like the document that you sent, like all of it. 176 00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:16.800 huda: So like I was found. The section about the system of equations definitely simplified it for me. But I think, like the process that I did it in like was kind of different cause. I tried like subtracting or something, but I don't. That's not really the right way to do it. So 177 00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:24.989 Jenny Duan: I mean, after looking at. The explanation that we just worked through. What strategies from this are you going to apply to the next time you see a problem like this",
    " 178 00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:33.159 huda: I think like if I see, like like a variable, like getting assigned as one of them, I think substitution would be my first thought. 179 00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:41.930 huda: and then also, like like paying attention to to directions like how it says like access to be greater than 0 180 00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:48.979 huda: and then like, it's x and y? So what question? What answer did you put for this question? 181 00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.910 huda: I think I said, II guessed on this one, actually 3. 182 00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.340 Jenny Duan: Okay, got it. So 183 00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:02.320 Jenny Duan: yeah, let's just do the next. Oh, actually, another thing that you can do. 184 00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:10.180 Jenny Duan: If you have to guess is you can plug in back in. So, for example, if you did 3 well. 185 00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.289 Jenny Duan: if XY is 3, then x has to be like x or y has to be one and 186 00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.890 Jenny Duan: the other one has to be like 3. Right? One of them has to be one, the other one has to be 3. Right? 187 00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.129 huda: Does that make sense. Why, yeah. 188 00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:33.019 Jenny Duan: So if you plug that into, you can quickly see that like 3 is not one squared and one is not 3 squared. So that would just not work. 189 00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:41.730 Jenny Duan: So if you plug it back in like, the only answers that would work are one or 9 if you were to guess. 190 00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.739 Jenny Duan: Actually 9. 191 00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:56.229 Jenny Duan: Not want to work either, because. like, you could try 9 and one or 3 and 3, and like one, and is not 9 squared? 9 is not one squared like 3 is not 3 squared? So the only answer that works is one 192 00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:01.930 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? How you just like went process of elimination. Yeah. 193 00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.340 huda: that's another strategy you can us",
    "e if you ever get stuck. 194 00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:13.609 huda: So like, most of my incorrect ones are actually from like the calculator section. So let's maybe go there. Next. 195 00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.220 Jenny Duan: are there any more from a calculator or is the leverson calculator 196 00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.469 huda: the rest are all calculator 197 00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.210 huda: if 198 00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.260 well. 199 00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.330 great, wonderful on my. 200 00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.970 okay. 201 00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.740 huda: I think it was, no, I, 202 00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.130 Jenny Duan: yeah. 203 00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.870 huda: wait. 204 00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:02.040 huda: this one, yeah. 205 00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:20.829 Jenny Duan: Number 23. Yeah. Okay, the relationship between the monthly rental price are dollars, and the properties purchase price in thousands of dollars can be represented by a linear function, which is the following functions represent the relation. Okay, so let's look at the graph, right? So, okay. 206 00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:28.529 Jenny Duan: the the relationship between the rental price r and dollars in the properties. Purchase price. P, 207 00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.420 Jenny Duan: okay? 208 00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:41.519 Jenny Duan: So basically, what they're asking you to do is construct a system of equations based on the data that they give you. So how did you approach this question when you first looked at it. 209 00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.840 huda: So I think I did. 210 00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.990 huda: wait. This is 211 00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:58.360 huda: Okay. I think I did like 212 00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.180 huda: rental price to purchase price. 213 00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:12.300 huda: I don't wait. I think 214 00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.940 I did. I like divided them 215 00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:19.239 huda: like the purchase price by the monthly rental price. 216 00:29:20.",
    "300 --> 00:29:22.730 huda: I'm not. Why did you do the division? 217 00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.520 huda: I think to see, like like the 218 00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:33.900 huda: fraction of the price that, like the that, the rental prices compared to the purchase price. 219 00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:47.670 Jenny Duan: Okay, interesting. But remember, it's a linear function, right? So for I think that quite this type of question is actually pretty common. And I think the I'm just gonna walk the strategy to solving this. 220 00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.760 huda: Is that okay? 221 00:29:50.310 --> 00:30:08.639 Jenny Duan: So what they're trying to do is they're trying to have you construct a linear equation based on the data that they're given that they give you in the table. So if you just point, pick 2 arbitrary points like maybe choose to add addresses. Which ones do you want to choose clear water and go in view? 222 00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So now they want you to just construct a system of equations 223 00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.739 Jenny Duan: based on this. So if you have those 2 points like 224 00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.870 Jenny Duan: the monthly rental price in the property's purchase price is 225 00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:28.750 Jenny Duan: so the rental is going to be the the Y value and the properties. Purchase price is the X value. So 226 00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:38.809 Jenny Duan: if you take that like point 128,950 and 140,01040. Can you construct a linear equation based on that? 227 00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:46.739 huda: like, given that, they're x and y. 228 00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.330 Jenny Duan: yeah, like, for example, the 2 points are 229 00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.830 Jenny Duan: 1, 28, 0 0 0 230 00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.370 Jenny Duan: 9 15. 231 00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:04.839 Jenny Duan: And the second point is you chose was this 1 40, 0 0 0 232 00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.799 Jenny Duan: and 1040. Can you 233 00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:",
    "11.410 Jenny Duan: find the system of equations here? 234 00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:13.990 huda: Yeah. 235 00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.189 Jenny Duan: yeah. So why don't you do that? 236 00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.559 huda: You maybe. 237 00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:26.210 huda: would you be able to like? Plug them into one of the answers? 238 00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:33.459 Jenny Duan: Maybe. But in school have you learned how to create a system of equations with 2 points. If you haven't, that's okay. 239 00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:38.449 huda: I think we might have. But like a while ago. So I don't really remember. 240 00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:43.669 Jenny Duan: Okay, no problem. So do you know how to find the slope here? 241 00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.999 huda: Yeah, you do. 242 00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:57.670 huda: Would it be like 10040, I mean 140,000, minus 128,000, over 1,040, minus 9 50. 243 00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.100 Jenny Duan: It's the other way. So it's changing y over change in X. 244 00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.219 huda: Oh, yeah, okay? 245 00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.300 Jenny Duan: so you can use your calculator here, cause this is the calculator section. 246 00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.810 huda: There'll be 247 00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.550 huda: so like 248 00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.559 huda: one over 1, 20. 249 00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So. 250 00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:47.460 Jenny Duan: why don't you calculate that so? Is it 90 over one? 251 00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:49.980 Jenny Duan: Well, yeah. 252 00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.569 Jenny Duan: Can you repeat what you said for the values 253 00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.339 huda: for the coordinates, or the slope 254 00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.630 Jenny Duan: the slope. 255 00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.970 huda: one over 1, 20, 256 00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:12.229 Jenny Duan: one over one. Also remember, it's in thousands, so you can just do 1 40 minus 1 28 instead of 1, 40,000, minus 1 28,000. 257 00:33:1",
    "2.900 --> 00:33:16.969 huda: Okay, that should be like 90 over 12, I think. 258 00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:30.459 huda: yeah, 90 over 12. And if you do that division? What do you get? 259 00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.529 huda: you get 7.5. 260 00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.090 Jenny Duan: And what answer does that correspond to? 261 00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.679 huda: And deep? 262 00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:58.529 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's the correct answer. So I think the key strategy that we use right here is just figuring out how to go from the graph for the table to a system to an equation. And then the way that we did that was by finding the slope and then plugging that back in and just identifying the answer with the correct slope. 263 00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.690 huda: Does that make sense? Yeah. 264 00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:08.559 Jenny Duan: okay, amazing. So do you feel confident that you'd be able to do this type of question if presented to you in a different way. 265 00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:14.960 huda: I think maybe I might need like another practice one. something. So much of this, maybe. 266 00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.800 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 267 00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:24.230 Jenny Duan: There, there might not be any other practices in this test. But 268 00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:27.469 Jenny Duan: I can just give you another example. 269 00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.760 Jenny Duan: okay. 270 00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:35.179 Jenny Duan: let me just annotate the screen again. So 271 00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:39.219 Jenny Duan: okay, let me just make you a table with some values. 272 00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:58.410 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest thing is just finding this is like the system. Look like the equation that satisfies it. So if you have these points like 14, 5, 3, 8. Can you find the systems of equations here or the slope here? 273 00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.970 huda: I can't do the annotations. But yeah. 274 00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.510 Jenny Duan: oh, you can't see t",
    "he annotations 275 00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.960 huda: sure. okay, I can see them now 276 00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:22.570 huda: yeah, i'd be able to make one, so maybe 8 minus 5, which is 3 over. 277 00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.090 huda: 3, minus 14 278 00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.110 huda: and 279 00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:38.979 Jenny Duan: and what is that 8, minus 5, divided by 3, minus 14, negative, 3, over 11. 280 00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, amazing sounds perfect. 281 00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.930 Jenny Duan: so 282 00:35:45.380 --> 00:36:03.450 Jenny Duan: there you go with the slope. And I think that the biggest thing is then just fitting in the slope to the word problems. So do you feel confident with, like the wording of the problems? Or is that what you're confused by the most? What would you say, yeah, I think the wording is like the most confusing part cause 283 00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:16.290 huda: like II think it. Kinda I felt like it was asking me like what the price of the like. The purchase is in comparison to the the rental which is not really the case. 284 00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:44.929 Jenny Duan: right? So I think the thing that we need to notice is the question like which of the so the note that it can be represented by a linear function? I think that that's like the highlight. Because if you're doing a linear function, then you really don't need to be dividing like the X by the Y values, right? Because that would be like an inverse function. That wouldn't be a linear function. And so if you're looking for the relationship between the rental price and the properties. Purchase price then, and then asking for a linear function. Then I mean. 285 00:36:44.930 --> 00:37:02.410 Jenny Duan: when you see that keyword linear, I think, moving forward so like keyword, linear, just think, okay, linear. That means find slope like Sis, find the equation. So I think that with that framework in mind, like, if you see the keyword like linear function",
    ". Then you'll know how to then you'll know to 286 00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.649 Jenny Duan: do exactly that, to like find the slope and to 287 00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.430 Jenny Duan: make make the equation from that? Does that make sense? 288 00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.390 huda: Yeah. 289 00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.610 Jenny Duan: okay, amazing. 290 00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.079 Jenny Duan: Okay, what's the next question. 291 00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.580 huda: this one. 292 00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:52.639 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. A psychologist set up an experiment to say, the tendency of a person to select the first item in the in the experiment of probability, 300 people were presented with a set of 5 pictures arranged in a random order. Each person is asked to choose the most appealing picture. Now the first 150 participants, 36 chose, chose the first picture in the set among the ratings, 1, 50 participants. PP. People chose the first picture in the set of more than 20%. Okay. 293 00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:57.280 Jenny Duan: of the first. 294 00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.630 okay. 295 00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.989 of the remaining 5 and 150 participants. 296 00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.280 Jenny Duan: P people, if more than 20%. 297 00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:20.059 Jenny Duan: that if more than 20%. People chose the first pupil on this. Okay, so I think this is about just keeping track of all the information that's given to you. So 298 00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.109 Jenny Duan: we can start by doing a problem like this 299 00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.489 Jenny Duan: by sort of identifying all 300 00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.429 Jenny Duan: Gen. So in this experiment, we know that 301 00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:33.460 Jenny Duan: 300 people, to the total number of people is 300. Does that make sense? 302 00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.710 huda: Hmm. 303 00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.269 Jenny Duan: so that's the first piece of information that we're given. 304 00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:44.129 huda",
    ": Can you tell me what the second piece of information we're given is then we're given 305 00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:50.670 huda: of the first 1, 50 participants. So like half of the people. 306 00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.039 huda: From that 307 00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.910 huda: 36 people chose a picture. 308 00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:03.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, ex, exactly. So. Right now, we already know that like 36 people have chosen the picture right? 309 00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.179 Jenny Duan: Just first picture 310 00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.920 36 people chose. Picture one. 311 00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.839 Jenny Duan: My screen's freezing. 312 00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.180 Jenny Duan: 36 313 00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.580 Jenny Duan: chose picture one, okay. 314 00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:32.210 Jenny Duan: and then as the remaining 1, 50 participants. P people chose the first picture. 315 00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.510 Jenny Duan: So now we're looking for how many people 316 00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:42.080 Jenny Duan: chose the first picture. So if more than 20% of all participants chose the first picture. 317 00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.830 Jenny Duan: Okay, so you know. 318 00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:58.910 Jenny Duan: okay. So we know that more than 20%. Of people chose the first picture, and of the remaining P. People chose of the remaining. P people chose the first picture. 319 00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:03.889 Jenny Duan: so what is the total number of people who chose the first picture? 320 00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.949 huda: That would be like 20% of 300. So that would be 321 00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:19.370 Jenny Duan: not exactly right, because we know that more than 20%. But we don't know that 20% of people chose the first picture. Does that make sense? Oh, okay, so we know that 322 00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:26.129 of the remaining among the remaining 1 50 P people chose the first picture, and of the first 1, 50, 36, chose the 323 00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.010 Jenny Duan: firs",
    "t picture. So what's the total number of people who chose the first picture? 324 00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.350 huda: 36 plus P. 325 00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.810 Jenny Duan: Exactly perfect. 326 00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.970 Jenny Duan: So P. Plus 36 people, right? Chose the first picture right? 327 00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:48.079 Jenny Duan: And we know that more than 20%. Of all the people chose the first picture. Right? 328 00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.350 huda: so 329 00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.799 Jenny Duan: does this give you the correct answer, now. 330 00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.429 huda: okay, so it would be d 331 00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.229 Jenny Duan: amazing yeah. 332 00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.370 huda: does that make sense yeah for sure. 333 00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.150 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So what kind of confused you about this specific question? 334 00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:10.129 huda: I think, like kind of dealing with, like all these values like, it was kind of confusing, because 335 00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:29.609 huda: first, it's like half of the 300 are chosen and then 36 from that are chosen. And then I think I kinda got confused with like like the 20. I think I kinda disregarded this like more than part and then, like I guess 336 00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:36.240 huda: I thought it was equal to 2, 20%. And then I think I ended up choosing 337 00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:44.709 huda: this one. II didn't really make sense. So now that we talk through it. But yeah. 338 00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.719 Jenny Duan: awesome. So do you feel like, 339 00:41:48.870 --> 00:42:07.359 huda: the strategy that we use by identifying all the important information? Do you feel like that makes sense to you. I think I think I need to like start annotating like my math section. More cause. Usually I just like don't really annotate my math section that much and kinda like mainly do all my reading. But I think it's important for math as well. 340 00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.200 Je",
    "nny Duan: Cool. Yeah. Okay, can we look at the next question. 341 00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.370 huda: oh, yeah. I was. 342 00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:16.680 huda: wait. 343 00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.720 huda: Who was this one 344 00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.020 Jenny Duan: okay. 345 00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.949 surface area of a, cube is 6, times a over 4, where it is a positive constant. 346 00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:35.490 Jenny Duan: So what? Which gives the parameter of one face of the queue? Okay, so this is a easy question. Disguise as a hard question. So 347 00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:41.859 Jenny Duan: the wording of this makes it look super confusing. But can you tell me like, how do you find the surface area of a queue? 348 00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.529 huda: It's like 6 times like the 349 00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.609 huda: the area of one's like, square. 350 00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 351 00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:57.590 Jenny Duan: So 6 times like a squared right, if 80 is one of the sidelines, right. 352 00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:03.129 huda: well, we'll just call this like, be okay. Cause this is oh, my gosh, that's so messy 353 00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:09.859 Jenny Duan: 1, s, 6, b, squared, where b is like the side of the side of the queue. Right? 354 00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.910 Jenny Duan: So, okay. Oh, my gosh, sorry. 355 00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.340 Jenny Duan: There you go. So this is B right one side. 356 00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.310 huda: Yeah. Can you tell me what the perimeter of one face of the cube is 357 00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.199 huda: like in terms of height and length. 358 00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.050 huda: I mean heightened width 359 00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.100 in terms of being 360 00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:38.419 huda: one of the sides. 361 00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.730 Jenny Duan: you'll know. 362 00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.590 Jenny Duan: Rider of one face of the cube. 363 00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:43.480 Hello. 364 0",
    "0:43:44.090 --> 00:43:49.250 huda: let me. 365 00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.320 huda: I like. So, okay, so B, is, this is like 366 00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.260 huda: this 367 00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:56.870 huda: being amazing. 368 00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:10.849 Jenny Duan: One side, because, remember, 6 B squared is the area 6 B squared is the total surface area. But B is the side length right, because the surface area of one side is B squared. So B is the length of one of the sides. Okay. 369 00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.780 huda: so be a perimeter of the face. 370 00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:15.250 huda: it'll be 371 00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.219 huda: B times 4, yeah, so 4 b right, 372 00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.959 Jenny Duan: so so we know that if this is a surface area, then this is the perimeter right? 373 00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:36.049 Jenny Duan: okay, so then, if this is the side length, if a over 4 is our new b then what is 4 374 00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.720 Jenny Duan: times a over 4, 375 00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.920 huda: a. 376 00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.100 Jenny Duan: And that's the correct answer. 377 00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.320 huda: Oh, okay. 378 00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:46.949 does that make sense? 379 00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.980 huda: Oh, okay, I don't know. so 380 00:44:52.910 --> 00:45:01.069 huda: okay, so it's asking for the perimeter of one face of the queue. Okay, that makes like a lot more sense cause 381 00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:15.999 Jenny Duan: I think I was. I think I was solving, for, like the volume of the queue. I don't know what what's happening, but I think the key is just. I feel like all these questions. I think you totally understand how to do them. I think the confusion, maybe, is just like 382 00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.550 Jenny Duan: the 383 00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:34.539 huda: the process, like when you do them. I think you maybe you missed the what the questions actually asking you, or you tend to do rush. Do you feel like, yeah, I fe",
    "el like, definitely like the the math section like towards the end. So it's kinda like long. So like, I kinda rush through those. 384 00:45:35.260 --> 00:46:00.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think training like your ability to focus. And like, just, I know that the test is really long. But that's another thing. They're just training you like your ability to just sit down and like do it. And I think that's why, like doing the practice test as if they were a real exam is what's the most helpful? Because on a real exam like, you're ideally not rushing through the end of the exam. And I think on the practice exam, it's best to try to avoid doing that as well. 385 00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:05.779 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay, awesome. Can we go to the next question. 386 00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:12.680 huda: okay, okay. 387 00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.599 huda: I think it was this one 388 00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:25.050 Jenny Duan: very cool. And oh, we went. We went ahead like back to the beginning of the test. 389 00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.520 huda: Yeah, I just realized that like, I missed this one. 390 00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:29.740 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool 391 00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:35.509 Jenny Duan: the D pier. Plants increases its membership by a total of 10 businesses a year. 392 00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.900 Jenny Duan: There were B businesses in the beginning of the year. 393 00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.450 Jenny Duan: Okay? 394 00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:49.140 Jenny Duan: First of all, what type of equation are you expecting exponential or linear 395 00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:55.870 huda: a linear. 396 00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that means we can eliminate c and d right 397 00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.490 Jenny Duan: And what's the difference between option a and option, b. 398 00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:19.169 huda: I think B like subtracts with the amount of business that he had in the beginning. and then a adds its own. A, I think correct. 399 00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.65",
    "0 huda: Yeah, how much time does that take you like 30 s? 400 00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.320 Jenny Duan: What was confusing about this question? 401 00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:38.660 huda: I think I really assume that it was exponential, I think, never make an assumption. I have no idea. I don't know cause 402 00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:49.079 huda: I think I was like practicing like exponential questions before that. So I don't know. Okay, Gotcha, remember. Never make an assumption. 403 00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:55.460 Jenny Duan: Always use the information that the test gives you to solve it. Cool. What's the next one? 404 00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:00.059 huda: Let me go ahead over here. Think. 405 00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.879 huda: oh, yeah. Okay. 38. 406 00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:25.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. So if Miss Simon starts her drive at 6 30, she can drive about her average driving speed. Okay, one thing is, don't be intimidated. When a problem has a lot to words is, remember this, your reading section is really good. You know you have good reading comprehension, so there's no need to be worried. Some people they have bad reading 407 00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:47.350 Jenny Duan: friends. They need to be worried. But that's not the case for you. You don't need to be worried. Just approach the the question, even if it has a lot of words. So if Miss Simon starts to drive at 6 30 A. M. She can drive her average people with no traffic if she starts to drive at 7. Ok, the first thing I do when I look at this type of question is, I look at what the question is asking. So what is the actual thing that it's asking, based on the table. How many 408 00:48:47.380 --> 00:49:01.569 Jenny Duan: in more minutes does Miss Simon take to arrive at her work place if she starts her drive at 7, than if she starts her drive at 6 30. So what they're asking you to do is to calculate her drive at 7 and her drive at 6 30, and then look at the time difference it takes. 409 00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.320 Jen",
    "ny Duan: It's between those 2. 410 00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.589 huda: Does that make sense? Yeah. 411 00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:14.930 Jenny Duan: okay, so we can just start with calculating her time at 6 30. So she says, to drive at 6 30 with no traffic. How long does it take her to drive? 412 00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:23.509 huda: okay, so that would be 413 00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.879 huda: okay. So she's traveling point 6 miles at 414 00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.729 huda: 25 miles per hour. 415 00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.600 huda: so that we 416 00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.450 huda: 25 divided by point 6. 417 00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:43.950 huda: Oh, no, not I mean 418 00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.800 huda: point 6, divided by 25. 419 00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:55.670 Jenny Duan: okay, continue. 420 00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:57.300 huda: And then 421 00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.439 Jenny Duan: have you taken physics at the school by the way. 422 00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:02.830 huda: oh, yeah. 423 00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.970 Jenny Duan: yeah, awesome, continue. 424 00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:17.490 huda: yeah, so time is equal to distance over speed. Right? Yeah. loss per hour. And then so that was point 0 0 2 4. 425 00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:21.750 Jenny Duan: And then what you add what this? And then this right 426 00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.050 huda: sorry. Wait. 427 00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.360 huda: Yeah. And then you do 428 00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:29.269 huda: 50 429 00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:35.600 huda: and develop. and I mean, sorry. 430 00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:48.970 huda: And then you do 15.4 divided by 50, which is 431 00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.860 huda: 0 point 3 0 8. 432 00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.020 huda: And you add right to what you got before yeah. 433 00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:02.890 huda: oh, it was a previous value for that? 434 00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.620 huda: Oh, yeah, so 0 point 0 2 4 and 435 00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.040 huda: plus 436 00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:27.280 huda: 0",
    " point 3, 0 8 plus 437 00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:29.420 huda: and 438 00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.149 huda: 1.4 divided by 439 00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:41.230 huda: 3 5 is 0 point 0 4 which is 0 point 3 7 2, 440 00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.150 Jenny Duan: and could times that by 60 right to get minutes. 441 00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.950 huda: And then you get 22.3 2. 442 00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.430 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah. 443 00:51:52.450 --> 00:52:07.430 Jenny Duan: So, okay, now, all you need to do is all you need to do is calculate the travel time from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit, because, remember, you already have the 2 values from the freeway home to the freeway entrance and from the freeway exit to the workplace. 444 00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:16.579 Jenny Duan: So you know that the travel time from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit increases by 33. What does that mean for the number that you had calculated there. 445 00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:25.079 huda: oh, so that means like, we're going to have to multiply 1.3 3 446 00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:28.419 huda: times like the amount of minutes that it took. 447 00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:38.700 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for the middle value, only right? Because it's only the travel time from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit. Right? So if you multiply that by that, then what is the difference? 448 00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.680 huda: And 449 00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.849 huda: it will be 450 00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:15.460 huda: like in minutes it will be 6.0 9 8 4, 451 00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.360 Jenny Duan: yeah, 0 point 6 and 8, 4 min or hours 452 00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:23.040 huda: a minute. 453 00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:28.540 Jenny Duan: hmm! Let me do some calculation. 454 00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.730 Jenny Duan: 1 s. 455 00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:38.909 Jenny Duan: 15.4 250 times 60. That's no. And I and combined, I was like. 456 00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.110 huda: in total 457 00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:43.619 hu",
    "da: like all the other values as well. 458 00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, both. What we're trying to find is, see? 459 00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.079 Jenny Duan: Yeah, the difference between the time from the freeway exit to the freeway 460 00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:59.419 Jenny Duan: from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit. So read 15.4 4 15.4, divided by 50 U right 461 00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:06.659 Jenny Duan: times 1.3 right. and then time 16, and then minus whatever value you had before. 462 00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:10.330 huda: And 463 00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:40.110 Jenny Duan: so actually, there's what we're doing right now is kind of a longer way to do it. But there's actually like a much simpler and easier way. 464 00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:47.520 huda: Do you want me to just tell you what that is. Or would you like to finish doing it this way? First? I'd like a shorter way, if that's possible. 465 00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:56.119 Okay, so you know that the distance from the freeway home to the freeway entrance and the freeway exit to the work place. You know that that time doesn't change right? 466 00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:08.300 huda: Oh, yeah. So the only thing that changes is that the entrance to the freeway from the the travel time, from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit increases by 33%. Right? 467 00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:20.189 Jenny Duan: so all you need to do is calculate what that 33% of time is so all you to do is do Let me write on the screen 15.4 times 0 point 3 3 468 00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:23.960 Jenny Duan: right to find 33% of that 469 00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:26.549 Jenny Duan: divided by fiftieth right? 470 00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:30.710 Jenny Duan: And that whole thing times 16. That's the answer. 471 00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.760 huda: Oh, okay, that was quick. 472 00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:45.229 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense to you, though? Cause I the reason we went with the longer we first is cause. I wanted you to understa",
    "nd the concept before going to the shorter one. But does this concept make sense to you. Why, we can just do that. 473 00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:53.699 huda: So would it be like the same thing if we did 15.4, divided by 50 times 0 point 3 3. 474 00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.979 Jenny Duan: Yeah, same thing. Time 60. 475 00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.300 huda: Okay. okay, that makes sense. Then. 476 00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:05.229 Jenny Duan: okay, so now, I actually want you to explain this problem to me in your own words. 477 00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:12.529 huda: Okay? So so pretend, like, I don't know how to do this question. I'm seeing you on the sat. How would you explain this? 478 00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:17.880 huda: Okay? So we can see here that a. 479 00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:44.919 huda: We have to compare the 2 times of when, if she starts her drive at 6, 30, and at 7 am so at 6 30 she'll have like this normal time. With all these added but for 7 am. The amount of travel time from just this part is increased by thirty-second threer, I mean, not 30 s. 33% 480 00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:50.880 huda: and these 2 stay the same. 481 00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.280 huda: hmm, so 482 00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:57.419 huda: we wanna know how many minutes how many more minutes? 483 00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:02.120 huda: so to find this, we can do 15.4, divided by 484 00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:05.340 huda: 50 to find 485 00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.169 huda: And this is to find like 486 00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:15.120 huda: how many, I guess hours like what decimal hours? 487 00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:21.250 huda: you it takes to like drive that distance? which is. 488 00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:24.740 huda: which is 0 point 3 1 489 00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.339 huda: 0 point 3 1 and then 490 00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.939 huda: you wanna div. Then you wanna divide. 491 00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:39.049 huda: Oh, you know. Now you want to multiply that number 492 00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:43.539 huda: 0 point 3 one by",
    " 493 00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:56.800 huda: by 0 point 3 3, which is like the percentage that it increases. Like, I guess we're trying to find the 33% that it increases and then we're gonna multiply that 494 00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.500 huda: by 6 495 00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:06.809 huda: a 60 to find like the amount of minutes. And we get 6.1 3 8 0 0. 496 00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:12.089 Jenny Duan: And if we round to the nearest minute, which is 6 min 497 00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.250 Jenny Duan: perfect. 498 00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:28.499 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So the reason why I asked you to explain. That is because when you explain something out loud, it helps you like work through the gaps in your understanding, and then also helps you remember better. So, yeah, that makes sense. Does that make sense to you? Now? 499 00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.480 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. Was that the last question. 500 00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.979 huda: Let me just check and cool. 501 00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.470 huda: Okay, so this one 502 00:58:42.790 --> 00:59:12.129 huda: I like I got it correct. But like honestly, I'm not really sure how it's like, I, kinda wanna go like how to do this problem. Okay? Awesome. I'm technical at 6 pm. But I think we can just go over this really quickly. Then, if you have any additional questions after the sessions over, you can text me, and I can like annotate a drawing and send that to you. So my P is the center. What is the value of X, so we know that this is 20 degrees and 20 degrees and 503 00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.920 Jenny Duan: And 504 00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:31.810 Jenny Duan: what do we know about a quadrilateral? What is the number of angles in a quadrilateral? This is the approach that you need to take? So you know that, like, for example, a triangle 1 80 degrees quadrilateral, quadrilateral, 3 60 degrees. That's just something that you should just remember 505 00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:48.220 Jenny Duan: 360 degrees. Because if you think ab",
    "out it like a square, 4 90 degree angles does add up to 3 60 degree. So quadrilateral, 3 3, 60 degrees. Does that make sense. Another thing right now that we notice is, if we go through this circumference of the circle. 506 00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:52.609 Jenny Duan: this angle is going to be one half X, because these 507 00:59:53.330 --> 01:00:14.889 Jenny Duan: okay, this, this kind of unclear. But this is one half x, because you know that. These 2 angles are the same like the angles. B and C are both the same. So you know this is going to be one half of what's going through the radius, because whenever in a circle. You go through the circumference in the radius from the same points on the other side of the circle. It's gonna be just one half. 508 01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.600 and that's just like 509 01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.829 Jenny Duan: a geometrical fact that I guess you have to remember. Unfortunately. 510 01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.080 So if this is 20 and this is 20, and you know that 511 01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:33.919 Jenny Duan: this is going to be one half x, and this is going to be X, then we can say that 3, 60 minus 40 is going to be 320 degrees right? And then 300 512 01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:38.840 Jenny Duan: and 20 degrees is actually 513 01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.620 Jenny Duan: think this might be an easier way to 514 01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:52.079 Jenny Duan: okay. So you know, 320 degrees is the rest of the shape. Right? And 515 01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.600 Jenny Duan: let's see. So 516 01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:01.909 Jenny Duan: okay, what you need to do is now we know that 2 x 517 01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:07.230 Jenny Duan: plus 3, 16. Sorry 518 01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.880 Jenny Duan: x plus. 519 01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.820 Jenny Duan: Let me just text, write this on text 520 01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:20.880 Jenny Duan: x plus 3, 60 minus 2 x is equal to 3, 20. Does this make sense, or is this confusing? 521 01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:34.940 Jenny Duan",
    ": Because you know that this is like one half x. So this is x as 2 X, and you know that you know the entirety of this angle is 3, 68 degrees. So the angle p is gonna be 3, 60 minus 2 x is equal to 3, 20. 522 01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:43.289 Jenny Duan: So then we can stay like X, negative x plus 3, 60 is equal to 3, 20, right 523 01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.560 huda: so negative X is equal to negative 40. So X is equal to 4 degrees. Does that make sense? 524 01:01:50.140 --> 01:02:07.269 Ivy Mentors: Okay, cool. So I'm sorry if that was his feed run. If you have any other questions about that, just text me and I'll send you an explanation. But I do have to hop off now, because I have another thing going on. Thanks a lot I appreciate. I mean, we can quickly connect on the you know. Chat but I truly appreciate being the extra time. Thanks so much. 525 01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.889 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, no problem. And good luck with your sat. 526 01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:36.789 Jenny Duan: And remember to read each question carefully, because, as you were going through all the questions. What we realized, remember is, you're able to get all the questions within like 30 s. Like most of the questions we talked about, you know how to do. It wasn't like you didn't know how to do them right. So the key is, take your time. Work slowly. Be mindful of the clock and read every question, identify all the important information, and then just solve it with no rushing. 527 01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:58.300 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest issue is you to rush. But I think if you slow down and just take your time and identify all the key information and what the question is asking, you should be able to do good, too. Yeah, I think one more point would be good before the exam, just to get that model boost, and you know, final kind of preparation, but I truly appreciate. I mean you can. You can hop on to the other thing connect."
