It was so fun. And like, just alright, I guess I'm still trying to register that like, probably close, actually like acknowledged me so it's so cool. 7 00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.500 Jenny Duan: Wow! Yeah, awesome. Did you get to meet a lot of other girls like? Do you keep in contact with them at all? 8 00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.349 huda: Yeah, we shared our socials in the slack. And so we just kinda like followed each other. But yeah. 9 00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:09.999 Jenny Duan: Super cool. I think one of the best parts about code of the clock to see is definitely like the alumni community, and being able to know that, you know. Now, if you have like a passion for Cs, or you wanna work in a project, or you you just wanna like talk to someone about coding like there's lots of other people who, you know, share the same share, the same things as you. So super good. 10 00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.600 huda: Yeah. 11 00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.699 Jenny Duan: yay, and did you? You ended up building the skin. Care one right. 12 00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.380 huda: Yeah. 13 00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:21.692 Jenny Duan: That's super awesome. Have you? 14 00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.160 Jenny Duan: Have you done anything with AI before with working in Comml, or anything like that? 15 00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.549 huda: I think this is actually like my first time ever working with like AI, actually. So that was really cool. 16 00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's it's another thing that's cool about Komla is for the other camps. They use Google teachable machine. Have you played with that before? 17 00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.850 huda: No. 18 00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.540 Jenny Duan: Maybe it's something that you can even incorporate into like empowering AI sessions. Let me just show you 19 00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.579 Jenny Duan: what it is. 20 00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.750 Jenny Duan: 1 s 21 00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.983 Jenny Duan: but teachable machine is basically this, like Google AI model that you can use and it's another image classifier. So 22 00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:13.419 Jenny Duan: I just sent you a link in the chat. But like, if you press new project, you can make image audio or post project, so it will like, it's basically like Coml, where it categorizes things based on a set of training data. 23 00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.150 Jenny Duan: But 24 00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.734 Jenny Duan: it, it would be cool to maybe incorporate with empowering AI or something like that, too. 25 00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:24.310 Jenny Duan: But Coml is actually an apple proprietary thing that hasn't been released yet, so. 26 00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.560 huda: Whoa! 27 00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.574 Jenny Duan: Largely pretty much only used in 28 00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.599 Jenny Duan: yeah. Only used in covid classy. So Covell is pretty cool. 29 00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:46.990 huda: Cool. Yeah, I think I think some of the people that attended were the ones who made it. Cause. I remember some guy was like coming around and asking us like how our experience with Coml was. So it's pretty cool. 30 00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And it was cool to connect with a lot of apple people. Wasn't it like. 31 00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.340 huda: Yeah. 32 00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.040 Jenny Duan: From all different places. Yeah. 33 00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.020 huda: The panel is really nice, cause like 34 00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.620 huda: their like journey was so inspiring, and I was like 35 00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.770 huda: definitely want to be with them. One day. 36 00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.235 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for sure. 37 00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:27.700 Jenny Duan: And then I wanted to kind of do a recap of everything that you're working on. Just so we I know we've been focused on a lot of applications recently, but I kind of wanna do like as spend some time talking about just how your general progress is going and everything. So maybe we can start with like full flipped. Are you still actively pursuing that? And how's that going for you? 38 00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.176 huda: Yeah, so 39 00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:48.102 huda: so actually, this guy, I think he's like a college student or he has, like a nonprofit for like marketing, and he wanted to set up like a 30 min call talking about folklift and like it's mission everything and he just wanted to see like 40 00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:59.180 huda: like, it's just like he's not trying to sell anything he just wants to know, like more about the initiative. So I I that's gonna be like tomorrow at 8? Pm, I think, yeah. 41 00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.090 Jenny Duan: Oh, cool 42 00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.990 Jenny Duan: And 43 00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.410 Jenny Duan: beyond that 44 00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.500 Jenny Duan: How's 45 00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.060 Jenny Duan: how's like the submissions going like? Are people submitting to your journal? How is that going. 46 00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:24.244 huda: Yeah. So oh, yeah, I forgot to mention someone from like my personal Instagram. For like from my school, wrote a poem about like Gaza. So I I'm gonna publish that 47 00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.759 huda: I'm just working on like the code for that and then 48 00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:32.230 huda: and then also someone applied. 49 00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:47.249 huda: I guess, like, you know how I have like the application. For, like the cultural ambassador thing. So there was like someone who applied from there. And then I'm gonna and I emailed them. But like, I just emailed them today. So yeah, we'll see like 50 00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.500 huda: when they send their first work. But yeah. 51 00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think one thing that would be really cool is if you submitted to a 52 00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:09.940 Jenny Duan: like a human rights essay competition. So let me send up a minute to try to find one for you right now. But I feel like, since you are leading this initiative. Booklist, and you're like other people are submitting works it 53 00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.004 Jenny Duan: to me. It makes sense that you submit something, for, like a similar rating competition, 54 00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.290 Jenny Duan: so 55 00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.810 Jenny Duan: give me a second 56 00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.680 Jenny Duan: to do some research. 57 00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.210 huda: Oh, also in English. So my teacher! She's having us write. 58 00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.834 Jenny Duan: There's this, there's one 59 00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:42.620 huda: Oh, sorry. Yeah. My teachers having us write like 5 common app essays. So we're gonna have to already start like brainstorming on that. But yeah, it's kinda scary. 60 00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.039 Jenny Duan: Well, like like 5 drafts of a com, like different essays for the common app. 61 00:05:50.040 --> 00:06:04.699 huda: Yeah, it's I'm I wanna like, make them really good. Cause like, if it's really good. And I feel like she'll kind of see my potential and maybe write like a re letter of recommendation for me. So I'm trying to like, write really good essays. Yeah. 62 00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.080 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 63 00:06:06.003 --> 00:06:09.630 Jenny Duan: Why are you writing 5 different coming up essays. 64 00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:12.889 huda: I have no idea. And then we like 65 00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:29.439 huda: we have to pick 5 out of the 7. And then actually, one of the prompts is just like put an Essie that you've written for something else before. And so I just use, like one of the ones that I use for the summer applications, and I think I might like reuse some that we wrote together. But yeah. 66 00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like 5 is a lot, especially since, like, you know, you're not 67 00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.119 Jenny Duan: quite. No, you don't. You don't need 5. But. 68 00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.770 huda: Yeah. 69 00:06:38.087 --> 00:06:50.472 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so okay, I found that competition that I want want you to enter. And I'll make a note of this later. But this is due. I think it's just an essay contest, but it's due. 70 00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.361 Jenny Duan: it's due on April first. But if you win this, you get a 71 00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:07.759 Jenny Duan: You can do semester. S. You get an all expenses paid. Educational voyage. Come over to see a semester. SC. Not really sure what that means. But 72 00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.300 Jenny Duan: I think this is like good for you to for you to enter. 73 00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:17.450 Jenny Duan: Let me look at the current and past winning essays. 74 00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.930 Jenny Duan: I think this is gonna be pretty competitive, because it's. 75 00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.669 Jenny Duan: you know not. 76 00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.239 Jenny Duan: There's only one winner. There's not like, you know, multiple winners. But I think like 77 00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.540 Jenny Duan: doing something like this would be really impressive. This is a a previous winner 78 00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.189 Jenny Duan: can look at this right now. 79 00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.549 Jenny Duan: But I think this is like you just focus on the foreign services 80 00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.830 Jenny Duan: work in something. 81 00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.460 Jenny Duan: This is the hundredth years. 82 00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.870 Jenny Duan: It's about foreign American foreign services. 83 00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.440 Jenny Duan: So like us, involvement abroad, I believe. 84 00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.010 Jenny Duan: The pro. 85 00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.660 huda: So like. 86 00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.519 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! 87 00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.930 huda: Oh, sorry. So do you think it like could write something 88 00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.060 huda: about Gaza? Or do you think that would be like kind of controversial. 89 00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.719 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna look at the prompt. It's okay. 90 00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.469 Jenny Duan: What do you believe? 91 00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:18.210 Jenny Duan: Okay, what do you believe is the biggest challenge the foreign service will face. And how do you think American diplomats can mitigate it? 92 00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:22.320 Jenny Duan: So maybe we can think about like, you know. What do you think is the biggest challenge. 93 00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.170 huda: I sorry you're kind of cutting out, but I think the biggest challenge. 94 00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.350 Jenny Duan: Necessarily like the Us. Embassy, and, like all the people you know from the Us. Working in other countries. 95 00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.066 huda: Sorry. I think it it just like cut out. But 96 00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.370 Jenny Duan: But go ahead. 97 00:08:36.610 --> 00:09:00.230 huda: Yeah. So I think the biggest problem is probably like trying to balance like cause. There's one side that that's really pushing for aid. And there's another which is like like the both sides of the argument because of American people, are basically split right now. Between foreign policy with Israel and Gaza and I think maybe like 98 00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:03.663 huda: a solution to that. Maybe like 99 00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.300 huda: offering some sort of like 100 00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.130 huda: like peace like I don't explain like ceasefire, but like 101 00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.730 huda: also condemning like 102 00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.678 huda: things that other people 103 00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.469 huda: condemn. You know. 104 00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.080 Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah. 105 00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.890 huda: Balance in Tucson. 106 00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.983 Jenny Duan: That's good. 107 00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.650 Jenny Duan: yeah, for sure. 108 00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.019 Jenny Duan: I think that that was a really good essay topic. And again, this is 109 00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.259 Jenny Duan: the type of thing where I think, like 110 00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.570 Jenny Duan: you just submit, and then, you see it. It's very low probability of like 111 00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.849 Jenny Duan: winning the award cause. It's only one person, but, like, I think 112 00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.430 Jenny Duan: now, we can start just applying to more and more writing awards, like hopefully, one of them will pay off. 113 00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, on. 114 00:09:51.720 --> 00:10:00.050 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So that's due on April first, let me see if I can find anything else off the top of my head. 115 00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.490 Jenny Duan: Ellen. 116 00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.200 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 117 00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.714 Jenny Duan: Oh. 118 00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.550 Jenny Duan: okay. 119 00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.480 Jenny Duan: I think 120 00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.598 Jenny Duan: I think this is like the most immediate one that hasn't. That doesn't have a 121 00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.020 Jenny Duan: past deadline already. 122 00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.180 Jenny Duan: So 123 00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.180 Jenny Duan: this is good. 124 00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:31.240 Jenny Duan: Oh, also, like Columbia, the Columbia undergraduate Law Review 125 00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.819 Jenny Duan: has an 126 00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.149 Jenny Duan: in essay contests. But I don't think they're open right now. 127 00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:50.680 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I feel like this is a good one to start with, it's due April first. So I would say, for this one. Reading the past essay, it kind of looks like it's like you can do. You have Gpt. 4. By the way. 128 00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.500 huda: Yeah. 129 00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.980 Jenny Duan: Okay 130 00:10:54.544 --> 00:10:56.429 Jenny Duan: a lot of this essay looks. 131 00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:05.579 Jenny Duan: in my opinion, Gpt, formable, because, like the writing style is very formal. So I would say like, don't spend too too much time on it. Just like. 132 00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.631 Jenny Duan: do your research use Tatt and like, submit it. 133 00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:18.430 huda: Yeah, my history teacher about it, because, like she has a, she's really opinionated about like foreign policy and stuff. 134 00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.259 Jenny Duan: Okay. I'm at. 135 00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.420 huda: Oh, sorry! It keeps like cutting out. 136 00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:32.050 Jenny Duan: But the next thing that I wanted to talk about is empowering AI. And then I just wanted to see how that 137 00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.611 Jenny Duan: oh, I think it's my wi-fi here, let me just 138 00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:38.000 Jenny Duan: it's okay. 139 00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.829 Jenny Duan: It's a fun. 140 00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.769 Jenny Duan: and if I go to this part it'll be better let me know if it keeps cutting out after this. Okay. 141 00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.380 huda: Yeah. 142 00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:53.380 Jenny Duan: Okay? So the other thing is wanted to check in on empowering AI, and how that's going? Do you have any updates on that front? 143 00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:10.567 huda: Yeah, this weekend we're gonna be having our last session. Last time I thought like my vice President, would kind of like facilitate that. But she never sent out the email or anything. So I guess we're doing like our last one this week. And then, 144 00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:26.749 huda: yeah, I'm gonna like, make this slide show probably like tonight. And and then I was thinking, like, we're gonna start like making certificates and everything for everyone that participated and kind of sending them out virtually 145 00:12:27.474 --> 00:12:29.530 huda: and yeah, I think 146 00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:46.280 huda: I think for future plans. So now I can. I'm gonna start getting like in touch with the keynote speaker that we we're talking with before and then we're gonna make slides for her, and set an actual date for the the event. 147 00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.970 huda: and I think 148 00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:58.159 huda: so. You did. Like give teachable machine for Google. I think it's like a really good tool. So maybe we can just have like a one day like 149 00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:18.040 huda: quick session, with a bunch of kids. And we can just do like teaching about that. But that probably might take some time to get people interested. But yeah, also, since I'm in contact with the school Newsletter. Now I can try asking them to post that there as well. So yeah. 150 00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.380 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds good. I 151 00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:30.190 Jenny Duan: I how do you feel about your your vice President? Not really doing that? That much for empowering AI. Is this a one off issue, or is this a recurring issue. 152 00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:59.873 huda: This is a pretty recurring issue, and like so I think so. I did kind of demote her to publicity director. But then there was like the first first week she kind of got like us a lot of people which kind of just showed up for the first session. But then but yeah, and then I kind of felt bad. And she was looking at the website. She saw that it was like publicity director and not vice president. And she showed it to her parents, and they got really mad. But yeah, and 153 00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:12.810 huda: but like, yeah, I feel like she just. I also told her to like, be in charge of the social media and kind of make lots of content for it. And she agreed, but she didn't do anything. So yeah. 154 00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:19.071 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Well, I feel like she shouldn't be upset if her work doesn't translate into the 155 00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.239 Jenny Duan: that shouldn't be something she should view through but I mean, are you looking for another vice President? Or how's that working. 156 00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:41.780 huda: If I if I replace, I don't think that'll go down well, but if I but like if I do find one, I mean. 157 00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:55.779 huda: the thing is like, the problem is, we're even like looking for, like more people to join our team. And we still couldn't find anyone so like finding another person might be difficult. Especially since it's like kind of limited. So we're only doing, girls. 158 00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.930 huda: As the officers are like board members. So 159 00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.249 huda: I'll I'll try to like, look out for like anyone who might be interested. But yeah. 160 00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.714 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I think the other thing you can do is 161 00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:19.539 Jenny Duan: reach out to the code with Clausy network. Once that like discord and circle, I believe, is the other platform. Once that's set up, I would say, try to 162 00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.689 Jenny Duan: get involved with that platform. 163 00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:23.060 huda: Yeah. 164 00:15:24.747 --> 00:15:30.770 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Now, the next thing that I won't talk about is film club, and just how that's going. 165 00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:45.044 huda: Yeah, so I talked with I talked with. So he's a secretary so like, oh, so we talked, and him and me are kind of like again doing like most of the work for the club. So then we decided, we're gonna 166 00:15:45.350 --> 00:16:02.848 huda: see, like the people that have been like contributing to the club as members. And we we're gonna place them as officers, currently, because, the other people have also just like said, Oh, I I'm fine. I don't really need the officer role anymore. So we're kind of, we're just like replacing them. And then 167 00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:12.739 huda: so we did have sent out our trailers before, but now we're actually on the editing process for the film and then we had like a club president's meeting like 168 00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:35.979 huda: yesterday and so then I had to share about like what we did, and recognition and everything. So I think club recognition is getting pretty well is going pretty well. But then also for promotion on our short film, we're gonna be attending like we have this thing called Culture Night, where all the clubs have to participate. And we're gonna be playing our 169 00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:46.099 huda: short film and like, kind of having some fun activities around that. And also just like kind of filming videos for promotion on our short film. 170 00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.406 Jenny Duan: Super cool. 171 00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:54.190 Jenny Duan: and then after that, after film club, I'm wondering like 172 00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:02.880 Jenny Duan: with film. You're are you still going to be President next year. Is there another election for that? Okay, cool. There's no like election process. 173 00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:16.590 huda: Yeah, it's usually like cause. Usually the President is like in charge of, like, you know, getting the documents and like enrolling your club again. So then that kind of stays the same. But then the rest of the officers kind of change. But 174 00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:17.390 huda: yeah. 175 00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.569 Jenny Duan: So are you. 176 00:17:21.765 --> 00:17:23.440 huda: Sorry you're cutting out again. 177 00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.649 Jenny Duan: Are you paying new officers? And how's that going, or how will that be going. 178 00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.193 huda: Oh, yeah. So for now, 179 00:17:34.670 --> 00:18:02.281 huda: so right now we're usually the elections take place in like the beginning of the year. So like right now. We just have like these new officers or sophomores. Cause they've been like participating a lot the past 2 years. They've been like acting in the short films they've been actively editing. So I offered them those positions of like the officers which aren't really active in our club. So yeah, 180 00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:18.249 huda: yeah. And then next year, we hope to like, have another election. We usually do applications. So then, like the officers like the President, the Vice President, get to decide. Cause. That's what we did this year. And last year. So yeah. 181 00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:27.174 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. And then another question is, have you been able to talk to your vice principal? And how's that like relationship going. 182 00:18:28.414 --> 00:18:36.335 huda: Yeah. So I like, I like, said Hi to her here and there. But I'm I'm still working on getting like a meeting with her 183 00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:46.810 huda: cause. She's kind of busy during the time that like, we have like break. So it's like success sessions. You're basically like flexes. So like. 184 00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.509 huda: yeah, she's kind of busy during that time, but I've been like trying to set up a meeting with her. Still. 185 00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.809 Jenny Duan: Okay, cause we wanna get that nomination for the Reagan leadership prize. 186 00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.860 Jenny Duan: So I think it's important that she does that. 187 00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.849 huda: Do you think? If I like? If I kind of 188 00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.900 huda: talk a bit more to my counselor? Do you think that would be like a valid kind of like source. Maybe. 189 00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:20.679 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think all she needs to do. I looked at the right. I looked at it. You only need to write like a short paragraph, and as long as she nominates you, you get the award basically so like it should not be to like 190 00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.144 Jenny Duan: it should not be too much effort on her end. I think. 191 00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:31.969 Jenny Duan: it's due on April fifth. That's why I'm reminding you, because it is like, you know, semi semi soon. So. 192 00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:44.629 huda: Actually, I think my counselor might be really busy cause the counselors are like starting to talk about college and everything. So she might get a bit annoyed. So I'm I'm gonna try a bit more with the vice principal. Maybe. 193 00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.510 Jenny Duan: Okay, but it's April fifth. Just remember this. It can be your principal. It can be, maybe, if your principals willing to help you. That could also be a good thing. 194 00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.429 Jenny Duan: but it can be a principal vice principal, just a school administrator or counselor like 195 00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.840 Jenny Duan: that. All works. 196 00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.135 huda: Okay. Sounds good. 197 00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.814 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and then the other thing is 198 00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:06.840 Jenny Duan: toe. 199 00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:14.049 Jenny Duan: Let me see what else? Oh, yeah, the game. How is that going? And like more so on, like the publicity side. How's that going. 200 00:20:15.332 --> 00:20:30.510 huda: I guess I haven't done much publicity for the game so far. But in April, we're supposed to be filming. The second, podcast which? I'm actually me speaking on. And so so I don't know if I told you this, but like a few. 201 00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.802 huda: maybe like a month ago. Actually 202 00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:52.300 huda: the guy like we have like a call and he told me, like what type of questions he'll be asking. He's talked a lot about AI. So I think a lot of the questions for me like, Do you think AI is? Gonna take over jobs and stuff like that which I I don't really know, like how that relates to my game. But yeah. 203 00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.790 Jenny Duan: Hmm, okay. 204 00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.589 Jenny Duan: are there any other opportunities that you could take to publicize your game? Do you think. 205 00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:13.130 huda: So I so I did try reaching out to like a few like South Asian journals. Because, like my characters, are South Asian and like. 206 00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.650 Jenny Duan: Could. 207 00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:29.640 huda: So there's like a lot of articles which are like, Oh, here, like representation games. They're kind of not reaching out back so maybe I can try like mass sending, like many, many journals. And then also 208 00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.239 huda: maybe like more podcasts, like, maybe 209 00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.345 huda: yeah, 210 00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.149 huda: all I can think of right now. 211 00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:50.940 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good to me. I'm wondering, how have you started working on like the toolkit and how that's working 212 00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.340 Jenny Duan: like the elementary school, or like the school toolkit. 213 00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:54.930 huda: Oh! 214 00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:55.909 Jenny Duan: With the game. 215 00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:04.720 huda: Yeah, I I didn't really start on that. But I think I I can work on it. This week. Yeah. 216 00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:18.050 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good. Because I think if we can get that mass sent out, that would be really impactful or impressive for you. So I feel like that. That's like something we can click on. Let me make a note to do that. 217 00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:27.302 huda: Oh, yeah, are there any like essays and applications I should be working on right now? 218 00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.490 huda: currently. 219 00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.294 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's where we we're gonna get to next. I think right now. 220 00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:39.579 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest you've already submitted many, many, many things, but I think the make noise today would be 221 00:22:40.164 --> 00:22:42.420 Jenny Duan: oh! The application passed. 222 00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.529 huda: So I was a minute. 223 00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.230 Jenny Duan: And I think. 224 00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:58.770 Jenny Duan: oh, perfect. Okay, cool. Thanks. So much for submitting that. I think the next thing is this essay contest. So maybe we can brainstorm and create an outline for that essay contest next. But we've been applying for so many things I'm wondering like. Besides, Notre Dame, have you heard back from anything else yet. 225 00:22:59.634 --> 00:23:01.819 huda: I haven't heard back from any 226 00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.659 huda: other programs. So. 227 00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.048 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. No worries. I'm sure that I'll take up some more time. But 228 00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.019 Jenny Duan: I'd also like to spend some time thinking about your summer, and like most of these programs that 229 00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.200 Jenny Duan: oh, can you hear me. 230 00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.830 huda: Oh, yeah, I get it. 231 00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.599 Jenny Duan: Okay, did I cut out, or can you hear me? 232 00:23:28.128 --> 00:23:28.962 huda: You could have. 233 00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:51.838 Jenny Duan: Okay, sorry about that. Most of the programs that we applied for are not like the whole summer. So I also wanna spend some time thinking about your summer and like how you spend, how we plan to spend like the rest of your summer beyond. These specific programs cause I do feel like, you know. Obviously, there's there's time for you to pursue other things, and to, you know, try new things, too. 234 00:23:53.110 --> 00:24:02.019 Jenny Duan: so what right now do you have any idea of like what you would want to spend the summer doing beyond, like the different summer programs that you've applied for. 235 00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:17.939 huda: I think definitely like for empowering AI, I think definitely doing a lot more projects and competitions. I think I was thinking of doing like a mini like hackathon type thing. So it's I. I kinda got inspiration from coderation, but we'd have like 236 00:24:18.677 --> 00:24:21.602 huda: like one tool like we had 237 00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.654 huda: that on the was the applicant. 238 00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.970 Jenny Duan: Teachable machine. 239 00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:38.470 huda: Yeah, like, like, yeah, for example, that and then everyone has to make their own project. And then we kind of judge which one has like the best pitch and everything. So I think that that'll be really 240 00:24:38.722 --> 00:24:48.410 huda: good. And then we could. And then I was thinking, maybe we could have like different age groups, so they could be like one for high schoolers, and then one for middle schoolers and one for younger. But yeah. 241 00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.280 huda: and then 242 00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:52.299 Jenny Duan: Really good, and then 243 00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.370 Jenny Duan: go ahead. 244 00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:11.174 huda: Yeah, I was trying to think, maybe, like, also, like growing my impact for folklift. Oh, yeah. So the San Francis actually got back to me. And they asked for the email just to like forward their communications. But I haven't heard anything back, so I might kind of like follow up again. 245 00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.866 huda: but yeah, 246 00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:20.629 huda: so like, kind of growing more impact with folklife. Maybe writing a lot more articles and getting people I know, to write articles so. 247 00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:42.580 Jenny Duan: That seems really good. I think the other thing is, it would be cool to do something related to game development, because it seems like there's not like a really good resource for like youth, or especially like young girls interested in game development to pursue that. So maybe, like as part of a partner, AI or something beyond that. You could do like some type of game development program. 248 00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:49.640 Jenny Duan: We're like creating something like an educational resource or educational opportunity to get people inspired in game development. 249 00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:58.024 huda: Yeah. Oh, also on a question. So, oh, yeah, today was my sat so I think. 250 00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.590 Jenny Duan: You took the full sat today. 251 00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.323 huda: Yeah, yeah. 252 00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.079 Jenny Duan: Oh, my! Gosh! How'd it go? 253 00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:28.857 huda: Okay. So I think I did like, I'm pretty confident on my reading. I feel like there weren't any like question. So I know, definitely got harder, because there's like some vocabulary that I didn't know. But I think I wasn't able to make really great choices. And I think reading went really well, and I was expecting a pretty high score. But for math, I think there's like 3 questions that I didn't know how to do for one of them like I like literally physically measured. 254 00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:53.649 huda: one of them so like it was kind of an educated guess. But I I'm not sure how math is gonna go. But so so reading, I I have like really high hopes for reading but yeah. And then I was thinking about like if I get a high score for reading since I already got a 780 in math. What like? And I supersed what are like the drawbacks of supersoring your sat like if there are any. 255 00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:24.180 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think it's just like they can see all your past tests. So they see you like, give me a list of tests regardless. So I think I think it's better obviously to not super score. So hopefully, you did well, on this exam. And don't worry about it being hard, because since you're so well prepared, like, if it's hard for you, it's like, gonna Be hard for other people in the curve for compensate. So I would say, don't maybe don't worry about that as much, but I would say like it's better to not superscript. But if you feel confident on your reading, and obviously you did good on math last time. It should be fine. 256 00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.249 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 257 00:27:27.255 --> 00:27:28.080 huda: Yeah. 258 00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.540 Jenny Duan: Wow! I can't believe it was today on a Wednesday. Was it at school, or was it at. 259 00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.880 huda: Yeah, I was at school. 260 00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.420 Jenny Duan: Did a lot of other people do it? 261 00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.030 huda: Yeah, there's like, I think a hundred 20 people taking it in our test center. 262 00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.190 Jenny Duan: Oh, wow! Yeah. How did do you know how other people felt about it at all? 263 00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.972 huda: A lot of people felt like the reading was really bad. 264 00:27:50.540 --> 00:28:07.409 huda: then, I think math like module 2. Everyone was like, oh, this did not go well and cause there's like a question where, like, you're given 2 points on a circle, and then you're supposed to find, like the tangent of the degree. And it's like, really confusing. But yeah. 265 00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.084 Jenny Duan: Hmm, oh, wow! 266 00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:17.779 Jenny Duan: okay. Well, I think if you I mean, if you feel confident in reading and like no one else does, that's like a really good sign. First of all. 267 00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:23.310 Jenny Duan: and how does it? How did you feel about this one compared to your last, your like previous exam? 268 00:28:24.588 --> 00:28:27.969 huda: I think definitely like or like the one on paper. 269 00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.259 Jenny Duan: Yeah. The one on paper. 270 00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:41.159 huda: I think this new format of like reading is. I don't know if it's because I've been like practicing a lot with Steven and everything. But like the questions are a lot more like. 271 00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:59.430 huda: like, I feel like, you can understand that this is this type of question. And like you can like attack it a certain way. Cause, for example, there's like one where it gives you like a bunch of data. And then you're supposed to like make a sentence which combines all that, and it's like really easy to do so like 272 00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:20.720 huda: I just feel like a reading like the shorter passages are also nicer for me, cause I'm able to like pay attention the entire time. But like math, I just and also like another part about the reading is, it's kinda hard to annotate cause you have to like highlight, and then I click a button. So it's like a bit difficult. But like other than that. Reading's fine. But math 273 00:29:21.002 --> 00:29:21.929 huda: I just feel like. 274 00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.599 huda: Like having it on a screen is just kind of like 275 00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:31.540 huda: I I don't really like doing math once, like on the screen, and you can't like work on it. But yeah. 276 00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.066 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think, like Steven's a great coach. I think 277 00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:47.716 Jenny Duan: like it's been. I. I trust that you're in good hands, and I think that you know hopefully, when it comes out in 2 weeks, I know it'll be much improved, so don't worry too much. It'll be good. 278 00:29:48.340 --> 00:30:00.259 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay. So that's great that that's going. Well, and then how are your classes going like is calculus? I know. Last time you said you got that like one of the high scores in calculus. How? How are your other classes going. 279 00:30:01.582 --> 00:30:17.700 huda: Yeah. So everything's kinda like picking up right now, cause we're all finishing like the course content cause like spring break is coming up. We have like study for Ap exams. So a push we're like on our last unit. And currently, I have. 280 00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:29.350 huda: I still have a B and calc, actually, because because of like like a one homework assignment which didn't submit even though I didn't and I think it was like my last exam as well, but I think. 281 00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:34.009 Jenny Duan: Talk to talk to the teacher, and see if you can submit it late and explain your situation. 282 00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:44.173 huda: Yeah, so like other than that, I think like, all my other classes are at A's right now. So I'm pretty happy about that 283 00:30:44.970 --> 00:31:10.140 huda: And I think in Ap Ling, we're focusing a lot on college essays and stuff right now, because we did this thing activity where it was like, we have to answer questions. So it asks you like stuff about like, what are your passions outside of school? What are your passions inside of school, and then you have to send it to whoever your like, who's writing your recommendation, and then we also have to do like a 284 00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:22.440 huda: practice letter of recommendation email. So I think. And then I and I sent it to like the teacher. That's actually like my English teacher who's actually grading it so hopefully she'll like it. But yeah. 285 00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.310 huda: and then 286 00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:43.050 huda: a push is going pretty well. I have a name in that class right now, and so now we're kind of beginning review. So we're like starting from like the very beginning to the very end. So yeah, it's a bit coming up soon. 287 00:31:44.700 --> 00:32:01.210 huda: oh, yeah, also for for my Ap link, like essays that I have to draft, for, like the common app. I was wondering if you could like help me like choose like an idea cause I already wrote some ideas down for some of them, but like choosing a good one that I can like, continue to expand upon, be great. 288 00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:10.669 Jenny Duan: Definitely, do you have these prompts written out somewhere? Or is it just like the standard ones from online? Okay, do you wanna share your screen or give me a link to that document. 289 00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.509 huda: Yeah, let me 290 00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.320 huda: then. 291 00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.789 huda: actually, it might be like restricted. So let me add, you. 292 00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.960 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, yeah. 1 s, let me request access. I think it is restricted right now. 293 00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.810 Jenny Duan: Okay, I just requested access. 294 00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.109 Jenny Duan: Oh, the other thing headed that's top of mind is 295 00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.130 Jenny Duan: Cameron impact scholarship is due 296 00:32:48.187 --> 00:32:52.480 Jenny Duan: May twenty-second. But I think applying earlier is better. 297 00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.190 Jenny Duan: So let me put that in. 298 00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.879 huda: Do you have to write Esses for that one. 299 00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:06.319 Jenny Duan: This is a basically a college application. I think it's more intense than a college application. So that's it's good that we start early because this one is really intense. 300 00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:07.806 huda: Okay. 301 00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.949 Jenny Duan: Okay, I just sent a request for the document you shared. So whenever you're able to grant, that 302 00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.210 Jenny Duan: would be great. 303 00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.830 huda: Okay, it should. 304 00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.680 huda: It should be shared. 305 00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:32.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 306 00:33:34.177 --> 00:33:38.470 Jenny Duan: And then are these the 5 that you want to write about? 307 00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:46.810 huda: Yeah, one of them is just like right one that you already had. Oh, wait, I need to pick my fifth one. But yeah. 308 00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.959 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me look at the common app prompts, and then we can maybe brainstorm one together. 309 00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.950 Jenny Duan: So for the pick one that you already have? Which one did you choose? 310 00:34:01.159 --> 00:34:03.680 huda: Okay, wait. There's one which says like. 311 00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.559 huda: Oh, wait! Oh, for this one. I had 2 options, and it was like the one about 312 00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.169 huda: I was gonna choose between the one about Steve Jobs and like folklift. 313 00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.529 huda: And then I also was gonna choose between the one about President Barbie, and I 314 00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:28.405 huda: think I'd rather go ahead with like the Steve Jobs. One cause I feel like it tells a little bit more about me 315 00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:34.000 huda: and like my passion in writing cause I don't know if that's gonna be shown in the other essays. 316 00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:44.439 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's a good idea. I like this prompt the one that's like describe a topic ideal concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all, all 317 00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:48.309 Jenny Duan: track of time. I think that's like, Oh, you already chose that. Okay. 318 00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.030 huda: Yeah. 319 00:34:49.636 --> 00:34:50.850 Jenny Duan: Let's see 320 00:34:54.402 --> 00:35:02.280 Jenny Duan: Which kind of time you face a challenge, step back or failure I like. Reflect on time. When you question your challenge to believe for idea. 321 00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.770 Jenny Duan: Did you choose that one? Yet no. 322 00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:05.670 huda: No. 323 00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.339 Jenny Duan: I think out of the last 2, like 324 00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.260 Jenny Duan: the lessons they take from obstacles versus that one. I think that one's better. 325 00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.079 Jenny Duan: What are your thoughts. 326 00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.809 huda: Hmm, yeah, I definitely. 327 00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:28.440 huda: I feel like the if you there's like a lot you can write about about like the the obstacles part. 328 00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:32.020 huda: So maybe like, yeah, avoiding that could be a little bit better. 329 00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 330 00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.569 Jenny Duan: okay, let's 331 00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.366 Jenny Duan: let's do 332 00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:55.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let's do this one. Describe a top or no. The other one, the reflecting on time when you question your challenge to believe or idea what product you're thinking and what was the outcome. This can be like as vague or as specific, that you, as you want 333 00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:02.569 Jenny Duan: so like? Looking at this question, is there any ideas that come to mind in terms of a belief that you've challenged, or something that you've had to deal with. 334 00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:25.170 huda: this is kind of like really cliche, but like like pursuing like anything in like game development and like humanities, and like a South Asian household is a bit like 335 00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.410 huda: kind of 336 00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:39.736 huda: I won't say not for my family too much, but like generally like viewed as a like a bad thing. But I feel like that's kind of like overdone. So maybe you could do something else. 337 00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:49.819 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like, what's something like super unorthodox like? Let's think of a really creative way to tell this 338 00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.180 Jenny Duan: story. 339 00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:58.089 Jenny Duan: like, it can be anything from like, I think what we start with can be something very like 340 00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.370 Jenny Duan: out of the box, and then it can go into a bigger thing. For example, someone might write an essay about like 341 00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.550 Jenny Duan: how 342 00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:31.869 Jenny Duan: They thought that like Kraft, Mac, and cheese is like the best Mac and cheese ever, and then, like they discovered that like, they actually liked another type of Mac and cheese. And they could maybe connect that to like, you know, for example, for the student. Maybe like growing up like taking care of their siblings or something, and like craft, Mac and cheese is like the only thing they knew how to cook, but like they were responsible for carrying, like, you know, nice. You know what I mean. Like, we can take a very normal example and then turn it into something like really special, or 343 00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:51.940 Jenny Duan: I think, like, that's the best way to tell this. The answer. This type of essay, rather than starting from like a really big social concept. Because if someone just said like, Oh, like I I thought it was gonna be easy to care for my siblings within. Like I I realized it was hard like that's not as impactful or memorable as like going in with that like very specific analogy. 344 00:37:53.097 --> 00:38:17.019 huda: Okay, this one is also kind of related to media. So like, like a lot of people like you and my own family they're like, Oh, why are you behind the scenes? That's not as like meaningful, and you might not be as like accredited as like someone who's in front of the camera. But like I think I personally like to be behind the camera. And so like, maybe. 345 00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.759 huda: okay, so like to make that like an analogy. I could be like. 346 00:38:22.136 --> 00:38:24.560 huda: talk about how I used to like 347 00:38:25.021 --> 00:38:33.939 huda: slate people like for their recording, like I feel more confident doing that than actually being in front of the camera. Maybe. 348 00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.520 huda: But I feel like that's also really generic. 349 00:38:37.880 --> 00:39:00.240 Jenny Duan: If you wanted to. Okay, maybe we can think about like, what about you? You want to highlight in this essay cause. Remember, with common apps. It's actually like you're supposed to talk about your entire self, not just something. One thing specific about you so like to be honest, like all of these essays that you're writing. They should all like, reveal the same information about you, but in different forms. Because this is like your common app. This is not like, why do you want to study computer science? It's 350 00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:11.720 Jenny Duan: like, who are you? As a person? So they should all relay the same information, but in different forms. And so I think maybe what we can do is think about like, what is the key information about you that you would want an admissions officer to know, like 351 00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:25.321 Jenny Duan: in 6 50 words, what is important to know about you. Well, first of all, your Muslim, I think that's important. Maybe you're Indian. That's also important. Maybe you're from Mountain House, which is like a pretty rural like farm town. That's like also pretty important to know about you. 352 00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.030 Jenny Duan: What else is important to know about you 353 00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.349 Jenny Duan: as a person not like what you do, but who you are. 354 00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:42.150 huda: So like we also did have to ask our friends about like like to describe ourselves, and like like almost like all of my friends said that I was a good advice, Scammer, so maybe like 355 00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.400 huda: empathetic like. 356 00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.264 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you're empathetic. Yeah, you're also very creative. 357 00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:53.639 Jenny Duan: I'd say you're very diligent, like, you're very on top of everything which is good 358 00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.889 Jenny Duan: thoughts. And then so based on these 359 00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:02.119 Jenny Duan: characters about you, characteristics about you, we can figure out, like. 360 00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:15.370 Jenny Duan: okay, what are the most important issues that you're passionate about okay, AI ethics. It's like one game development. That's another one. When we don't need to necessarily mention all of these things. But it is good to know that these are important to you. 361 00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.460 Jenny Duan: Film story time. 362 00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:18.810 Jenny Duan: So 363 00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.190 Jenny Duan: maybe you can write something about like 364 00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.870 Jenny Duan: storytelling in different ways like 365 00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.725 Jenny Duan: So like something we questioned or challenge. I believe. 366 00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.180 Jenny Duan: I feel like being behind the scenes. 367 00:40:38.887 --> 00:40:44.620 Jenny Duan: Is moving like it's gonna that might be challenging to write about because we still want to 368 00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.509 Jenny Duan: you with leadership potential and like 369 00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.139 huda: You'll be silly. 370 00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.159 Jenny Duan: Like to be behind the scenes too much that could take away from that. 371 00:40:55.276 --> 00:40:57.190 huda: do you think like 372 00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.709 huda: like so storytelling? 373 00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:24.259 huda: maybe like, we could say, like, i feel that child, like, child books, or whatever you call them, children's books. They're like more meaningful and like more impactful than full length novels. And I know that because, like, I've worked with children in like different ways, like through volunteering at the mosque 374 00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:35.029 huda: through making games for younger kids and like empowering AI, and like, I've learned that a lot of them like when you're starting off like when you're 375 00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:50.939 huda: first learning something. It's important to like incorporate storytelling and like empathizing with like students like first learning and like like making it fun to learn. Maybe I guess. 376 00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:58.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Maybe, like one thing you could write about is challenging the belief that, like the only way to tell a story is to 377 00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.340 Jenny Duan: like. 378 00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:07.618 Jenny Duan: tell it directly. But like there's many ways that you can like, inspire and convey information to people in different ways. 379 00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.445 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's not that, like creative or powerful, either. 380 00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:17.870 Jenny Duan: I like this idea about like influencing the future generations or like working with kids. 381 00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.280 Jenny Duan: maybe. 382 00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.990 Jenny Duan: let's see. 383 00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.059 huda: Maybe like one like, let me think of like a certain 384 00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.240 huda: children's book that's like, well, no. 385 00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.160 huda: And then we could like make a comparison. 386 00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.780 huda: a? 387 00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.846 huda: Well, actually, I feel like it's kind of random cause like 388 00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.190 huda: it's not about. It's I feel like it's impersonal. I don't know. 389 00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:09.909 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like it's a bit impersonal as well, like, what's something about you that you feel like you've challenged. I think one thing is like, Okay, I feel like when we first started meeting. You said that you were very shy, but I feel like you're not that shy like you're leading. You're out here leading like tons of things, and I feel like that's 390 00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.209 Jenny Duan: like a that's like a blue like that's like a challenge that you've kind of overcame. 391 00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.440 Jenny Duan: So I think, like that could be something worth writing about. But maybe we think about analogy about how to convey that. 392 00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:42.337 huda: Oh, wait! Maybe like I feel like in person, or like. Actually, I don't know if this is like a good anecdote to say, but like like on student news and everything, I feel like I'm very confident and like I I'm able to show my personality. But in real life. It's like a whole different person. So maybe like challenging like 393 00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:57.389 huda: like when I go on soon news. I feel like I challenge like people. Other people's like perception of me, like like, I guess you know, like it's not the same person like when you're look at me on soon news, and then me into real life. So 394 00:43:57.934 --> 00:44:02.339 huda: I don't know if that's a good talk topic to talk about. But yeah. 395 00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.510 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's good. But I feel like maybe we can think about 396 00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:10.289 Jenny Duan: how to best convey that like through student news or something else. Because I feel like 397 00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:22.150 Jenny Duan: like student news. I feel like that maybe feels a little bit obvious or feels like something that someone else could potentially write, saying that, like, you know, they are a different person on camera versus off camera. But like 398 00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.850 Jenny Duan: woo. 399 00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.360 Jenny Duan: what is something 400 00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.739 Jenny Duan: that you like? Questioned or challenged? 401 00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.459 huda: See if there are any examples on online. 402 00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.530 Jenny Duan: Okay. 403 00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:43.170 Jenny Duan: I don't really understand. To be honest, the point of writing 5 common fs, because I feel like. 404 00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.950 huda: Yeah, and it's due by Friday. 405 00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.450 Jenny Duan: Like it comes. People spend like 3, like. 406 00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.009 Jenny Duan: like, at least one month, 3 to 4 weeks. Yeah. 407 00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:51.350 huda: Yeah. 408 00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:58.030 Jenny Duan: Just write one of these essays. So I feel like it's a bit impractical, and also like to be honest. Not that useful 409 00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:58.910 Jenny Duan: to to. 410 00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:59.290 huda: Friend. 411 00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.040 Jenny Duan: 5 comments. 412 00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:05.029 huda: I think she's just doing it to like, get an idea of like which students she wants to write to. 413 00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.209 Jenny Duan: No. 100%. Yeah. 414 00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.380 Jenny Duan: questioned 415 00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.359 Jenny Duan: or challenge, I believe, or idea. 416 00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.198 huda: I don't know examples, but. 417 00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.629 Jenny Duan: This is not a popular prompt that people feel. Don't want to choose this prompt 418 00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.741 Jenny Duan: for a reason, because it's like kind of tough to write about 419 00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.570 Jenny Duan: charge. 420 00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.459 huda: Someone wrote about like 421 00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.750 huda: traditional generals. 422 00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.180 huda: yes. 423 00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:44.460 huda: that's like really generic. 424 00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:57.698 Jenny Duan: okay, how about this in a video game? Is there a specific move like that? 425 00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:02.360 Jenny Duan: someone. What's okay in your favorite video game like. 426 00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.010 Jenny Duan: actually. 427 00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:10.419 Jenny Duan: tales, buyers. Kind of niche. Is there a game that, like a video game that you play, that many other people might be aware of. 428 00:46:11.236 --> 00:46:12.210 huda: Gallery, maybe. 429 00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.770 Jenny Duan: Valerie. Okay. 430 00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:21.479 Jenny Duan: I would say, maybe not right about Valent. Gets a little bit violent. But like, are there any other games that you play that other people also play. 431 00:46:22.317 --> 00:46:23.870 huda: Star du Valley. 432 00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.677 Jenny Duan: Okay and Study Valley. Is there? 433 00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:39.409 Jenny Duan: are there any strategy games that you play? Because something that I was thinking like one way that you can approach. This essay is like in in a certain game like there's usually one strategy that like people like to take. But like. 434 00:46:39.410 --> 00:47:00.106 Jenny Duan: you can maybe say that in in reality, like the best way to win the game is by doing something like a bit out of the box, or like a bit orthodox like taking a side path that, like not many people, will like play but like that, actually ends up giving you like more more coins in the game, or like helping you defeat something, and then that you can parallel that to your own life and be like, you know, in in 435 00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:22.830 Jenny Duan: in everyday life, like people, emphasize that the only way you can be an effective leader is to like, take initiatives for yourself. But like or maybe like, the only way that you can have an impact in storytelling is to tell the story yourself. But you've learned that like by like helping other people share their stories, or by like empowering other people to discover their own passions. Like you can make a greater impact in like these different ways. 436 00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:31.199 huda: Oh, that sounds great. Maybe I was thinking for games. Maybe like Minecraft, because, like like beating, the game is like a whole like 437 00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:40.190 huda: strategy to doing that. But then there's like, definitely like, quicker ways. And like, yeah, more effective ways. Like, maybe you could talk about that. 438 00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:49.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. Yeah, Minecraft roadblocks like any other game. That kind of involves some type of strategy, I'm sure. Like, if you look on Youtube like there's shortcuts, right? And so you just 439 00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:57.599 Jenny Duan: like, talk about something that like someone might not expect. And then you can connect that back to your own life, and then at the end, you can be like, like. 440 00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.890 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Connect it back to the game if you're like. Next time you're like playing like 441 00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:10.620 Jenny Duan: Minecraft, or leading club, or something, or something, or something like I've learned that, you know. Maybe the best ways aren't always the most direct paths, or you know you can. 442 00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:11.040 huda: Yeah. 443 00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:11.980 Jenny Duan: Powerful ending. 444 00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:19.959 huda: Oh, like. Do you like suggest against using like the word you in your essays? Or because, like it breaks the third wall, or whatever. But. 445 00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:23.426 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I would not say, Hugh, I would say, like, 446 00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.930 Jenny Duan: like, I have learned that like. 447 00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:39.655 Jenny Duan: just do it from your first person perspective. Okay, cool. Okay. I think this sounds good. Then it's due on Friday. I actually, I'm curious to see, like what your essays like. I don't think you need to submit like a very polished. It doesn't have to be like. 448 00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.879 huda: I'm gonna ask if we have to do 6 50 words for each one cause I I. 449 00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:50.819 Jenny Duan: That's like that's not realistic. Like, people spend months threading their common app. It's not realistic to have 5 common apps in. 450 00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.930 huda: Yeah, but. 451 00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.559 Jenny Duan: One week. No way, it's not. 452 00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.255 huda: Yeah. 453 00:48:55.558 --> 00:49:01.231 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I'm curious to see like what your essay turns out after you're done writing it. So send it to me when you're done and 454 00:49:01.904 --> 00:49:11.610 Jenny Duan: cool. Then in that case I will see you on Saturday. Right? Yes, okay. By that time I'll have moved out from my dorm, and I'll be in Florida with my friends. 455 00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:11.960 huda: No. 456 00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:29.669 Jenny Duan: Break. So it's big challenges like, I'm I didn't. I don't know if I told you this, but I'm going abroad in Beijing. It doesn't really impact like my availability or anything. But it just means like I'll be in a different location. But I'm going to study abroad in Beijing. So I'm in the process of like moving out my entire dorm, and like packing and and everything. 457 00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.110 huda: Oh, yeah, that's really cool. So are you going for? The entire summer. 458 00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.289 Jenny Duan: I'm going for the entire spring. And then I'm moving into New York. Actually, I'm entering into New York. 459 00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:37.830 huda: Of course. 460 00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.520 Jenny Duan: So I'll be in New York from like June onwards. But. 461 00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.040 huda: Right. 462 00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.630 Jenny Duan: Like April until June. I'll be in Beijing and China so excited. 463 00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:46.910 huda: That sounds really fun and exciting. 464 00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:56.399 Jenny Duan: Thanks. Yeah. Well, anyways, take care I'll see you in on Saturday, and, thanks for being flexible with the time it's cause I'll be on the east coast so 3 h ahead. So that's fine. 465 00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.610 huda: Yeah, no problem. Thank you so much. 466 00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.380 Jenny Duan: Alright! Take care! Bye.",

It was so fun. And like, just alright, I guess I'm still trying to register that like, probably close, actually like acknowledged me so it's so cool. 7 00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.500 Jenny Duan: Wow! Yeah, awesome. Did you get to meet a lot of other girls like? Do you keep in contact with them at all? 8 00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.349 huda: Yeah, we shared our socials in the slack. And so we just kinda like followed each other. But yeah. 9 00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:09.999 Jenny Duan: Super cool. I think one of the best parts about code of the clock to see is definitely like the alumni community, and being able to know that, you know. Now, if you have like a passion for Cs, or you wanna work in a project, or you you just wanna like talk to someone about coding like there's lots of other people who, you know, share the same share, the same things as you. So super good. 10 00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.600 huda: Yeah. 11 00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.699 Jenny Duan: yay, and did you? You ended up building the skin.

Have you? 14 00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.160 Jenny Duan: Have you done anything with AI before with working in Comml, or anything like that? 15 00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.549 huda: I think this is actually like my first time ever working with like AI, actually. So that was really cool. 16 00:01:32.470 --> 00:",
    "01:38.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's it's another thing that's cool about Komla is for the other camps. They use Google teachable machine. Have you played with that before? 17 00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.850 huda: No. 18 00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.540 Jenny Duan: Maybe it's something that you can even incorporate into like empowering AI sessions. Let me just show you 19 00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.579 Jenny Duan: what it is. 20 00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.750 Jenny Duan: 1 s 21 00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.983 Jenny Duan: but teachable machine is basically this, like Google AI model that you can use and it's another image classifier. So 22 00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:13.419 Jenny Duan: I just sent you a link in the chat. But like, if you press new project, you can make image audio or post project, so it will like, it's basically like Coml, where it categorizes things based on a set of training data. 23 00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.150 Jenny Duan: But 24 00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.734 Jenny Duan: it, it would be cool to maybe incorporate with empowering AI or something like that, too. 25 00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:24.310 Jenny Duan: But Coml is actually an apple proprietary thing that hasn't been released yet, so. 26 00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.560 huda: Whoa! 27 00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.574 Jenny Duan: Largely pretty much only used in 28 00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.599 Jenny Duan: yeah. Only used in covid classy. So Covell is pretty cool. 29 00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:46.990 huda: Cool. Yeah, I think I think some of the people that attended were the ones who made it. Cause. I remember some guy was like coming around and asking us like how our experience with Coml was. So it's pretty cool. 30 00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And it was cool to connect with a lot of apple people. Wasn't it like. 31 00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.340 huda: Yeah. 32 00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.040 Jenny Duan: From all different places. Yeah. 33 00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.020 huda: The panel is really nice, cause ",
    "like 34 00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.620 huda: their like journey was so inspiring, and I was like 35 00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.770 huda: definitely want to be with them. One day. 36 00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.235 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for sure. 37 00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:27.700 Jenny Duan: And then I wanted to kind of do a recap of everything that you're working on. Just so we I know we've been focused on a lot of applications recently, but I kind of wanna do like as spend some time talking about just how your general progress is going and everything. So maybe we can start with like full flipped. Are you still actively pursuing that? And how's that going for you? 38 00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.176 huda: Yeah, so 39 00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:48.102 huda: so actually, this guy, I think he's like a college student or he has, like a nonprofit for like marketing, and he wanted to set up like a 30 min call talking about folklift and like it's mission everything and he just wanted to see like 40 00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:59.180 huda: like, it's just like he's not trying to sell anything he just wants to know, like more about the initiative. So I I that's gonna be like tomorrow at 8? Pm, I think, yeah. 41 00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.090 Jenny Duan: Oh, cool 42 00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.990 Jenny Duan: And 43 00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.410 Jenny Duan: beyond that 44 00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.500 Jenny Duan: How's 45 00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.060 Jenny Duan: how's like the submissions going like? Are people submitting to your journal? How is that going. 46 00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:24.244 huda: Yeah. So oh, yeah, I forgot to mention someone from like my personal Instagram. For like from my school, wrote a poem about like Gaza. So I I'm gonna publish that 47 00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.759 huda: I'm just working on like the code for that and then 48 00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:32.230 huda: and then also someone applied. 49 00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:47.249 huda: I guess, like, you know how I have like the app",
    "lication. For, like the cultural ambassador thing. So there was like someone who applied from there. And then I'm gonna and I emailed them. But like, I just emailed them today. So yeah, we'll see like 50 00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.500 huda: when they send their first work. But yeah. 51 00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think one thing that would be really cool is if you submitted to a 52 00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:09.940 Jenny Duan: like a human rights essay competition. So let me send up a minute to try to find one for you right now. But I feel like, since you are leading this initiative. Booklist, and you're like other people are submitting works it 53 00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.004 Jenny Duan: to me. It makes sense that you submit something, for, like a similar rating competition, 54 00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.290 Jenny Duan: so 55 00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.810 Jenny Duan: give me a second 56 00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.680 Jenny Duan: to do some research. 57 00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.210 huda: Oh, also in English. So my teacher! She's having us write. 58 00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.834 Jenny Duan: There's this, there's one 59 00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:42.620 huda: Oh, sorry. Yeah. My teachers having us write like 5 common app essays. So we're gonna have to already start like brainstorming on that. But yeah, it's kinda scary. 60 00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.039 Jenny Duan: Well, like like 5 drafts of a com, like different essays for the common app. 61 00:05:50.040 --> 00:06:04.699 huda: Yeah, it's I'm I wanna like, make them really good. Cause like, if it's really good. And I feel like she'll kind of see my potential and maybe write like a re letter of recommendation for me. So I'm trying to like, write really good essays. Yeah. 62 00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.080 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 63 00:06:06.003 --> 00:06:09.630 Jenny Duan: Why are you writing 5 different coming up essays. 64 00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:12.889 huda: I have no idea. And then we like 65 00:06:13.060 --> 00",
    ":06:29.439 huda: we have to pick 5 out of the 7. And then actually, one of the prompts is just like put an Essie that you've written for something else before. And so I just use, like one of the ones that I use for the summer applications, and I think I might like reuse some that we wrote together. But yeah. 66 00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.320 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like 5 is a lot, especially since, like, you know, you're not 67 00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.119 Jenny Duan: quite. No, you don't. You don't need 5. But. 68 00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.770 huda: Yeah. 69 00:06:38.087 --> 00:06:50.472 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so okay, I found that competition that I want want you to enter. And I'll make a note of this later. But this is due. I think it's just an essay contest, but it's due. 70 00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.361 Jenny Duan: it's due on April first. But if you win this, you get a 71 00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:07.759 Jenny Duan: You can do semester. S. You get an all expenses paid. Educational voyage. Come over to see a semester. SC. Not really sure what that means. But 72 00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.300 Jenny Duan: I think this is like good for you to for you to enter. 73 00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:17.450 Jenny Duan: Let me look at the current and past winning essays. 74 00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.930 Jenny Duan: I think this is gonna be pretty competitive, because it's. 75 00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.669 Jenny Duan: you know not. 76 00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.239 Jenny Duan: There's only one winner. There's not like, you know, multiple winners. But I think like 77 00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.540 Jenny Duan: doing something like this would be really impressive. This is a a previous winner 78 00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.189 Jenny Duan: can look at this right now. 79 00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.549 Jenny Duan: But I think this is like you just focus on the foreign services 80 00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.830 Jenny Duan: work in something. 81 00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.460 Jenny Duan: This is the hun",
    "dredth years. 82 00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.870 Jenny Duan: It's about foreign American foreign services. 83 00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.440 Jenny Duan: So like us, involvement abroad, I believe. 84 00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.010 Jenny Duan: The pro. 85 00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.660 huda: So like. 86 00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.519 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! 87 00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.930 huda: Oh, sorry. So do you think it like could write something 88 00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.060 huda: about Gaza? Or do you think that would be like kind of controversial. 89 00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.719 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna look at the prompt. It's okay. 90 00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.469 Jenny Duan: What do you believe? 91 00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:18.210 Jenny Duan: Okay, what do you believe is the biggest challenge the foreign service will face. And how do you think American diplomats can mitigate it? 92 00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:22.320 Jenny Duan: So maybe we can think about like, you know. What do you think is the biggest challenge. 93 00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.170 huda: I sorry you're kind of cutting out, but I think the biggest challenge. 94 00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.350 Jenny Duan: Necessarily like the Us. Embassy, and, like all the people you know from the Us. Working in other countries. 95 00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.066 huda: Sorry. I think it it just like cut out. But 96 00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.370 Jenny Duan: But go ahead. 97 00:08:36.610 --> 00:09:00.230 huda: Yeah. So I think the biggest problem is probably like trying to balance like cause. There's one side that that's really pushing for aid. And there's another which is like like the both sides of the argument because of American people, are basically split right now. Between foreign policy with Israel and Gaza and I think maybe like 98 00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:03.663 huda: a solution to that. Maybe like 99 00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.300 huda: offering some sort of like 100 00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.130 huda: like peace like I ",
    "don't explain like ceasefire, but like 101 00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.730 huda: also condemning like 102 00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.678 huda: things that other people 103 00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.469 huda: condemn. You know. 104 00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.080 Jenny Duan: Hmm, yeah. 105 00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.890 huda: Balance in Tucson. 106 00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.983 Jenny Duan: That's good. 107 00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.650 Jenny Duan: yeah, for sure. 108 00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.019 Jenny Duan: I think that that was a really good essay topic. And again, this is 109 00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.259 Jenny Duan: the type of thing where I think, like 110 00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.570 Jenny Duan: you just submit, and then, you see it. It's very low probability of like 111 00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.849 Jenny Duan: winning the award cause. It's only one person, but, like, I think 112 00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.430 Jenny Duan: now, we can start just applying to more and more writing awards, like hopefully, one of them will pay off. 113 00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, on. 114 00:09:51.720 --> 00:10:00.050 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So that's due on April first, let me see if I can find anything else off the top of my head. 115 00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.490 Jenny Duan: Ellen. 116 00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.200 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 117 00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.714 Jenny Duan: Oh. 118 00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.550 Jenny Duan: okay. 119 00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.480 Jenny Duan: I think 120 00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.598 Jenny Duan: I think this is like the most immediate one that hasn't. That doesn't have a 121 00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.020 Jenny Duan: past deadline already. 122 00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.180 Jenny Duan: So 123 00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.180 Jenny Duan: this is good. 124 00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:31.240 Jenny Duan: Oh, also, like Columbia, the Columbia undergraduate Law Review 125 00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.819 Jenny Duan: has an 126 00:10:33.710 --> ",
    "00:10:37.149 Jenny Duan: in essay contests. But I don't think they're open right now. 127 00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:50.680 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I feel like this is a good one to start with, it's due April first. So I would say, for this one. Reading the past essay, it kind of looks like it's like you can do. You have Gpt. 4. By the way. 128 00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.500 huda: Yeah. 129 00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.980 Jenny Duan: Okay 130 00:10:54.544 --> 00:10:56.429 Jenny Duan: a lot of this essay looks. 131 00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:05.579 Jenny Duan: in my opinion, Gpt, formable, because, like the writing style is very formal. So I would say like, don't spend too too much time on it. Just like. 132 00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.631 Jenny Duan: do your research use Tatt and like, submit it. 133 00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:18.430 huda: Yeah, my history teacher about it, because, like she has a, she's really opinionated about like foreign policy and stuff. 134 00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.259 Jenny Duan: Okay. I'm at. 135 00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.420 huda: Oh, sorry! It keeps like cutting out. 136 00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:32.050 Jenny Duan: But the next thing that I wanted to talk about is empowering AI. And then I just wanted to see how that 137 00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.611 Jenny Duan: oh, I think it's my wi-fi here, let me just 138 00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:38.000 Jenny Duan: it's okay. 139 00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.829 Jenny Duan: It's a fun. 140 00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.769 Jenny Duan: and if I go to this part it'll be better let me know if it keeps cutting out after this. Okay. 141 00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.380 huda: Yeah. 142 00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:53.380 Jenny Duan: Okay? So the other thing is wanted to check in on empowering AI, and how that's going? Do you have any updates on that front? 143 00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:10.567 huda: Yeah, this weekend we're gonna be having our last session. Last time I thought like my vice President, would kind of like facilitate that. But she never s",
    "ent out the email or anything. So I guess we're doing like our last one this week. And then, 144 00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:26.749 huda: yeah, I'm gonna like, make this slide show probably like tonight. And and then I was thinking, like, we're gonna start like making certificates and everything for everyone that participated and kind of sending them out virtually 145 00:12:27.474 --> 00:12:29.530 huda: and yeah, I think 146 00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:46.280 huda: I think for future plans. So now I can. I'm gonna start getting like in touch with the keynote speaker that we we're talking with before and then we're gonna make slides for her, and set an actual date for the the event. 147 00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.970 huda: and I think 148 00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:58.159 huda: so. You did. Like give teachable machine for Google. I think it's like a really good tool. So maybe we can just have like a one day like 149 00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:18.040 huda: quick session, with a bunch of kids. And we can just do like teaching about that. But that probably might take some time to get people interested. But yeah, also, since I'm in contact with the school Newsletter. Now I can try asking them to post that there as well. So yeah. 150 00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.380 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds good. I 151 00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:30.190 Jenny Duan: I how do you feel about your your vice President? Not really doing that? That much for empowering AI. Is this a one off issue, or is this a recurring issue. 152 00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:59.873 huda: This is a pretty recurring issue, and like so I think so. I did kind of demote her to publicity director. But then there was like the first first week she kind of got like us a lot of people which kind of just showed up for the first session. But then but yeah, and then I kind of felt bad. And she was looking at the website. She saw that it was like publicity director and not vice president. And she showed it to her parents, and they got really mad. But ye",
    "ah, and 153 00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:12.810 huda: but like, yeah, I feel like she just. I also told her to like, be in charge of the social media and kind of make lots of content for it. And she agreed, but she didn't do anything. So yeah. 154 00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:19.071 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Well, I feel like she shouldn't be upset if her work doesn't translate into the 155 00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.239 Jenny Duan: that shouldn't be something she should view through but I mean, are you looking for another vice President? Or how's that working. 156 00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:41.780 huda: If I if I replace, I don't think that'll go down well, but if I but like if I do find one, I mean. 157 00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:55.779 huda: the thing is like, the problem is, we're even like looking for, like more people to join our team. And we still couldn't find anyone so like finding another person might be difficult. Especially since it's like kind of limited. So we're only doing, girls. 158 00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.930 huda: As the officers are like board members. So 159 00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.249 huda: I'll I'll try to like, look out for like anyone who might be interested. But yeah. 160 00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.714 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I think the other thing you can do is 161 00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:19.539 Jenny Duan: reach out to the code with Clausy network. Once that like discord and circle, I believe, is the other platform. Once that's set up, I would say, try to 162 00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.689 Jenny Duan: get involved with that platform. 163 00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:23.060 huda: Yeah. 164 00:15:24.747 --> 00:15:30.770 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Now, the next thing that I won't talk about is film club, and just how that's going. 165 00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:45.044 huda: Yeah, so I talked with I talked with. So he's a secretary so like, oh, so we talked, and him and me are kind of like again doing like most of the work for the club. So then we decided, we're gonna 166 00:15:45.",
    "350 --> 00:16:02.848 huda: see, like the people that have been like contributing to the club as members. And we we're gonna place them as officers, currently, because, the other people have also just like said, Oh, I I'm fine. I don't really need the officer role anymore. So we're kind of, we're just like replacing them. And then 167 00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:12.739 huda: so we did have sent out our trailers before, but now we're actually on the editing process for the film and then we had like a club president's meeting like 168 00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:35.979 huda: yesterday and so then I had to share about like what we did, and recognition and everything. So I think club recognition is getting pretty well is going pretty well. But then also for promotion on our short film, we're gonna be attending like we have this thing called Culture Night, where all the clubs have to participate. And we're gonna be playing our 169 00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:46.099 huda: short film and like, kind of having some fun activities around that. And also just like kind of filming videos for promotion on our short film. 170 00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.406 Jenny Duan: Super cool. 171 00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:54.190 Jenny Duan: and then after that, after film club, I'm wondering like 172 00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:02.880 Jenny Duan: with film. You're are you still going to be President next year. Is there another election for that? Okay, cool. There's no like election process. 173 00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:16.590 huda: Yeah, it's usually like cause. Usually the President is like in charge of, like, you know, getting the documents and like enrolling your club again. So then that kind of stays the same. But then the rest of the officers kind of change. But 174 00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:17.390 huda: yeah. 175 00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.569 Jenny Duan: So are you. 176 00:17:21.765 --> 00:17:23.440 huda: Sorry you're cutting out again. 177 00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.649 Jenny Duan: Are you paying new officers? And ho",
    "w's that going, or how will that be going. 178 00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.193 huda: Oh, yeah. So for now, 179 00:17:34.670 --> 00:18:02.281 huda: so right now we're usually the elections take place in like the beginning of the year. So like right now. We just have like these new officers or sophomores. Cause they've been like participating a lot the past 2 years. They've been like acting in the short films they've been actively editing. So I offered them those positions of like the officers which aren't really active in our club. So yeah, 180 00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:18.249 huda: yeah. And then next year, we hope to like, have another election. We usually do applications. So then, like the officers like the President, the Vice President, get to decide. Cause. That's what we did this year. And last year. So yeah. 181 00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:27.174 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. And then another question is, have you been able to talk to your vice principal? And how's that like relationship going. 182 00:18:28.414 --> 00:18:36.335 huda: Yeah. So I like, I like, said Hi to her here and there. But I'm I'm still working on getting like a meeting with her 183 00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:46.810 huda: cause. She's kind of busy during the time that like, we have like break. So it's like success sessions. You're basically like flexes. So like. 184 00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.509 huda: yeah, she's kind of busy during that time, but I've been like trying to set up a meeting with her. Still. 185 00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.809 Jenny Duan: Okay, cause we wanna get that nomination for the Reagan leadership prize. 186 00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.860 Jenny Duan: So I think it's important that she does that. 187 00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.849 huda: Do you think? If I like? If I kind of 188 00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.900 huda: talk a bit more to my counselor? Do you think that would be like a valid kind of like source. Maybe. 189 00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:20.679 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think all she ",
    "needs to do. I looked at the right. I looked at it. You only need to write like a short paragraph, and as long as she nominates you, you get the award basically so like it should not be to like 190 00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.144 Jenny Duan: it should not be too much effort on her end. I think. 191 00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:31.969 Jenny Duan: it's due on April fifth. That's why I'm reminding you, because it is like, you know, semi semi soon. So. 192 00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:44.629 huda: Actually, I think my counselor might be really busy cause the counselors are like starting to talk about college and everything. So she might get a bit annoyed. So I'm I'm gonna try a bit more with the vice principal. Maybe. 193 00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.510 Jenny Duan: Okay, but it's April fifth. Just remember this. It can be your principal. It can be, maybe, if your principals willing to help you. That could also be a good thing. 194 00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.429 Jenny Duan: but it can be a principal vice principal, just a school administrator or counselor like 195 00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.840 Jenny Duan: that. All works. 196 00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.135 huda: Okay. Sounds good. 197 00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.814 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and then the other thing is 198 00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:06.840 Jenny Duan: toe. 199 00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:14.049 Jenny Duan: Let me see what else? Oh, yeah, the game. How is that going? And like more so on, like the publicity side. How's that going. 200 00:20:15.332 --> 00:20:30.510 huda: I guess I haven't done much publicity for the game so far. But in April, we're supposed to be filming. The second, podcast which? I'm actually me speaking on. And so so I don't know if I told you this, but like a few. 201 00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.802 huda: maybe like a month ago. Actually 202 00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:52.300 huda: the guy like we have like a call and he told me, like what type of questions he'll be asking. He's talked a lot about AI. So I think a lot of the",
    " questions for me like, Do you think AI is? Gonna take over jobs and stuff like that which I I don't really know, like how that relates to my game. But yeah. 203 00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.790 Jenny Duan: Hmm, okay. 204 00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.589 Jenny Duan: are there any other opportunities that you could take to publicize your game? Do you think. 205 00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:13.130 huda: So I so I did try reaching out to like a few like South Asian journals. Because, like my characters, are South Asian and like. 206 00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.650 Jenny Duan: Could. 207 00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:29.640 huda: So there's like a lot of articles which are like, Oh, here, like representation games. They're kind of not reaching out back so maybe I can try like mass sending, like many, many journals. And then also 208 00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.239 huda: maybe like more podcasts, like, maybe 209 00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.345 huda: yeah, 210 00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.149 huda: all I can think of right now. 211 00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:50.940 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good to me. I'm wondering, how have you started working on like the toolkit and how that's working 212 00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.340 Jenny Duan: like the elementary school, or like the school toolkit. 213 00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:54.930 huda: Oh! 214 00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:55.909 Jenny Duan: With the game. 215 00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:04.720 huda: Yeah, I I didn't really start on that. But I think I I can work on it. This week. Yeah. 216 00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:18.050 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good. Because I think if we can get that mass sent out, that would be really impactful or impressive for you. So I feel like that. That's like something we can click on. Let me make a note to do that. 217 00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:27.302 huda: Oh, yeah, are there any like essays and applications I should be working on right now? 218 00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.490 huda: currently. 219 00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.294 Jenny Duan: Yeah,",
    " that's where we we're gonna get to next. I think right now. 220 00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:39.579 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest you've already submitted many, many, many things, but I think the make noise today would be 221 00:22:40.164 --> 00:22:42.420 Jenny Duan: oh! The application passed. 222 00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.529 huda: So I was a minute. 223 00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.230 Jenny Duan: And I think. 224 00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:58.770 Jenny Duan: oh, perfect. Okay, cool. Thanks. So much for submitting that. I think the next thing is this essay contest. So maybe we can brainstorm and create an outline for that essay contest next. But we've been applying for so many things I'm wondering like. Besides, Notre Dame, have you heard back from anything else yet. 225 00:22:59.634 --> 00:23:01.819 huda: I haven't heard back from any 226 00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.659 huda: other programs. So. 227 00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.048 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. No worries. I'm sure that I'll take up some more time. But 228 00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.019 Jenny Duan: I'd also like to spend some time thinking about your summer, and like most of these programs that 229 00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.200 Jenny Duan: oh, can you hear me. 230 00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.830 huda: Oh, yeah, I get it. 231 00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.599 Jenny Duan: Okay, did I cut out, or can you hear me? 232 00:23:28.128 --> 00:23:28.962 huda: You could have. 233 00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:51.838 Jenny Duan: Okay, sorry about that. Most of the programs that we applied for are not like the whole summer. So I also wanna spend some time thinking about your summer and like how you spend, how we plan to spend like the rest of your summer beyond. These specific programs cause I do feel like, you know. Obviously, there's there's time for you to pursue other things, and to, you know, try new things, too. 234 00:23:53.110 --> 00:24:02.019 Jenny Duan: so what right now do you have any idea of like what you would want to spend the ",
    "summer doing beyond, like the different summer programs that you've applied for. 235 00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:17.939 huda: I think definitely like for empowering AI, I think definitely doing a lot more projects and competitions. I think I was thinking of doing like a mini like hackathon type thing. So it's I. I kinda got inspiration from coderation, but we'd have like 236 00:24:18.677 --> 00:24:21.602 huda: like one tool like we had 237 00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.654 huda: that on the was the applicant. 238 00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.970 Jenny Duan: Teachable machine. 239 00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:38.470 huda: Yeah, like, like, yeah, for example, that and then everyone has to make their own project. And then we kind of judge which one has like the best pitch and everything. So I think that that'll be really 240 00:24:38.722 --> 00:24:48.410 huda: good. And then we could. And then I was thinking, maybe we could have like different age groups, so they could be like one for high schoolers, and then one for middle schoolers and one for younger. But yeah. 241 00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.280 huda: and then 242 00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:52.299 Jenny Duan: Really good, and then 243 00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.370 Jenny Duan: go ahead. 244 00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:11.174 huda: Yeah, I was trying to think, maybe, like, also, like growing my impact for folklift. Oh, yeah. So the San Francis actually got back to me. And they asked for the email just to like forward their communications. But I haven't heard anything back, so I might kind of like follow up again. 245 00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.866 huda: but yeah, 246 00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:20.629 huda: so like, kind of growing more impact with folklife. Maybe writing a lot more articles and getting people I know, to write articles so. 247 00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:42.580 Jenny Duan: That seems really good. I think the other thing is, it would be cool to do something related to game development, because it seems like there's not like a really good re",
    "source for like youth, or especially like young girls interested in game development to pursue that. So maybe, like as part of a partner, AI or something beyond that. You could do like some type of game development program. 248 00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:49.640 Jenny Duan: We're like creating something like an educational resource or educational opportunity to get people inspired in game development. 249 00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:58.024 huda: Yeah. Oh, also on a question. So, oh, yeah, today was my sat so I think. 250 00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.590 Jenny Duan: You took the full sat today. 251 00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.323 huda: Yeah, yeah. 252 00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.079 Jenny Duan: Oh, my! Gosh! How'd it go? 253 00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:28.857 huda: Okay. So I think I did like, I'm pretty confident on my reading. I feel like there weren't any like question. So I know, definitely got harder, because there's like some vocabulary that I didn't know. But I think I wasn't able to make really great choices. And I think reading went really well, and I was expecting a pretty high score. But for math, I think there's like 3 questions that I didn't know how to do for one of them like I like literally physically measured. 254 00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:53.649 huda: one of them so like it was kind of an educated guess. But I I'm not sure how math is gonna go. But so so reading, I I have like really high hopes for reading but yeah. And then I was thinking about like if I get a high score for reading since I already got a 780 in math. What like? And I supersed what are like the drawbacks of supersoring your sat like if there are any. 255 00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:24.180 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think it's just like they can see all your past tests. So they see you like, give me a list of tests regardless. So I think I think it's better obviously to not super score. So hopefully, you did well, on this exam. And don't worry about it being hard, because since you're so well prepared, like, if it's h",
    "ard for you, it's like, gonna Be hard for other people in the curve for compensate. So I would say, don't maybe don't worry about that as much, but I would say like it's better to not superscript. But if you feel confident on your reading, and obviously you did good on math last time. It should be fine. 256 00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.249 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 257 00:27:27.255 --> 00:27:28.080 huda: Yeah. 258 00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.540 Jenny Duan: Wow! I can't believe it was today on a Wednesday. Was it at school, or was it at. 259 00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.880 huda: Yeah, I was at school. 260 00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.420 Jenny Duan: Did a lot of other people do it? 261 00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.030 huda: Yeah, there's like, I think a hundred 20 people taking it in our test center. 262 00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.190 Jenny Duan: Oh, wow! Yeah. How did do you know how other people felt about it at all? 263 00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.972 huda: A lot of people felt like the reading was really bad. 264 00:27:50.540 --> 00:28:07.409 huda: then, I think math like module 2. Everyone was like, oh, this did not go well and cause there's like a question where, like, you're given 2 points on a circle, and then you're supposed to find, like the tangent of the degree. And it's like, really confusing. But yeah. 265 00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.084 Jenny Duan: Hmm, oh, wow! 266 00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:17.779 Jenny Duan: okay. Well, I think if you I mean, if you feel confident in reading and like no one else does, that's like a really good sign. First of all. 267 00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:23.310 Jenny Duan: and how does it? How did you feel about this one compared to your last, your like previous exam? 268 00:28:24.588 --> 00:28:27.969 huda: I think definitely like or like the one on paper. 269 00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.259 Jenny Duan: Yeah. The one on paper. 270 00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:41.159 huda: I think this new format of like reading is. I don't know if it's because I've been l",
    "ike practicing a lot with Steven and everything. But like the questions are a lot more like. 271 00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:59.430 huda: like, I feel like, you can understand that this is this type of question. And like you can like attack it a certain way. Cause, for example, there's like one where it gives you like a bunch of data. And then you're supposed to like make a sentence which combines all that, and it's like really easy to do so like 272 00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:20.720 huda: I just feel like a reading like the shorter passages are also nicer for me, cause I'm able to like pay attention the entire time. But like math, I just and also like another part about the reading is, it's kinda hard to annotate cause you have to like highlight, and then I click a button. So it's like a bit difficult. But like other than that. Reading's fine. But math 273 00:29:21.002 --> 00:29:21.929 huda: I just feel like. 274 00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.599 huda: Like having it on a screen is just kind of like 275 00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:31.540 huda: I I don't really like doing math once, like on the screen, and you can't like work on it. But yeah. 276 00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.066 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think, like Steven's a great coach. I think 277 00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:47.716 Jenny Duan: like it's been. I. I trust that you're in good hands, and I think that you know hopefully, when it comes out in 2 weeks, I know it'll be much improved, so don't worry too much. It'll be good. 278 00:29:48.340 --> 00:30:00.259 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay. So that's great that that's going. Well, and then how are your classes going like is calculus? I know. Last time you said you got that like one of the high scores in calculus. How? How are your other classes going. 279 00:30:01.582 --> 00:30:17.700 huda: Yeah. So everything's kinda like picking up right now, cause we're all finishing like the course content cause like spring break is coming up. We have like study for Ap exams. So a push we're like on ",
    "our last unit. And currently, I have. 280 00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:29.350 huda: I still have a B and calc, actually, because because of like like a one homework assignment which didn't submit even though I didn't and I think it was like my last exam as well, but I think. 281 00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:34.009 Jenny Duan: Talk to talk to the teacher, and see if you can submit it late and explain your situation. 282 00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:44.173 huda: Yeah, so like other than that, I think like, all my other classes are at A's right now. So I'm pretty happy about that 283 00:30:44.970 --> 00:31:10.140 huda: And I think in Ap Ling, we're focusing a lot on college essays and stuff right now, because we did this thing activity where it was like, we have to answer questions. So it asks you like stuff about like, what are your passions outside of school? What are your passions inside of school, and then you have to send it to whoever your like, who's writing your recommendation, and then we also have to do like a 284 00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:22.440 huda: practice letter of recommendation email. So I think. And then I and I sent it to like the teacher. That's actually like my English teacher who's actually grading it so hopefully she'll like it. But yeah. 285 00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.310 huda: and then 286 00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:43.050 huda: a push is going pretty well. I have a name in that class right now, and so now we're kind of beginning review. So we're like starting from like the very beginning to the very end. So yeah, it's a bit coming up soon. 287 00:31:44.700 --> 00:32:01.210 huda: oh, yeah, also for for my Ap link, like essays that I have to draft, for, like the common app. I was wondering if you could like help me like choose like an idea cause I already wrote some ideas down for some of them, but like choosing a good one that I can like, continue to expand upon, be great. 288 00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:10.669 Jenny Duan: Definitely, do you have these prompts written out s",
    "omewhere? Or is it just like the standard ones from online? Okay, do you wanna share your screen or give me a link to that document. 289 00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.509 huda: Yeah, let me 290 00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.320 huda: then. 291 00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.789 huda: actually, it might be like restricted. So let me add, you. 292 00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.960 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, yeah. 1 s, let me request access. I think it is restricted right now. 293 00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.810 Jenny Duan: Okay, I just requested access. 294 00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.109 Jenny Duan: Oh, the other thing headed that's top of mind is 295 00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.130 Jenny Duan: Cameron impact scholarship is due 296 00:32:48.187 --> 00:32:52.480 Jenny Duan: May twenty-second. But I think applying earlier is better. 297 00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.190 Jenny Duan: So let me put that in. 298 00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.879 huda: Do you have to write Esses for that one. 299 00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:06.319 Jenny Duan: This is a basically a college application. I think it's more intense than a college application. So that's it's good that we start early because this one is really intense. 300 00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:07.806 huda: Okay. 301 00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.949 Jenny Duan: Okay, I just sent a request for the document you shared. So whenever you're able to grant, that 302 00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.210 Jenny Duan: would be great. 303 00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.830 huda: Okay, it should. 304 00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.680 huda: It should be shared. 305 00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:32.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 306 00:33:34.177 --> 00:33:38.470 Jenny Duan: And then are these the 5 that you want to write about? 307 00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:46.810 huda: Yeah, one of them is just like right one that you already had. Oh, wait, I need to pick my fifth one. But yeah. 308 00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.959 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me look at the common app prompts, and then we can maybe brainstorm one together. ",
    "309 00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.950 Jenny Duan: So for the pick one that you already have? Which one did you choose? 310 00:34:01.159 --> 00:34:03.680 huda: Okay, wait. There's one which says like. 311 00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.559 huda: Oh, wait! Oh, for this one. I had 2 options, and it was like the one about 312 00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.169 huda: I was gonna choose between the one about Steve Jobs and like folklift. 313 00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.529 huda: And then I also was gonna choose between the one about President Barbie, and I 314 00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:28.405 huda: think I'd rather go ahead with like the Steve Jobs. One cause I feel like it tells a little bit more about me 315 00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:34.000 huda: and like my passion in writing cause I don't know if that's gonna be shown in the other essays. 316 00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:44.439 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's a good idea. I like this prompt the one that's like describe a topic ideal concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all, all 317 00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:48.309 Jenny Duan: track of time. I think that's like, Oh, you already chose that. Okay. 318 00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.030 huda: Yeah. 319 00:34:49.636 --> 00:34:50.850 Jenny Duan: Let's see 320 00:34:54.402 --> 00:35:02.280 Jenny Duan: Which kind of time you face a challenge, step back or failure I like. Reflect on time. When you question your challenge to believe for idea. 321 00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.770 Jenny Duan: Did you choose that one? Yet no. 322 00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:05.670 huda: No. 323 00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.339 Jenny Duan: I think out of the last 2, like 324 00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.260 Jenny Duan: the lessons they take from obstacles versus that one. I think that one's better. 325 00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.079 Jenny Duan: What are your thoughts. 326 00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.809 huda: Hmm, yeah, I definitely. 327 00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:28.440 huda: I feel like the if you there's like a lot you can write about about li",
    "ke the the obstacles part. 328 00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:32.020 huda: So maybe like, yeah, avoiding that could be a little bit better. 329 00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 330 00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.569 Jenny Duan: okay, let's 331 00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.366 Jenny Duan: let's do 332 00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:55.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let's do this one. Describe a top or no. The other one, the reflecting on time when you question your challenge to believe or idea what product you're thinking and what was the outcome. This can be like as vague or as specific, that you, as you want 333 00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:02.569 Jenny Duan: so like? Looking at this question, is there any ideas that come to mind in terms of a belief that you've challenged, or something that you've had to deal with. 334 00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:25.170 huda: this is kind of like really cliche, but like like pursuing like anything in like game development and like humanities, and like a South Asian household is a bit like 335 00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.410 huda: kind of 336 00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:39.736 huda: I won't say not for my family too much, but like generally like viewed as a like a bad thing. But I feel like that's kind of like overdone. So maybe you could do something else. 337 00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:49.819 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like, what's something like super unorthodox like? Let's think of a really creative way to tell this 338 00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.180 Jenny Duan: story. 339 00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:58.089 Jenny Duan: like, it can be anything from like, I think what we start with can be something very like 340 00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.370 Jenny Duan: out of the box, and then it can go into a bigger thing. For example, someone might write an essay about like 341 00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.550 Jenny Duan: how 342 00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:31.869 Jenny Duan: They thought that like Kraft, Mac, and cheese is like the best Mac and cheese ever, and then, like they discovered that lik",
    "e, they actually liked another type of Mac and cheese. And they could maybe connect that to like, you know, for example, for the student. Maybe like growing up like taking care of their siblings or something, and like craft, Mac and cheese is like the only thing they knew how to cook, but like they were responsible for carrying, like, you know, nice. You know what I mean. Like, we can take a very normal example and then turn it into something like really special, or 343 00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:51.940 Jenny Duan: I think, like, that's the best way to tell this. The answer. This type of essay, rather than starting from like a really big social concept. Because if someone just said like, Oh, like I I thought it was gonna be easy to care for my siblings within. Like I I realized it was hard like that's not as impactful or memorable as like going in with that like very specific analogy. 344 00:37:53.097 --> 00:38:17.019 huda: Okay, this one is also kind of related to media. So like, like a lot of people like you and my own family they're like, Oh, why are you behind the scenes? That's not as like meaningful, and you might not be as like accredited as like someone who's in front of the camera. But like I think I personally like to be behind the camera. And so like, maybe. 345 00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.759 huda: okay, so like to make that like an analogy. I could be like. 346 00:38:22.136 --> 00:38:24.560 huda: talk about how I used to like 347 00:38:25.021 --> 00:38:33.939 huda: slate people like for their recording, like I feel more confident doing that than actually being in front of the camera. Maybe. 348 00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.520 huda: But I feel like that's also really generic. 349 00:38:37.880 --> 00:39:00.240 Jenny Duan: If you wanted to. Okay, maybe we can think about like, what about you? You want to highlight in this essay cause. Remember, with common apps. It's actually like you're supposed to talk about your entire self, not just something. One thing specif",
    "ic about you so like to be honest, like all of these essays that you're writing. They should all like, reveal the same information about you, but in different forms. Because this is like your common app. This is not like, why do you want to study computer science? It's 350 00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:11.720 Jenny Duan: like, who are you? As a person? So they should all relay the same information, but in different forms. And so I think maybe what we can do is think about like, what is the key information about you that you would want an admissions officer to know, like 351 00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:25.321 Jenny Duan: in 6 50 words, what is important to know about you. Well, first of all, your Muslim, I think that's important. Maybe you're Indian. That's also important. Maybe you're from Mountain House, which is like a pretty rural like farm town. That's like also pretty important to know about you. 352 00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.030 Jenny Duan: What else is important to know about you 353 00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.349 Jenny Duan: as a person not like what you do, but who you are. 354 00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:42.150 huda: So like we also did have to ask our friends about like like to describe ourselves, and like like almost like all of my friends said that I was a good advice, Scammer, so maybe like 355 00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.400 huda: empathetic like. 356 00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.264 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you're empathetic. Yeah, you're also very creative. 357 00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:53.639 Jenny Duan: I'd say you're very diligent, like, you're very on top of everything which is good 358 00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.889 Jenny Duan: thoughts. And then so based on these 359 00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:02.119 Jenny Duan: characters about you, characteristics about you, we can figure out, like. 360 00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:15.370 Jenny Duan: okay, what are the most important issues that you're passionate about okay, AI ethics. It's like one game development. That's another one. When we don't ",
    "need to necessarily mention all of these things. But it is good to know that these are important to you. 361 00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.460 Jenny Duan: Film story time. 362 00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:18.810 Jenny Duan: So 363 00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.190 Jenny Duan: maybe you can write something about like 364 00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.870 Jenny Duan: storytelling in different ways like 365 00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.725 Jenny Duan: So like something we questioned or challenge. I believe. 366 00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.180 Jenny Duan: I feel like being behind the scenes. 367 00:40:38.887 --> 00:40:44.620 Jenny Duan: Is moving like it's gonna that might be challenging to write about because we still want to 368 00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.509 Jenny Duan: you with leadership potential and like 369 00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.139 huda: You'll be silly. 370 00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.159 Jenny Duan: Like to be behind the scenes too much that could take away from that. 371 00:40:55.276 --> 00:40:57.190 huda: do you think like 372 00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.709 huda: like so storytelling? 373 00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:24.259 huda: maybe like, we could say, like, i feel that child, like, child books, or whatever you call them, children's books. They're like more meaningful and like more impactful than full length novels. And I know that because, like, I've worked with children in like different ways, like through volunteering at the mosque 374 00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:35.029 huda: through making games for younger kids and like empowering AI, and like, I've learned that a lot of them like when you're starting off like when you're 375 00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:50.939 huda: first learning something. It's important to like incorporate storytelling and like empathizing with like students like first learning and like like making it fun to learn. Maybe I guess. 376 00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:58.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Maybe, like one thing you could write about is challenging the belief that, like the onl",
    "y way to tell a story is to 377 00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.340 Jenny Duan: like. 378 00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:07.618 Jenny Duan: tell it directly. But like there's many ways that you can like, inspire and convey information to people in different ways. 379 00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.445 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's not that, like creative or powerful, either. 380 00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:17.870 Jenny Duan: I like this idea about like influencing the future generations or like working with kids. 381 00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.280 Jenny Duan: maybe. 382 00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.990 Jenny Duan: let's see. 383 00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.059 huda: Maybe like one like, let me think of like a certain 384 00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.240 huda: children's book that's like, well, no. 385 00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.160 huda: And then we could like make a comparison. 386 00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.780 huda: a? 387 00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.846 huda: Well, actually, I feel like it's kind of random cause like 388 00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.190 huda: it's not about. It's I feel like it's impersonal. I don't know. 389 00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:09.909 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like it's a bit impersonal as well, like, what's something about you that you feel like you've challenged. I think one thing is like, Okay, I feel like when we first started meeting. You said that you were very shy, but I feel like you're not that shy like you're leading. You're out here leading like tons of things, and I feel like that's 390 00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.209 Jenny Duan: like a that's like a blue like that's like a challenge that you've kind of overcame. 391 00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.440 Jenny Duan: So I think, like that could be something worth writing about. But maybe we think about analogy about how to convey that. 392 00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:42.337 huda: Oh, wait! Maybe like I feel like in person, or like. Actually, I don't know if this is like a good anecdote to say, but like like on student news and everyth",
    "ing, I feel like I'm very confident and like I I'm able to show my personality. But in real life. It's like a whole different person. So maybe like challenging like 393 00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:57.389 huda: like when I go on soon news. I feel like I challenge like people. Other people's like perception of me, like like, I guess you know, like it's not the same person like when you're look at me on soon news, and then me into real life. So 394 00:43:57.934 --> 00:44:02.339 huda: I don't know if that's a good talk topic to talk about. But yeah. 395 00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.510 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's good. But I feel like maybe we can think about 396 00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:10.289 Jenny Duan: how to best convey that like through student news or something else. Because I feel like 397 00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:22.150 Jenny Duan: like student news. I feel like that maybe feels a little bit obvious or feels like something that someone else could potentially write, saying that, like, you know, they are a different person on camera versus off camera. But like 398 00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.850 Jenny Duan: woo. 399 00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.360 Jenny Duan: what is something 400 00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.739 Jenny Duan: that you like? Questioned or challenged? 401 00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.459 huda: See if there are any examples on online. 402 00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.530 Jenny Duan: Okay. 403 00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:43.170 Jenny Duan: I don't really understand. To be honest, the point of writing 5 common fs, because I feel like. 404 00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.950 huda: Yeah, and it's due by Friday. 405 00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.450 Jenny Duan: Like it comes. People spend like 3, like. 406 00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.009 Jenny Duan: like, at least one month, 3 to 4 weeks. Yeah. 407 00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:51.350 huda: Yeah. 408 00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:58.030 Jenny Duan: Just write one of these essays. So I feel like it's a bit impractical, and also like to be honest. Not that us",
    "eful 409 00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:58.910 Jenny Duan: to to. 410 00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:59.290 huda: Friend. 411 00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.040 Jenny Duan: 5 comments. 412 00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:05.029 huda: I think she's just doing it to like, get an idea of like which students she wants to write to. 413 00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.209 Jenny Duan: No. 100%. Yeah. 414 00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.380 Jenny Duan: questioned 415 00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.359 Jenny Duan: or challenge, I believe, or idea. 416 00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.198 huda: I don't know examples, but. 417 00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.629 Jenny Duan: This is not a popular prompt that people feel. Don't want to choose this prompt 418 00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.741 Jenny Duan: for a reason, because it's like kind of tough to write about 419 00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.570 Jenny Duan: charge. 420 00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.459 huda: Someone wrote about like 421 00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.750 huda: traditional generals. 422 00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.180 huda: yes. 423 00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:44.460 huda: that's like really generic. 424 00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:57.698 Jenny Duan: okay, how about this in a video game? Is there a specific move like that? 425 00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:02.360 Jenny Duan: someone. What's okay in your favorite video game like. 426 00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.010 Jenny Duan: actually. 427 00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:10.419 Jenny Duan: tales, buyers. Kind of niche. Is there a game that, like a video game that you play, that many other people might be aware of. 428 00:46:11.236 --> 00:46:12.210 huda: Gallery, maybe. 429 00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.770 Jenny Duan: Valerie. Okay. 430 00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:21.479 Jenny Duan: I would say, maybe not right about Valent. Gets a little bit violent. But like, are there any other games that you play that other people also play. 431 00:46:22.317 --> 00:46:23.870 huda: Star du Valley. 432 00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.677 Jenny Duan: Okay and Study Valley. Is there? 433 00:46:",
    "27.680 --> 00:46:39.409 Jenny Duan: are there any strategy games that you play? Because something that I was thinking like one way that you can approach. This essay is like in in a certain game like there's usually one strategy that like people like to take. But like. 434 00:46:39.410 --> 00:47:00.106 Jenny Duan: you can maybe say that in in reality, like the best way to win the game is by doing something like a bit out of the box, or like a bit orthodox like taking a side path that, like not many people, will like play but like that, actually ends up giving you like more more coins in the game, or like helping you defeat something, and then that you can parallel that to your own life and be like, you know, in in 435 00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:22.830 Jenny Duan: in everyday life, like people, emphasize that the only way you can be an effective leader is to like, take initiatives for yourself. But like or maybe like, the only way that you can have an impact in storytelling is to tell the story yourself. But you've learned that like by like helping other people share their stories, or by like empowering other people to discover their own passions. Like you can make a greater impact in like these different ways. 436 00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:31.199 huda: Oh, that sounds great. Maybe I was thinking for games. Maybe like Minecraft, because, like like beating, the game is like a whole like 437 00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:40.190 huda: strategy to doing that. But then there's like, definitely like, quicker ways. And like, yeah, more effective ways. Like, maybe you could talk about that. 438 00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:49.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems good. Yeah, Minecraft roadblocks like any other game. That kind of involves some type of strategy, I'm sure. Like, if you look on Youtube like there's shortcuts, right? And so you just 439 00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:57.599 Jenny Duan: like, talk about something that like someone might not expect. And then you can connect that back to your own li",
    "fe, and then at the end, you can be like, like. 440 00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.890 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Connect it back to the game if you're like. Next time you're like playing like 441 00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:10.620 Jenny Duan: Minecraft, or leading club, or something, or something, or something like I've learned that, you know. Maybe the best ways aren't always the most direct paths, or you know you can. 442 00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:11.040 huda: Yeah. 443 00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:11.980 Jenny Duan: Powerful ending. 444 00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:19.959 huda: Oh, like. Do you like suggest against using like the word you in your essays? Or because, like it breaks the third wall, or whatever. But. 445 00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:23.426 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I would not say, Hugh, I would say, like, 446 00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.930 Jenny Duan: like, I have learned that like. 447 00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:39.655 Jenny Duan: just do it from your first person perspective. Okay, cool. Okay. I think this sounds good. Then it's due on Friday. I actually, I'm curious to see, like what your essays like. I don't think you need to submit like a very polished. It doesn't have to be like. 448 00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.879 huda: I'm gonna ask if we have to do 6 50 words for each one cause I I. 449 00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:50.819 Jenny Duan: That's like that's not realistic. Like, people spend months threading their common app. It's not realistic to have 5 common apps in. 450 00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.930 huda: Yeah, but. 451 00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.559 Jenny Duan: One week. No way, it's not. 452 00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.255 huda: Yeah. 453 00:48:55.558 --> 00:49:01.231 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I'm curious to see like what your essay turns out after you're done writing it. So send it to me when you're done and 454 00:49:01.904 --> 00:49:11.610 Jenny Duan: cool. Then in that case I will see you on Saturday. Right? Yes, okay. By that time I'll have moved out from my dorm, and I'll be in Florida wi",
    "th my friends. 455 00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:11.960 huda: No. 456 00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:29.669 Jenny Duan: Break. So it's big challenges like, I'm I didn't. I don't know if I told you this, but I'm going abroad in Beijing. It doesn't really impact like my availability or anything. But it just means like I'll be in a different location. But I'm going to study abroad in Beijing. So I'm in the process of like moving out my entire dorm, and like packing and and everything. 457 00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.110 huda: Oh, yeah, that's really cool. So are you going for? The entire summer. 458 00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.289 Jenny Duan: I'm going for the entire spring. And then I'm moving into New York. Actually, I'm entering into New York. 459 00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:37.830 huda: Of course. 460 00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.520 Jenny Duan: So I'll be in New York from like June onwards. But. 461 00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.040 huda: Right. 462 00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.630 Jenny Duan: Like April until June. I'll be in Beijing and China so excited. 463 00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:46.910 huda: That sounds really fun and exciting. 464 00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:56.399 Jenny Duan: Thanks. Yeah. Well, anyways, take care I'll see you in on Saturday, and, thanks for being flexible with the time it's cause I'll be on the east coast so 3 h ahead. So that's fine. 465 00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.610 huda: Yeah, no problem. Thank you so much. 466 00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.380 Jenny Duan: Alright! Take care! Bye."
