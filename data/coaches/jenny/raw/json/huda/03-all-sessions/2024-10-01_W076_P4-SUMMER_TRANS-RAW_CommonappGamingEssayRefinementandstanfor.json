Do you feel comfortable with the state at which your common app is progressing? Do you want any feedback on that yet? Or do you want to just keep working on that. 2 00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:40.460 huda: Yeah, I think I mean, like, maybe you can like 3 00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.939 huda: look at it right now and see if I'm like headed off to like a good start, and then I can from there. 4 00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.359 Jenny Duan: Sure sounds good. Let me just open that up right now. 5 00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.717 Jenny Duan: This is great. 6 00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.130 huda: Minutes. 7 00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:44.219 Jenny Duan: I wonder here if you can. Okay, I'm just gonna write some small notes. These are things that I want you to just ignore for now. But I'm just writing down so I can remember later. But these are like small details. 8 00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.320 Jenny Duan: okay. 9 00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.020 Jenny Duan: actually, not gonna delete anything I'll just suggest. For now 10 00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.350 Jenny Duan: you can ignore these suggestions. Don't do anything with them until you're done writing the essay. 11 00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.850 Jenny Duan: See? 12 00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.800 Jenny Duan: Shit. 13 00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.240 Jenny Duan: I've these. I'm gonna talk through these comments, but I'm just gonna read through it and like, write everything down before I start talking. 14 00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.899 Jenny Duan: Okay, I love this. I feel like this is much better than your earlier drafts. What do you think. 15 00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:13.920 huda: Yeah, I think. I think I definitely am able to show my personality a little bit better here. And then also, like I wanted to continue it by talking about like developing synthoria. So I think, like there's 2 kind of aspects of growth that I can show here like for one. I can show like, how 16 00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.259 huda: I used to like play video games and think that like 17 00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:31.360 huda: and before, like my identity, I could only play one game. I could only be one thing, but then, like video games taught me that I can like be different things. And then I also applied that to in your life. So that's 1 factor of my growth, and then another. 18 00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.900 Jenny Duan: All right. 19 00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:43.269 huda: Can be applied like when I'm talking about synthoria and like how I decided I wanted to like go for like Muslim Indian characters, because, like, that's like. 20 00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:51.210 huda: I guess, a way of spreading different or like, I guess, spreading like the prominence of my identity. And like. 21 00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.900 huda: yeah, I guess I can't really articulate it, but I think that's like the second aspect of growth. So I think 22 00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.239 huda: this one's a really good for 23 00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.970 huda: showing my growth in comparison to the other ones that I did. 24 00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.230 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I really like this, I think that one thing that we might want to approach when 25 00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.430 Jenny Duan: considering, like all of your essays in context is. 26 00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:31.500 Jenny Duan: I wanna see, because I know that you write about a lot. So I don't want it to feel like too repetitive with your with video games as a theme for showing in other essays. I don't think that that's the case with your 1st Stanford supplemental, but that's just like one thing that we should keep in mind to just not make it too repetitive about video games. Because 27 00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.160 Jenny Duan: I think you, you write a lot about video games and like not that it's too repetitive right now, but like. 28 00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.793 Jenny Duan: I think that's something that we should consider. 29 00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.639 huda: Was something that I was like a bit concerned about because for, like the Sanford like for the 1st supplemental. 30 00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:56.570 huda: it's about like something that I'm curious on, and it's about like gamified education. And then I guess in the beginning I kind of brush upon that about like how video games can like 31 00:06:56.973 --> 00:07:07.000 huda: help educate. So I don't want it to like like you said like sound the same, or be repetitive. But like, yeah, I don't know how to frame it differently. Then. 32 00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:15.930 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like, this is a good, I think. Let's just. The common app is the most important essay. So I feel like this is 33 00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.640 Jenny Duan: good so far. So let's go like line by line, and 34 00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.940 Jenny Duan: talk about some of the 35 00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.390 Jenny Duan: details that I wrote down. So this is great. 36 00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.829 Jenny Duan: The next hour you're managing a pizza franchise generating 37 00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.230 Jenny Duan: yeah. 38 00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:48.819 Jenny Duan: Some figure income at 7 years old, maybe. Say something like make an allusion to entrepreneurship like a budding young entrepreneur don't like maybe not this exact mind, but like something like that. Add how you're like 39 00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.009 Jenny Duan: emphasizing that you're entrepreneurial because I feel like that's a good quality to emphasize. 40 00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.490 Jenny Duan: I love this subtots. 41 00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:09.000 Jenny Duan: hey! Since you say that you write 7 twice, you could maybe delete it in one of these 2 places. I would maybe delete it here, and just 42 00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.759 Jenny Duan: keep the sentence. 43 00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:18.609 huda: Yeah. Wait. What if I wrote like after the generating a 7 figure income? 44 00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:24.009 huda: And I could be like Mark Cuban has nothing on me, or like something like that. 45 00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.950 huda: How about. 46 00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:30.380 Jenny Duan: I don't think I would write that because I don't think you should make an allusion to any specific people 47 00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.800 Jenny Duan: there. 48 00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 49 00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.389 Jenny Duan: I live Vicussey through 50 00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.720 Jenny Duan: video games. 51 00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.420 Jenny Duan: So now you're going from like the past to the present tense. 52 00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.990 Jenny Duan: Is it true that you live vicariously through video games? Or I, I might consider rephrasing this to another phrase. 53 00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.599 Jenny Duan: because I don't feel like it's like that you live vicariously through video games. I think it's something different. 54 00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:06.250 Jenny Duan: Would you agree or disagree? I'm not sure. How would you describe your experience with video games? 55 00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:17.600 huda: Well, I think like the point of the essay is about like how I like I live like when I play like Minecraft. I feel like adventurous 56 00:09:18.012 --> 00:09:28.950 huda: and then, when I when I like play, probably, for example, I can like feel like an entrepreneur, and that's like I guess that was like the point of 57 00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.909 huda: like playing these games. Is that like, I got to experience these different 58 00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:41.749 huda: I guess lives. And so that's kind of like the way I worded it that I live vicariously through them. 59 00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.169 huda: I don't know if it like works in this specific sentence, but I feel like 60 00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.610 huda: like in general. I think I'd say that I do live vicariously through video game characters. 61 00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:59.290 huda: Maybe and I also wanted to touch upon that when I'm talking about synthloria, because there could be people like 62 00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.259 huda: vicariously living through like San and Yaski. 63 00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.630 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could say, like. 64 00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.220 Jenny Duan: through video games. 65 00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.490 Jenny Duan: I experience like, Is there a warp 66 00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:32.949 Jenny Duan: not positive, but like maybe a more educational spin we could do on this like, maybe, like through video games, I 67 00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:42.049 Jenny Duan: live out my different lives as a blank or as blank and like maybe instead of Minecraft. You could use other like 68 00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.579 Jenny Duan: or relevant allergies 69 00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.890 Jenny Duan: or 70 00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.120 Jenny Duan: cause. I feel like living vicariously through video games seems like 71 00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.400 Jenny Duan: a bit of a negative connotation. 72 00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:53.850 huda: Oh, 73 00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.270 huda: In that case, maybe 74 00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.090 huda: Maybe you could like. 75 00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:14.469 huda: you know how people put like different hats on, for, like the different like personalities and things. I think, like, maybe I can maybe like refer to video games as like the different hats. And I can like, maybe, like, put on my 76 00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:24.293 huda: like desk receptionist hat, where I'm like throwing like like paper into the trash, or like I can put on my 77 00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.360 huda: like 78 00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.069 huda: like, for example. 79 00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:43.809 huda: an adventure spirit from like the game like and or like an explorer in Zelda. And like, maybe, like my video, the video games. I don't know if this like has too many analogies, because I know we already have, like the game analogy happening 80 00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:53.220 huda: or like reference happening. But like, yeah, I could like maybe talk about like the games being like my different hats, and like putting on like different identities. 81 00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.210 Jenny Duan: Okay, 82 00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.470 Jenny Duan: let's see. 83 00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.199 Jenny Duan: maybe like, Oh, yeah, I think, like. 84 00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:28.189 Jenny Duan: basically, what I think is like for this question, living vicariously implies that there's like something about this life in the video game that you don't already have in your life, or that's missing from your life like you live vicariously through someone else because you can't gain that experience for yourself. So what about these video games? Do you want to emphasize for yourself, or like? What can't you experience in your own life that you have to seek out in the video game. I think that's what I'm trying to get at here. 85 00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.347 huda: Oh, yeah, I think just like 86 00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:38.329 huda: especially as like when I was, I played these games like when I was younger. So I think there's like lots of boundaries like, for example. 87 00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.370 huda: like taking from, like some of the past essays that we read last meeting. 88 00:12:43.852 --> 00:12:54.189 huda: like maybe credibility or age and like, for example, I can't go and slay a dragon but like in the in the game, I can. 89 00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.790 huda: or like I could have like a pizza business, but I can't like I can in the game. 90 00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.119 Jenny Duan: Okay, wait. Why can't you have a pizza pistos? And why is that important to you? 91 00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.570 huda: Because I think. 92 00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:14.499 huda: okay, well, I like, one thing is that I was like, I've kind of been like adventurous when I was younger like. Okay. 93 00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.683 huda: relating to the Minecraft example that like. 94 00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:35.340 huda: I've been adventurous. But just like I never got these experiences like, obviously, I can't say dragon, but like, and also like opening a pizza shop would, was important to me, because, like, I got the experience of, you know, dealing with customers, and like 95 00:13:35.826 --> 00:13:43.559 huda: handling things under pressure. And like, I think, that was like really stimulating to me. And it like made me more more motivated. 96 00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.000 huda: And then, like the video game like, allowed me to experience that. 97 00:13:49.850 --> 00:14:04.009 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that's like what we want to get out here or like what we want to emphasize like, why are these important? Why are these experiences important to you, and like, what did they bring out in you that you can't necessarily get in real life and like simultaneously? Why is that important? 98 00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:18.769 Jenny Duan: Because I think the challenge here is, we don't want it to make it seem like you can't like you're you're not able to access like courage in your day to day life because you are a courageous person, but rather, we want to see like, how do video games add something unique to your experiences. 99 00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.010 Jenny Duan: so 100 00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.410 Jenny Duan: I think here, this is like, maybe too much elaboration that 101 00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.349 Jenny Duan: think this sentence could be rephrased. 102 00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.250 huda: Hmm. 103 00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.590 Jenny Duan: Like, I think this could be like one set like, I think this paragraph could be like one sentence that, like 104 00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.379 Jenny Duan: emphasizes what we want to bring out here. 105 00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.060 Jenny Duan: that's. 106 00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.680 huda: Can I, or can I do like 2 sentences, and then, like. 107 00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 108 00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.607 huda: Keep this, and then for the second sentence, I can be like 109 00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.900 Jenny Duan: I would delete this. 110 00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:02.549 huda: the the 32 bit adventure, or like the adventure 111 00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.426 huda: or actually the Minecraft character. 112 00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:20.966 huda: was an is an adventurer, just like I am, but with an open world where he or where the character can like battle. Dragons and 113 00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.179 huda: and like. 114 00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:29.150 huda: yeah, battle dragons and like mine for diamonds. And then the 115 00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.696 huda: the the chef hat wearing Papa Louie is like 116 00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:45.289 huda: a stress manager, and like that's what enabled me to be motivated. Something like this, like the second sentence could like, say those things that we talked about about like 117 00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.540 huda: like. Why, those things matter to me. 118 00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:55.080 Jenny Duan: What about this? Like? I learned courage and maybe stress management, or whatever you want you could, you could substitute these adjectives. 119 00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.090 Jenny Duan: I learned courage and balance from my vicarious video game lives. Whether that be blank or blank. 120 00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.159 Jenny Duan: something like that. I feel like that. You can just condense it into one sentence. 121 00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:06.530 huda: Yeah. 122 00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:30.510 Jenny Duan: And you can edit this but like the what we want to emphasize here is like, what are you learning or like? What like we every sentence should like reflect back to you at some way, because you like 650 words. It seems like a lot, but it's really not a lot so like every sentence should be adding, giving detail about you. So in this case it's like, what is this saying about you? Well, you're a courageous person. You're a balanced person, or like you're good at stress management, or whatever you you want to emphasize. It's different for every person. But 123 00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.659 Jenny Duan: you could edit this later. But I think like 124 00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:45.450 Jenny Duan: that's we could condense this down because you you've already written. I don't know how many words this is. Maybe like 4 or 500 words. But you still have to write about Somethoria. So we want to make sure that you have like time to do that, or space to do that. 125 00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.270 Jenny Duan: I think this can be condensed further. But it's fine for now. 126 00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.899 Jenny Duan: actually, this is kind of funny, I think. Keep this. 127 00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:05.109 Jenny Duan: Okay, I love this analogy about math. I think that's a really good analogy. 128 00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:12.000 Jenny Duan: I think you could emphasize like what you've learned in math or what you like about math, or maybe like 129 00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:18.259 Jenny Duan: how that's it's like, why is learning math enforce it? Because you don't really have like? It's not like you're like a math 130 00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.340 Jenny Duan: team member, or you're not like 131 00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:40.090 Jenny Duan: like an Amc. Participant. And like, that's really fine. But like for the Ao, they don't know why you're interested in math like why, math is important to you, and so, if you mention it in your common app, remember, like every single thing in your common app. It should be like a little nugget that they can trace to another part of your application. So they're like, Oh, she likes math, let's look for in her application. But like, if you don't have any like 132 00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:49.519 Jenny Duan: connection to math, you want to emphasize like, why is math important? Besides, the fact that, like you take classes in math, but, like everyone takes classes in math so like, why is math important to you? 133 00:17:50.795 --> 00:17:52.520 huda: I guess I kind of 134 00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.070 huda: like 135 00:17:54.788 --> 00:17:59.731 huda: I guess I could connect it to like my data. Science like background. I guess. 136 00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 137 00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:07.200 huda: Because, like a lot of math is just like like data and like recognizing like patterns. 138 00:18:07.926 --> 00:18:09.180 huda: Yeah, yeah. 139 00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:15.209 Jenny Duan: Okay, that makes sense. And then, if they look for data science, where would they find that in your activities list? Or where would they find that. 140 00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:20.410 huda: They find that in code with classy which is like the data Science Camp. 141 00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.940 Jenny Duan: Anything. Okay? Great. 142 00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.399 Jenny Duan: yeah. So maybe you can make a connection there. So like. 143 00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.260 Jenny Duan: I had that little arrow to classy. Yeah. 144 00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.080 Jenny Duan: And so they know where to find it in the rest of your application. 145 00:18:33.647 --> 00:18:34.810 Jenny Duan: Soon it became. 146 00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.670 huda: Code with Clause C. In this paragraph. 147 00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.369 Jenny Duan: If you want to. Yeah, there's no hard. As long as you can make that connection to data science. 148 00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.229 Jenny Duan: I'm searching for my gladiator 149 00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.949 Jenny Duan: to a manager to a detective faster than you can press, alt tab. 150 00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:01.749 Jenny Duan: But I feel like these 2 set. These 2 sentences could be deleted and go straight here. 151 00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:10.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, speaking differently. How are you speaking differently? I feel like this could be the word could be changed. 152 00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.050 huda: I feel like presenting my 153 00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.329 huda: like presenting my 154 00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.840 huda: like 155 00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.592 huda: like my accomplishments. 156 00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.330 huda: like differently. 157 00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.320 huda: or like presenting myself in general. 158 00:19:31.675 --> 00:19:32.090 huda: Differently. 159 00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.709 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like something like this switching from technical explanations to 160 00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:43.670 Jenny Duan: I don't know passionate advocacy, or you can can change the wording to make it shorter, but like emphasizing how you're speaking at these 2 things. 161 00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.950 huda: Yeah, I like that. 162 00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.019 Jenny Duan: These virtual worlds for training grabs for the real world adaptability I 163 00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.319 Jenny Duan: have developed. 164 00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.240 Jenny Duan: I have developed. 165 00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.460 Jenny Duan: Let's do that. If once you play this. 166 00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.590 Jenny Duan: I would write this 167 00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.060 Jenny Duan: if you just taught me that I can be a programmer and a journalist. 168 00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.259 Jenny Duan: Okay, you're not an interesting technology. 169 00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.510 Jenny Duan: Okay? 170 00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.120 Jenny Duan: I would say this. 171 00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.900 Jenny Duan: where? Okay? So how do you see your writing about centuria fitting in here? 172 00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:39.849 Jenny Duan: Cause I feel like this feels like an ending. So how are you gonna transition from this into more about synthoria or like? Where does synthoria fit in your essay? 173 00:20:40.819 --> 00:21:02.500 huda: I wanted to like transition by talking about like how like this realization of like how I can be all these different facets, can be combined into like one project which is like synthoria. And then and then that's when I was like at a quandary like should I stick with Sina and Yasmeen, who are like tawny 174 00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:20.610 huda: beige skinned characters? Or should I go with something more safe like Amelia and Ava, who are like peach tone characters that people can easily pronounce and like, might be more inclined to play with. And then and then I also wanted to like kind of. 175 00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:41.570 huda: I didn't want to go too in depth. But I wanted to mention, like I had this similar experience in like my biology class when like I wasn't like called on because of like like struggle to pronounce my name. And so I was gonna like, add that little bit of personal experience in there and then. 176 00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:57.500 huda: After that I can like my resolution could be like kind of reflecting on how I came to like this realization that like oh, I can be all these different things. And then I wanted to say something like if I can like step into the shoes of 177 00:21:57.937 --> 00:21:59.609 huda: I don't know. Like 178 00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:15.730 huda: an Italian plumber who's saving a magical princess from a giant like giant turtle. Then someone can surely pronounce Sana and Yasmine, and that shouldn't deflect me. And then and then, yeah, that's kind of like the resolution. 179 00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:35.815 huda: And like concluding everything I can talk about like, how I want Cynthoria to have an impact. So that, like people or like, I guess it has an impact. So that someone out there like playing Synthoria is like living in the identity of Senna and Yasmeen, and that, like me, they're also like gaining all these new 180 00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.640 huda: new like roles to jump from. 181 00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:55.119 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that seems like a lot. So I feel like, let's condense it a little bit. So what are the most important aspects of that. Let's like, 1st isolate those and then figure out how to include that here. 182 00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.570 Jenny Duan: so. And we also want, maybe like. 183 00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:05.569 Jenny Duan: want to include some more crumbs. Actually, I feel like all the links that you've included here are pretty good. 184 00:23:06.312 --> 00:23:08.359 Jenny Duan: Maybe also, some things 185 00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:15.249 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna just write at the bottom, like some things that you also might want to include in this essay. Just like one word mentions. It's like. 186 00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:22.449 Jenny Duan: like writing about games through like the games for change. Competition. 187 00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:29.230 Jenny Duan: if you have space, you could like, include one little phrase where you could like add as such, like a breadcrumb somewhere in your essay, or like 188 00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:29.965 Jenny Duan: the 189 00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:36.215 Jenny Duan: ambassadorship, like limited games, ambassadorship. I feel like that's important here. 190 00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.029 Jenny Duan: You could just like weave that in somehow. 191 00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.310 Jenny Duan: But 192 00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.600 Jenny Duan: to there 193 00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.899 Jenny Duan: creating real world adaptability. I have developed 194 00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.499 Jenny Duan: without compromising the floor. 195 00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:17.729 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel like I'm just right now. I'm visualizing the ending. And I feel like you could write something about like 196 00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.489 Jenny Duan: like the ending. So you're writing all about something where you did not. The ending could be like 197 00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.709 Jenny Duan: the future of video games is 198 00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.409 Jenny Duan: diverse or like. 199 00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:38.749 Jenny Duan: let's use video games as an analogy, for, like the future of the world in your vision, for the world like you could say, like the future of video games is diverse where every player has like the chance to succeed, whatever you see. 200 00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.480 Jenny Duan: And and then you could connect it to like 201 00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.310 Jenny Duan: something about like how 202 00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.999 Jenny Duan: the world, too, can be this way, or like our world, or our human world, too, can be this way. 203 00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.990 Jenny Duan: All you have to do is press play. 204 00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.319 Jenny Duan: That could be the end. 205 00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.750 huda: Oh, I like that. 206 00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:00.089 Jenny Duan: Like, okay, like, I'll just write that down the future of video games. 207 00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:08.469 Jenny Duan: And you don't have to use this exact sentence structure for this. But like you can say, like in the future video games, or like the future of video games, what does that look like 208 00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.700 Jenny Duan: that look like? What does your vision for the world look like 209 00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.539 Jenny Duan: of our world 210 00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.210 Jenny Duan: to can, or like our 211 00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.679 Jenny Duan: human world, or our live world, to get like. 212 00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.830 Jenny Duan: be the same? Or 213 00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.209 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 214 00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.449 Jenny Duan: All you have to do is press play. 215 00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.479 huda: Yeah, I had like, I had like a previous like. 216 00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:45.770 huda: I like wrote it on like the notes app or something. But I was just like thinking like how to conclude it. And then there was one conclusion that I wrote was 217 00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:59.939 huda: in the end. Isn't life the ultimate open world game, where all players, switching between roles, acquiring new skills, facing unexpected challenges. My journey through virtual worlds prepared me for the complexities of my identity and the importance of representation. 218 00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:13.989 huda: As I look to the future, I I see myself continuing to bridge worlds in technology, culture and society, whether it's through game development, creating animated animated websites or crafting content that resonates with other women in tech. 219 00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:19.250 huda: I hope to design experiences where everyone can level up regardless of their starting stats. 220 00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.340 huda: and then this one was just like a. 221 00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.589 Jenny Duan: That's beautifully, Huna. That's so good. Wait! Can you copy, paste that in right now and then? Continue. I don't want to cut off your train of thought. 222 00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:38.119 huda: And then there was just like a bit which was just like to add a little humor. It was game on level up, and may your Wi-fi connection always be strong and your Bopa always perfectly chewy. 223 00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.439 huda: I don't think that's necessary. 224 00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.440 Jenny Duan: I don't think that's necessary, too, but I love the 1st part. 225 00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.260 Jenny Duan: Can you copy paste that in? I think that's really good. 226 00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.080 huda: I just. 227 00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.950 Jenny Duan: Why did you? Why did you write this. 228 00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:04.039 huda: I wrote this like at school. I don't know. I just like I was thinking of like how I wanted. I wanted like, I like writing like powerful, like ending statements. And then I just I thought of that. 229 00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.860 huda: Yeah. 230 00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.689 Jenny Duan: This is really good, so you could edit the ending to be. However you want, but I feel like that's 231 00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:36.720 Jenny Duan: really good. And then I would say. Just try to add one sentence about Somethoria. I don't like not one sentence sorry one. Try to keep your thing about centuria to like just one medium sized paragraph, because I feel like you don't have much room for all else. 232 00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:42.620 Jenny Duan: Let me see how much wording this is like 5 58 words. So you only have, like one big repair. 233 00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.279 huda: Alright! Let me let me apply these edits. 234 00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:14.199 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! You have 200 words left. You have 200 words to write about synthoria. 235 00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.249 Jenny Duan: I feel like, that's a decent yeah. 236 00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:18.580 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 237 00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.040 Jenny Duan: okay. So let's think about how to transition this into syphoria. 238 00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.810 huda: So maybe like. 239 00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.320 huda: I don't know if it's like opening statement might be 240 00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:45.469 huda: too like abstract. But it could be, or like too basic but it could just be like something like this realization 241 00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.879 huda: had made me want to combine all my different. 242 00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.140 huda: I like complexities. 243 00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:58.450 huda: I don't know. I think I actually that doesn't make sense unless they know like what Centhoria is. So 244 00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.420 huda: let me see. 245 00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.970 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can write about like not seeing 246 00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.999 Jenny Duan: yourself represented in games, and then designing your own or 247 00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.159 Jenny Duan: not sure how the best transition here. 248 00:29:29.016 --> 00:29:36.720 huda: Okay? So actually, this last sentence is like, I realized I could explore various facets of myself without compromising my core. 249 00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.000 huda: And like. 250 00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:44.599 huda: I think I can like use instead of having that sentence. Maybe I can like 251 00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:50.129 huda: I, I like the core can be synthoria, because it's like, basically who I am to the floor. 252 00:29:50.170 --> 00:30:01.109 huda: It's like tech, combined with storytelling combined with like Indian combined with Muslim. It's like I am to the core so, and maybe, instead of saying like. 253 00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:08.459 huda: I realized so I could be like, I realized I could explore various facets for myself without compromising my core. 254 00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.860 huda: the game I developed synthoria. 255 00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:21.599 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And and then talking about how Synthoria represents your core? Or what about synthoria? Are you highlighting here? 256 00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.639 huda: Yeah. And then, like the sentence that follows, I can be like, 257 00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.940 huda: I could be like 258 00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.050 huda: with a blend. 259 00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.240 huda: This is just like I'm just like writing stuff down. But like 260 00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.861 huda: with a blend of 261 00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.360 huda: data, science 262 00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.919 huda: mixed with storytelling. Oh. 263 00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.779 huda: and storytelling 264 00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.060 huda: Indian. 265 00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.870 huda: That's good 266 00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.990 huda: characters. 267 00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:14.760 huda: I. I could be like, Okay, I don't know if this like 268 00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.449 huda: this is 269 00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:20.489 huda: far, far fetched, but it could be like I personified 270 00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.779 huda: the game. 271 00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.250 huda: or I personified synthoria. 272 00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds good. 273 00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:37.149 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to repeat centurion twice. 274 00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.739 Jenny Duan: but I'm not sure if this is the smoothest transition 275 00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.369 Jenny Duan: like it still doesn't explain like, why did you develop this game like out of all the games that you wanted to develop? 276 00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.010 Jenny Duan: Why, Sidoria like. 277 00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:02.659 Jenny Duan: why is that? Why was that the idea you chose, instead of just like a fun like wordle thing? 278 00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.130 huda: I'm trying to like. I don't know how to ex like explain it in this way, but like 279 00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:14.170 huda: I think it's just like a combination of like all my different interests, and like 280 00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.000 huda: it's like I mentioned. It's kind of like 281 00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.780 huda: synthoria is kind of like me. 282 00:32:21.428 --> 00:32:23.341 huda: I guess, and then 283 00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.899 huda: like I just I don't know how to put it in this sentence. I think 284 00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.900 huda: I guess I also I also developed it 285 00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:48.969 huda: like, I don't think this like really fits with the theme of the essay. But I also developed it like as an educational tool. Because I don't think I really talk about like being like someone who's interested in education. 286 00:32:49.765 --> 00:32:51.460 huda: Throughout the essay. 287 00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.830 huda: So I don't know if that really relates. But. 288 00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.450 Jenny Duan: Okay. How would you Re, weave that in? 289 00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.020 Jenny Duan: Tell me more about what that looks like? 290 00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.949 huda: like, for example. 291 00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.680 huda: playing like 292 00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:15.578 huda: like to weave it in like, maybe like when I'm talking about like finding a dragon. 293 00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.440 Jenny Duan: Right. 294 00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:23.289 huda: My older sister and then like, I don't know if this is too simple of a example. But 295 00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.119 huda: like I'd I'd help her like 296 00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.930 huda: catch on to like the mechanics and like I'd guide her throughout the 297 00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.299 huda: like action. 298 00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:39.120 Jenny Duan: Okay? I feel like that. Seems like a bit of a departure from the rest of the essay. 299 00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.540 Jenny Duan: I agree. 300 00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.359 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 301 00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.579 Jenny Duan: they can be Indian by barricades. 302 00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, maybe we could transition this with like. 303 00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.610 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is too impersonal, but like a statistic like. 304 00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.260 Jenny Duan: let's see oops. 305 00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.209 Jenny Duan: let me look up like video game. 306 00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.900 Jenny Duan: What percentage of video game characters are white or something. 307 00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.810 Jenny Duan: But we could start there. 308 00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:23.460 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 309 00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.719 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Say. 310 00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.409 Jenny Duan: say 311 00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.829 Jenny Duan: yet, as I found you could say something like, yet, as I 312 00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:37.130 Jenny Duan: as I like found my identity through playing video games. 313 00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.729 Jenny Duan: I realized that like. 314 00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.409 Jenny Duan: I don't know you could. Then you could talk about like 315 00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.370 Jenny Duan: yet like 316 00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:50.750 Jenny Duan: you could say, like, I found you could talk about how you found your duty through video games. Yet 317 00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.269 Jenny Duan: 60% of video gay characters are white. Yet 318 00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.850 Jenny Duan: all this has happened like yet there's still so much 319 00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.790 Jenny Duan: right. And then, like. 320 00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.029 Jenny Duan: How do you fix that? etc? 321 00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.470 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that makes sense. 322 00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:18.270 huda: No, I think it definitely does. And then also, I think a bigger statistic is that 79.2% of lead characters are male. 323 00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.550 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, you could say that too, totally. 324 00:35:32.167 --> 00:35:39.819 huda: Actually, no, I think I think the race might be like a little more important to tap on this one, because. 325 00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.570 Jenny Duan: Both you could say like, yet 326 00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.960 Jenny Duan: this our white and this you know. 327 00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:00.870 huda: Let me see. Like, if there's any 328 00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.150 huda: on 329 00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.480 huda: statistics about South Asian. 330 00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.889 huda: okay, I can't find any 331 00:36:46.692 --> 00:36:55.170 huda: statistics about how many South like what the percentage of like South Asian characters are. But I think if I could find that I think that might be stronger. But. 332 00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.560 Jenny Duan: Okay. 333 00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.089 Jenny Duan: I mean, if you can't find it like 334 00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.620 Jenny Duan: that tells you something too right like. 335 00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.740 Jenny Duan: if you can't find it, then it's like, Oh, well, like. 336 00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.430 huda: Yeah, that's right. 337 00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:11.299 Jenny Duan: So not good. Right? That means that there's maybe like too little representation that they don't even track it, which is 338 00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.069 Jenny Duan: like, that's bad, too, you know. 339 00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:13.930 huda: Yeah. 340 00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:14.730 Jenny Duan: Oh. 341 00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.520 Jenny Duan: yeah, no. Information also tells you some information. 342 00:37:23.887 --> 00:37:43.530 huda: Okay. So video games taught me that I can be a programmer and a journalist. I can be Indian and Muslim and I can be immigrant and American. I found my complex identity through video games. Yet 79.2% of video game characters are male. Yet 54.2% of video game protagonists are white. 343 00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:06.750 huda: my, okay, wait. I don't know if this is too much of a stretch, but it could be something like my identity was made up of video games. But video games weren't made up of my identity. 344 00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:15.469 Jenny Duan: I think that's great. I think we might like change the wording a little bit. But like, Let's, that's let's start with that. That looks good. 345 00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:37.640 Jenny Duan: Okay. This, I think, could all be consolidated to like one sentence. 346 00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.969 Jenny Duan: But it's fine for now 347 00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.130 Jenny Duan: let's see. 348 00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.559 huda: I just do. 349 00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.677 Jenny Duan: That? How's that? 350 00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.050 huda: Yeah. 351 00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.660 huda: Oh, okay, yeah. I like that. 352 00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.609 huda: yeah, I think that blends it like perfectly. 353 00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.860 Jenny Duan: I developed ziptoria with 354 00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.760 Jenny Duan: substitution. 355 00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.401 Jenny Duan: with the best of video game 356 00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.770 Jenny Duan: with my favorite 357 00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.939 Jenny Duan: aspects of video. Or 358 00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:48.179 Jenny Duan: I don't want to stretch this too much. I think you should just write this next pair like you should just write this paragraph about like, why, you've developed syphoria and like what you've learned or like what? How? You've grown since that process 359 00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.300 Jenny Duan: that would be good 360 00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.170 Jenny Duan: and you have like about, yeah, go ahead. 361 00:39:55.510 --> 00:40:03.140 huda: Sorry. Should I still do the story with like wanting to like, change the characters, names, and then like overcoming that. 362 00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:08.339 Jenny Duan: I I, personally wouldn't write that. Because I feel like you have 363 00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.979 Jenny Duan: not. You have like such limited word, count. So it might be better to focus on other aspects such as like 364 00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.160 Jenny Duan: the impact of the game or your learning development through the game. Because. 365 00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.840 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that it's fine to. Don't write about that for now. 366 00:40:23.702 --> 00:40:25.109 huda: Okay, that sounds good. 367 00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:37.560 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like this essay is in really good shape. So we'll just talk about it during our next meeting. But I want to spend some time going over your Stanford supplements. Now, that's okay. If we could transition to that, yeah. 368 00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.260 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. I have that open 369 00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:50.800 Jenny Duan: So this is all about synthoria. 370 00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.250 Jenny Duan: because 371 00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:54.910 Jenny Duan: so 372 00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.109 Jenny Duan: my now primary concern is. 373 00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.239 Jenny Duan: does this overlap too much with your 374 00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.520 Jenny Duan: call? That statement. 375 00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.310 huda: Yeah, I feel like 376 00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:18.849 huda: it definitely has some similarities. And that's all kind of concerned about because, well, this one, okay, they kind of like different topics like gamified education and like finding different identities through video games. 377 00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.650 huda: But I feel like 378 00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:26.319 huda: I don't know if they get a lot of like video game essays. So like, maybe they might just like. 379 00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.950 huda: think that like my only personality, trait is video games. 380 00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.865 Jenny Duan: Okay. 381 00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.340 Jenny Duan: let's see. 382 00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:52.230 Jenny Duan: Oh, oh. 383 00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:59.270 Jenny Duan: so this should be like something about like what you hope to study. 384 00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:03.179 Jenny Duan: And at synrod. Are you applying to the Sts. Major? 385 00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.120 huda: Yeah. 386 00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.369 Jenny Duan: Okay, what specific concentration with an Sts over time. 387 00:42:09.492 --> 00:42:11.479 huda: Communications and media. 388 00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:15.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. 389 00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.285 Jenny Duan: up. 390 00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.260 Jenny Duan: let's come back to this essay. 391 00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:22.850 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 392 00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:23.530 huda: Room, also. 393 00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.309 Jenny Duan: Go back to this essay. I feel like I might need to think about this. Go ahead. 394 00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:49.280 huda: I, looked into like the courses for the concentration of the communication and media for Sts, and it's like, really focused on data journalism, and so maybe instead of talking about like video game development, I can focus more on like data like my data science background. And then like, how I'm curious about like how 395 00:42:49.280 --> 00:43:09.209 huda: data can tell stories. I feel like a lot of people might be saying that already, with like, people are trying to get into like the data science at, like the Cs like aspect. But if I'm like able to kind of show, focus more on like the storytelling part. Maybe that could be like a better use of like this essay. 396 00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:24.449 Jenny Duan: I agree. I also like love this essay. So I don't want you to abandon it entirely. I'm thinking maybe we could use this for University of California, like I feel like since there is. How long are their essays? I'm sorry. Let me check. I don't remember. 397 00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.210 Jenny Duan: Hello! Hello! 398 00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.690 huda: 3. 50. Words. 399 00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:32.539 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's just repurpose this and stick it into the Ucsas. 400 00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.760 Jenny Duan: I cause I love this essay. It's like a great essay. I think it deserves its light. But 401 00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:42.620 Jenny Duan: maybe not for Stanford, since they already have your common app, which is like pretty similar. 402 00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.960 Jenny Duan: So okay. 403 00:43:45.510 --> 00:44:02.479 Jenny Duan: then, we can adjust this to Uc, so can you just save this in like another document, or just whatever just retain a copy of it. And I think writing an essay about data journalism would be probably more related to your major. And then it wouldn't be as repetitive because your comment up is already so much about games. 404 00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.060 Jenny Duan: But this essay won't get wasted. It'll just be used for something else, which is fine. 405 00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:13.140 huda: Okay, yeah. I just saved in a different document. 406 00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.670 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 407 00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.290 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I think, here. 408 00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.679 Jenny Duan: I feel like. 409 00:44:23.734 --> 00:44:27.255 Jenny Duan: I love this about Syrians. 410 00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.589 Jenny Duan: okay, this is great. This is only 2 50 words. Right? 411 00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.680 huda: Yeah. 412 00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:46.370 Jenny Duan: Okay? 413 00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:04.430 Jenny Duan: Great. 414 00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:13.280 Jenny Duan: Okay? Instead of calculus cram sessions. Let's change this into something that's like slightly more positive. 415 00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:24.950 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like X rabbit holes back home, or like Wikipedia, deep dives, or something that emphasizes your curiosity rather than just a focus on like getting good grades or cramming for an exam. 416 00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:33.489 huda: I was I was thinking of like doing cause my like calculus cram sessions were usually times where, like I listened like jazz in the background. 417 00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.700 Jenny Duan: Oh! 418 00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:39.489 huda: I like thought of that. But I think, yeah, it could definitely be something different. Like. 419 00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.809 huda: like, my. 420 00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.640 huda: maybe like 421 00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:54.099 huda: algorithm, like algorithm, like form diving like like on Reddit, like the 422 00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.340 huda: I guess, like. 423 00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.600 huda: yeah. 424 00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.060 huda: So maybe instead, I could put like. 425 00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:25.920 huda: Oh. 426 00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. 427 00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.120 huda: And also I don't know if this seems like an information dump 428 00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.390 huda: like right here. 429 00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:46.900 Jenny Duan: I don't think so. 430 00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:47.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. 431 00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:58.019 Jenny Duan: oh, yeah. Another thing that there might be a lot of repetition is your like moment in history is also about able data, lovely. So I would. 432 00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.120 huda: This Hopper. 433 00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.469 Jenny Duan: Oh, Grace Hopper, sorry. 434 00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.930 Jenny Duan: Let me just check it one more time. 435 00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.663 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, sorry. It's not about it's not. It's not about 436 00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.349 Jenny Duan: okay. I feel like. 437 00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:18.900 Jenny Duan: but I feel like Anna Lovelace and Grace Hopper are like 2 438 00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:29.250 Jenny Duan: influential leaders, but it's also a bit cliche, not a bit cliche, but like, they're the 1st people people like, they're the 1st terms. If you like, Google, like famous woman in computer science like, you'll get their names. 439 00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.659 Jenny Duan: So maybe it'd be better to do something that's like slightly more 440 00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:36.930 Jenny Duan: niche, or something that like slightly more unique. For the second essay. 441 00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:47.369 Jenny Duan: like the one about the historical moment, because I feel like anyone who's interested any woman. It's yes, could write about Grace Hopper like that doesn't add anything to about your story. 442 00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.940 huda: Hmm. 443 00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:02.474 Jenny Duan: But I don't like. What are your thoughts? Feel free to push back. 444 00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:05.470 huda: I mean, like. 445 00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:32.499 huda: I'm sure. Yeah, I think like I was also thinking might be a little too cliche, because there's I feel like a lot of like women in tech are like interested in like, especially Ada Lovelace and like, I don't know about Grace Hopper. I wasn't aware that she's like, really popular. But yeah, I think I could if I could find something that's more specific to like what I'm doing. So at Stanford. That would be like data journalism. Let me see if I could find any like 446 00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.809 huda: Dana journalists back in the day that were like. 447 00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.160 huda: Okay, so 448 00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:22.270 huda: I don't see like specifically like historic, like, what like, what do we define as historical in this like? Does it have to be like 449 00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.819 huda: like 100 years ago, or like. 450 00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:29.730 huda: Could it be something that happened like in the sixties or seventies. 451 00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:41.409 Jenny Duan: I feel like something that could have happened. It could be as historical as you want. 452 00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:50.250 huda: cause I, it looks like data journalists, mainly like, started in. 453 00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.590 Jenny Duan: It doesn't have to be data journalism. It could also be anything else. 454 00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.839 huda: Like, would it have to be technology related. 455 00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.560 Jenny Duan: No, not necessarily. 456 00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.640 huda: Hmm! 457 00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.720 huda: And I'm not really sure like 458 00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.419 huda: what? Specifically, I'd be looking for. 459 00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.930 Jenny Duan: Like. Let's see what other things about your profile. Have you not yet emphasized. 460 00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.459 huda: I don't believe I've talked about 461 00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:32.610 huda: journalism at all. Actually, I think I talked a little bit in my like 462 00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.919 huda: this and like y U.S.A, for like the 463 00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:40.450 huda: like, the contributions essay 464 00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:45.090 huda: so 465 00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.293 huda: I don't think I talked about teaching 466 00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.079 huda: and like both. 467 00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.720 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that could be good. 468 00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.099 Jenny Duan: Maybe like a famous lecture by, like. 469 00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:20.320 Jenny Duan: I don't like, yeah, just like a famous lecture that 470 00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.559 Jenny Duan: you're curious, though. 471 00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:32.779 huda: Maybe, like the first, st like university was actually like founded by, I think, like I think it was like a Muslim woman. 472 00:51:33.121 --> 00:51:34.679 huda: Let me just double check. 473 00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 474 00:51:54.710 --> 00:52:01.597 huda: Yeah, she was Muslim, American or not American, but like a Muslim woman, and she found the 475 00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.530 huda: She found the 1st university. 476 00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 477 00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.510 huda: That's cool. 478 00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.180 huda: like founding like when she founded that. 479 00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:20.619 huda: Or actually, I'm looking at this. And like, there's different answers online. 480 00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.539 huda: Yeah. But I think this one's like the oldest is like 859. 481 00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.750 huda: this other one was in 1,088. But 482 00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.849 huda: yeah, I think I think it's accurate. 483 00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:43.970 huda: Yep. 484 00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.120 Jenny Duan: Sounds good. 485 00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:58.539 huda: So actually like. 486 00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:47.770 huda: And 487 00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.880 huda: oh, yeah, for for this one. 488 00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:24.060 huda: number 3, like, what aspects of your life experiences, interests and character would you like 489 00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:36.559 huda: would help you make a distinctive contribution? Like, I was wondering how I could approach those changes like how I can like highlight things about like myself rather than just like 490 00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:43.409 huda: cause. I I tried doing it in the stuff, but, like I, I can see like how it's more focused on Stanford than myself. 491 00:54:44.500 --> 00:55:05.849 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that right here this really sticks out like at Stanford. I won't just be the girl in the corner anymore. I'll be. But you don't want to emphasize like how Stanford will change you. You want to emphasize. How are you going to change this institution? And how are you going to make an impact on the institution? And I feel like that's like the fundamental mindset shift that I would like to see here. It's not like. 492 00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:18.590 Jenny Duan: because the roommate essay is more like how Stanford's going to influence you, and how it'll make you a different person. But this essay is is more focused on like, what are you doing to make a difference at Stanford? Does that like mental flip? 493 00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:20.300 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense to you? 494 00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.279 huda: Yeah, I mean, I think I 495 00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:33.033 huda: I think I tried with these like bullet points where I talked about how I'll start like the Cardinal, which is like the Sanford themed World game. 496 00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:40.300 huda: And then I talked about starting like a column in the Stanford daily called overheard of the quad 497 00:55:40.974 --> 00:55:48.090 huda: and then building like bridges between the Muslim Student Union and the South Asian Society Club. 498 00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:50.630 huda: and like 499 00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.890 huda: making spaces where both of these identities can exist. 500 00:55:54.940 --> 00:56:00.309 huda: And then the and then the last bullet point was talked about the Stanford women in computer science. 501 00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:13.585 huda: And then, like showing other quiet girls that they, their voices matter in tech. And then I think I tried conveying like, how I can make like an impact in these clubs and whatnot. But 502 00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:20.260 huda: yeah, I don't know if I'm like, if I can like, focus on myself a little more in this. 503 00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:22.560 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 504 00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.269 Jenny Duan: So okay, let's let's focus. 505 00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.539 Jenny Duan: I feel like we've talked a lot today. So let's 506 00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:35.990 Jenny Duan: like trying to think about this briefly. And then we can continue talking about this the next time we meet, which is on 507 00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:39.130 Jenny Duan: Friday. So 508 00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:50.659 Jenny Duan: what do you think makes you just forget about the essay just like we could just talk. What do you think makes you differentiated as a candidate to state for university? And why should they take you over 509 00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.980 Jenny Duan: all of the girls who are applied for all the Bay Area girls who are applied were 510 00:56:56.010 --> 00:57:00.070 Jenny Duan: all the just applicant pool in general like, why are you 511 00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.520 Jenny Duan: important enough. 512 00:57:03.188 --> 00:57:05.459 huda: I think it's because I've like 513 00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:12.009 huda: a like keen interest in like not just like going to Stanford to like hire my own education. 514 00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:28.369 huda: but like also building like collective platform for other people who also get admitted. So like, for example, like the connections that I'd make at Stanford, like I feel like I want to use those connections to create something bigger. 515 00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:34.150 huda: Just to name an example like like, I explained earlier, like the 516 00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:42.810 huda: like bridging like 2 clubs together, like forming like alliances, so that so that, like. 517 00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:47.179 huda: I don't know, like identities can coexist, and like, I think. 518 00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:53.880 huda: like bringing making, like Stanford, more interconnected. And I think, like the reason why I'm like a good candidate for that 519 00:57:53.930 --> 00:58:00.790 huda: is because, like of my different skills of like, I guess, being like a gentle leader. 520 00:58:01.366 --> 00:58:04.100 huda: also being someone who's like. 521 00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:18.700 huda: kind of more technically skilled in like data, science or technology. And so I can like code these things to help promote like connectivity within Stanford. And yeah, I think those are the things that really set me apart. 522 00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.869 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. I feel like this. Essay needs to be reformatted and rewritten. 523 00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:32.900 Jenny Duan: I think this, like dear Diary format, doesn't lend itself like the gravity that you want in this essay, because this essay is all about like impact. Because. 524 00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:56.929 Jenny Duan: like, I said, like colleges, invest a lot of resources into every student like. Of course, you pay a lot of tuition, sure, but like they also invest a lot into like ensuring that you are a successful alumni that will like lend credibility to Stanford's name in the future. So you need to think about like, what legacy do you want to leave in the future and like, why does that align with Stanford's goals, or Stanford's Mission, or Stanford's 525 00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.430 Jenny Duan: presentation? 526 00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:06.309 Jenny Duan: And I think this essay needs more gravity than like a dear diary format can like naturally lend. 527 00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:12.809 Jenny Duan: I don't know. What are your thoughts on that feel free to disagree, challenge me like I don't know. I'm just putting out ideas. 528 00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:19.150 huda: So I'm just. I'm just wondering like, is it like? Because, like the dear Jerry might be like. 529 00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:29.750 huda: I can be talking like to myself about like how? Why, I can be good for Stanford. But like, if I were to like, do in a different format like and like a normal like standard essay. 530 00:59:30.044 --> 00:59:35.070 huda: I can like see? I don't know. Actually, I don't know if this essay is supposed to be like 531 00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:40.129 huda: more straightforward or like, if I should like take a creative approach to it. 532 00:59:40.524 --> 00:59:45.070 huda: And like I just, I don't know how to make it sound like it's 533 00:59:45.444 --> 00:59:48.689 huda: not just like listing different things I do at Stanford. 534 00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:52.520 huda: Which I guess I kinda do right now. But like. 535 00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.010 huda: yeah, like, I just don't know how to make it more cohesive, I think. 536 00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:02.979 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's just the format of dear Diary doesn't make it feel serious 537 01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:08.870 Jenny Duan: like you wanna increase like the seriousness of this essay like this might be a place where you think like. 538 01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:21.260 Jenny Duan: you know, like talk about the struggles that you've experienced or like what you've had to overcome and like, how's how you're gonna change the world based on your experiences like, what are you gonna take about your experiences and like. 539 01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.870 Jenny Duan: it's basically about how you're going to change the world. 540 01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:36.270 Jenny Duan: if, like, you're gonna change the world. You know that you are but like how and in what ways? And how does this influence, Stanford. Why does Stanford have to be a part of your journey like what resources here can you leverage for your journey, and like? How will you shape 541 01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:40.730 Jenny Duan: the future of Stanford like it's about like, for example. 542 01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:48.300 Jenny Duan: as an AI ethics advocate that you will continue advocating for AI ethics to change the landscape of what technology looks like or like 543 01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.830 Jenny Duan: as a game developer, you're developing like the 544 01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:01.069 Jenny Duan: platforms of tomorrow or like, what are you doing? That's like so impactful that, like you have to be here. And why do they need you there, too? 545 01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:03.499 Jenny Duan: And here it's also a good place to emphasize, like 546 01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:09.929 Jenny Duan: maybe any struggles that you've experienced in your journey, because this is like where you could get some brownie points, for, like. 547 01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:15.140 Jenny Duan: you know, you have, like experience struggling to talk about like financial insecurity could talk about like 548 01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:27.079 Jenny Duan: Co. Like, I think Raj said, that sorry your dad said that like now you qualify for food assistance like that's like something that I would put here, because, like Stanford, very much cares about like 549 01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:47.920 Jenny Duan: overcoming adversity. And like, that's something that you want to like highlight, because that's 1 thing that's unique. It sets your profile part. This is the part where, remember all the essays that you wrote about coming from Mountain house, and like this, like small town like, make it like, you know, like all of that, I think should come out in this essay, because, like those, are all really important parts of your story that I feel like you haven't written about yet. 550 01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:48.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 551 01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.899 huda: I agree, I think. Yeah. Then I'll write a different like, draft of this. I think I'll try and like. 552 01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:01.170 huda: like, I'll kind of like maintain some of these ideas like, I think I still think. 553 01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:02.490 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Totally. 554 01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:05.399 huda: The wordle idea. I don't know if that's like 555 01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:11.450 huda: I feel like, that's just an idea that I really want to contribute to Stanford. And I'm really excited to like 556 01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:21.739 huda: opportunity to like, contribute that. So I think that's something that I'll continue writing about. But I think, yeah, like bringing in like different, like adversities. Maybe I think. 557 01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:29.019 huda: like you said that could probably like give me like Brownie points, or like, tell people more about like things that I didn't mention already. 558 01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:44.260 Jenny Duan: Exactly yeah, like instead of like, I would say, overheard of the quad is something that like, would this would go more into a roommate essay for this I would write something like, Don't write this exactly because I I don't. I think this is a bit cliche, but like it's more along the lines of like 559 01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:47.069 Jenny Duan: you want to use your voice as a beacon 560 01:02:47.200 --> 01:03:00.040 Jenny Duan: truth, just like how you do in folklift, like continuing your mission of folklift like highlighting small businesses to the world, or advancing economic opportunity for those experiencing with the most adversity during the pandemic, or like something like that where it just sounds like a bit more like. 561 01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:04.160 Jenny Duan: I don't know if you understand what I mean by like that tone change. 562 01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.200 huda: Yeah, like that. 563 01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.890 Jenny Duan: What's the difference between this essay and like the ruby essay. 564 01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:10.050 huda: Hmm, okay. I see. 565 01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:24.510 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. I feel like this is a good stopping point. We've talked a lot. I'll send a recap email with some notes. But do you feel prepared to meet on Friday again? With these changes in mind, both in your common app and a couple of these essays. 566 01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:32.159 huda: Yeah, I think I think that's enough times like for me to update. And then I I think on Friday we're working on the Usc supplementals. 567 01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:32.760 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 568 01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.319 Jenny Duan: So let's talk about that. Let's let's start with the Usc. And then. 569 01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:40.509 Jenny Duan: so you haven't written anything yet, right? Or have you. 570 01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:50.010 huda: I've written just like some like ideas that I had for some of them. But they're just like not for like the like, the 2 50 word ones just for, like the short answers. 571 01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.930 Jenny Duan: Okay, so let's start with those. And then. 572 01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:57.609 Jenny Duan: once we're done, or if we have time, we can come back to these Stanford settlements. 573 01:03:57.970 --> 01:03:59.560 huda: Okay. Sounds good. 574 01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:04.919 Jenny Duan: Cool. See you, Friday, and let me know if you have anything before, then feel free to text me, or like, send documents my way. 575 01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:07.300 huda: Okay, thank you. 576 01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:07.960 Jenny Duan: Bye.",

Okay, I'm just gonna write some small notes. These are things that I want you to just ignore for now. But I'm just writing down so I can remember later. But these are like small details. 8 00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.320 Jenny Duan: okay. 9 00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.020 Jenny Duan: actually, not gonna delete anything I'll just suggest.

Don't do anything with them until you're done writing the essay. 11 00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.850 Jenny Duan: See? 12 00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.800 Jenny Duan: Shit. 13 00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.240 Jenny Duan: I've these. I'm gonna talk through these comments, but I'm just gonna read through it and like, write everything down before I start talking. 14 00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.899 Jenny Duan: Okay, I love this. I feel like this is much better than your earlier drafts. What do you think. 15 00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:13.920 huda: Yeah, I think. I think I definitely am able to show my personality a little bit better here. And then also, like I wanted to continue it by talking about like developing synthoria. So I think, like there's 2 kin",
    "d of aspects of growth that I can show here like for one. I can show like, how 16 00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.259 huda: I used to like play video games and think that like 17 00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:31.360 huda: and before, like my identity, I could only play one game. I could only be one thing, but then, like video games taught me that I can like be different things. And then I also applied that to in your life. So that's 1 factor of my growth, and then another. 18 00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.900 Jenny Duan: All right. 19 00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:43.269 huda: Can be applied like when I'm talking about synthoria and like how I decided I wanted to like go for like Muslim Indian characters, because, like, that's like. 20 00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:51.210 huda: I guess, a way of spreading different or like, I guess, spreading like the prominence of my identity. And like. 21 00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.900 huda: yeah, I guess I can't really articulate it, but I think that's like the second aspect of growth. So I think 22 00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.239 huda: this one's a really good for 23 00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.970 huda: showing my growth in comparison to the other ones that I did. 24 00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.230 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I really like this, I think that one thing that we might want to approach when 25 00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.430 Jenny Duan: considering, like all of your essays in context is. 26 00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:31.500 Jenny Duan: I wanna see, because I know that you write about a lot. So I don't want it to feel like too repetitive with your with video games as a theme for showing in other essays. I don't think that that's the case with your 1st Stanford supplemental, but that's just like one thing that we should keep in mind to just not make it too repetitive about video games. Because 27 00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.160 Jenny Duan: I think you, you write a lot about video games and like not that it's too repetitive right now, but like. 28 00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39",
    ".793 Jenny Duan: I think that's something that we should consider. 29 00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.639 huda: Was something that I was like a bit concerned about because for, like the Sanford like for the 1st supplemental. 30 00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:56.570 huda: it's about like something that I'm curious on, and it's about like gamified education. And then I guess in the beginning I kind of brush upon that about like how video games can like 31 00:06:56.973 --> 00:07:07.000 huda: help educate. So I don't want it to like like you said like sound the same, or be repetitive. But like, yeah, I don't know how to frame it differently. Then. 32 00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:15.930 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like, this is a good, I think. Let's just. The common app is the most important essay. So I feel like this is 33 00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.640 Jenny Duan: good so far. So let's go like line by line, and 34 00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.940 Jenny Duan: talk about some of the 35 00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.390 Jenny Duan: details that I wrote down. So this is great. 36 00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.829 Jenny Duan: The next hour you're managing a pizza franchise generating 37 00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.230 Jenny Duan: yeah. 38 00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:48.819 Jenny Duan: Some figure income at 7 years old, maybe. Say something like make an allusion to entrepreneurship like a budding young entrepreneur don't like maybe not this exact mind, but like something like that. Add how you're like 39 00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.009 Jenny Duan: emphasizing that you're entrepreneurial because I feel like that's a good quality to emphasize. 40 00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.490 Jenny Duan: I love this subtots. 41 00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:09.000 Jenny Duan: hey! Since you say that you write 7 twice, you could maybe delete it in one of these 2 places. I would maybe delete it here, and just 42 00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.759 Jenny Duan: keep the sentence. 43 00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:18.609 huda: Yeah. Wait. What if I wrote like a",
    "fter the generating a 7 figure income? 44 00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:24.009 huda: And I could be like Mark Cuban has nothing on me, or like something like that. 45 00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.950 huda: How about. 46 00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:30.380 Jenny Duan: I don't think I would write that because I don't think you should make an allusion to any specific people 47 00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.800 Jenny Duan: there. 48 00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.070 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 49 00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.389 Jenny Duan: I live Vicussey through 50 00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.720 Jenny Duan: video games. 51 00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.420 Jenny Duan: So now you're going from like the past to the present tense. 52 00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.990 Jenny Duan: Is it true that you live vicariously through video games? Or I, I might consider rephrasing this to another phrase. 53 00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.599 Jenny Duan: because I don't feel like it's like that you live vicariously through video games. I think it's something different. 54 00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:06.250 Jenny Duan: Would you agree or disagree? I'm not sure. How would you describe your experience with video games? 55 00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:17.600 huda: Well, I think like the point of the essay is about like how I like I live like when I play like Minecraft. I feel like adventurous 56 00:09:18.012 --> 00:09:28.950 huda: and then, when I when I like play, probably, for example, I can like feel like an entrepreneur, and that's like I guess that was like the point of 57 00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.909 huda: like playing these games. Is that like, I got to experience these different 58 00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:41.749 huda: I guess lives. And so that's kind of like the way I worded it that I live vicariously through them. 59 00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.169 huda: I don't know if it like works in this specific sentence, but I feel like 60 00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.610 huda: like in general. I think I'd say that I do live vicariously through video gam",
    "e characters. 61 00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:59.290 huda: Maybe and I also wanted to touch upon that when I'm talking about synthloria, because there could be people like 62 00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.259 huda: vicariously living through like San and Yaski. 63 00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.630 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could say, like. 64 00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.220 Jenny Duan: through video games. 65 00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.490 Jenny Duan: I experience like, Is there a warp 66 00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:32.949 Jenny Duan: not positive, but like maybe a more educational spin we could do on this like, maybe, like through video games, I 67 00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:42.049 Jenny Duan: live out my different lives as a blank or as blank and like maybe instead of Minecraft. You could use other like 68 00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.579 Jenny Duan: or relevant allergies 69 00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.890 Jenny Duan: or 70 00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.120 Jenny Duan: cause. I feel like living vicariously through video games seems like 71 00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.400 Jenny Duan: a bit of a negative connotation. 72 00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:53.850 huda: Oh, 73 00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.270 huda: In that case, maybe 74 00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.090 huda: Maybe you could like. 75 00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:14.469 huda: you know how people put like different hats on, for, like the different like personalities and things. I think, like, maybe I can maybe like refer to video games as like the different hats. And I can like, maybe, like, put on my 76 00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:24.293 huda: like desk receptionist hat, where I'm like throwing like like paper into the trash, or like I can put on my 77 00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.360 huda: like 78 00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.069 huda: like, for example. 79 00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:43.809 huda: an adventure spirit from like the game like and or like an explorer in Zelda. And like, maybe, like my video, the video games. I don't know if this like has too many analogies, because I ",
    "know we already have, like the game analogy happening 80 00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:53.220 huda: or like reference happening. But like, yeah, I could like maybe talk about like the games being like my different hats, and like putting on like different identities. 81 00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.210 Jenny Duan: Okay, 82 00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.470 Jenny Duan: let's see. 83 00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.199 Jenny Duan: maybe like, Oh, yeah, I think, like. 84 00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:28.189 Jenny Duan: basically, what I think is like for this question, living vicariously implies that there's like something about this life in the video game that you don't already have in your life, or that's missing from your life like you live vicariously through someone else because you can't gain that experience for yourself. So what about these video games? Do you want to emphasize for yourself, or like? What can't you experience in your own life that you have to seek out in the video game. I think that's what I'm trying to get at here. 85 00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.347 huda: Oh, yeah, I think just like 86 00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:38.329 huda: especially as like when I was, I played these games like when I was younger. So I think there's like lots of boundaries like, for example. 87 00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.370 huda: like taking from, like some of the past essays that we read last meeting. 88 00:12:43.852 --> 00:12:54.189 huda: like maybe credibility or age and like, for example, I can't go and slay a dragon but like in the in the game, I can. 89 00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.790 huda: or like I could have like a pizza business, but I can't like I can in the game. 90 00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.119 Jenny Duan: Okay, wait. Why can't you have a pizza pistos? And why is that important to you? 91 00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.570 huda: Because I think. 92 00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:14.499 huda: okay, well, I like, one thing is that I was like, I've kind of been like adventurous when I was younger like. Okay. 93 0",
    "0:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.683 huda: relating to the Minecraft example that like. 94 00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:35.340 huda: I've been adventurous. But just like I never got these experiences like, obviously, I can't say dragon, but like, and also like opening a pizza shop would, was important to me, because, like, I got the experience of, you know, dealing with customers, and like 95 00:13:35.826 --> 00:13:43.559 huda: handling things under pressure. And like, I think, that was like really stimulating to me. And it like made me more more motivated. 96 00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.000 huda: And then, like the video game like, allowed me to experience that. 97 00:13:49.850 --> 00:14:04.009 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that's like what we want to get out here or like what we want to emphasize like, why are these important? Why are these experiences important to you, and like, what did they bring out in you that you can't necessarily get in real life and like simultaneously? Why is that important? 98 00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:18.769 Jenny Duan: Because I think the challenge here is, we don't want it to make it seem like you can't like you're you're not able to access like courage in your day to day life because you are a courageous person, but rather, we want to see like, how do video games add something unique to your experiences. 99 00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.010 Jenny Duan: so 100 00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.410 Jenny Duan: I think here, this is like, maybe too much elaboration that 101 00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.349 Jenny Duan: think this sentence could be rephrased. 102 00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.250 huda: Hmm. 103 00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.590 Jenny Duan: Like, I think this could be like one set like, I think this paragraph could be like one sentence that, like 104 00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.379 Jenny Duan: emphasizes what we want to bring out here. 105 00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.060 Jenny Duan: that's. 106 00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.680 huda: Can I, or can I do like 2 sentences, and t",
    "hen, like. 107 00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 108 00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.607 huda: Keep this, and then for the second sentence, I can be like 109 00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.900 Jenny Duan: I would delete this. 110 00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:02.549 huda: the the 32 bit adventure, or like the adventure 111 00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.426 huda: or actually the Minecraft character. 112 00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:20.966 huda: was an is an adventurer, just like I am, but with an open world where he or where the character can like battle. Dragons and 113 00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.179 huda: and like. 114 00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:29.150 huda: yeah, battle dragons and like mine for diamonds. And then the 115 00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.696 huda: the the chef hat wearing Papa Louie is like 116 00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:45.289 huda: a stress manager, and like that's what enabled me to be motivated. Something like this, like the second sentence could like, say those things that we talked about about like 117 00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.540 huda: like. Why, those things matter to me. 118 00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:55.080 Jenny Duan: What about this? Like? I learned courage and maybe stress management, or whatever you want you could, you could substitute these adjectives. 119 00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.090 Jenny Duan: I learned courage and balance from my vicarious video game lives. Whether that be blank or blank. 120 00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.159 Jenny Duan: something like that. I feel like that. You can just condense it into one sentence. 121 00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:06.530 huda: Yeah. 122 00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:30.510 Jenny Duan: And you can edit this but like the what we want to emphasize here is like, what are you learning or like? What like we every sentence should like reflect back to you at some way, because you like 650 words. It seems like a lot, but it's really not a lot so like every sentence should be adding, giving detail about you. So in this case it's like, what is this s",
    "aying about you? Well, you're a courageous person. You're a balanced person, or like you're good at stress management, or whatever you you want to emphasize. It's different for every person. But 123 00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.659 Jenny Duan: you could edit this later. But I think like 124 00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:45.450 Jenny Duan: that's we could condense this down because you you've already written. I don't know how many words this is. Maybe like 4 or 500 words. But you still have to write about Somethoria. So we want to make sure that you have like time to do that, or space to do that. 125 00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.270 Jenny Duan: I think this can be condensed further. But it's fine for now. 126 00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.899 Jenny Duan: actually, this is kind of funny, I think. Keep this. 127 00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:05.109 Jenny Duan: Okay, I love this analogy about math. I think that's a really good analogy. 128 00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:12.000 Jenny Duan: I think you could emphasize like what you've learned in math or what you like about math, or maybe like 129 00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:18.259 Jenny Duan: how that's it's like, why is learning math enforce it? Because you don't really have like? It's not like you're like a math 130 00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.340 Jenny Duan: team member, or you're not like 131 00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:40.090 Jenny Duan: like an Amc. Participant. And like, that's really fine. But like for the Ao, they don't know why you're interested in math like why, math is important to you, and so, if you mention it in your common app, remember, like every single thing in your common app. It should be like a little nugget that they can trace to another part of your application. So they're like, Oh, she likes math, let's look for in her application. But like, if you don't have any like 132 00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:49.519 Jenny Duan: connection to math, you want to emphasize like, why is math important? Besides, the fact that, like you take classes in math, but",
    ", like everyone takes classes in math so like, why is math important to you? 133 00:17:50.795 --> 00:17:52.520 huda: I guess I kind of 134 00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.070 huda: like 135 00:17:54.788 --> 00:17:59.731 huda: I guess I could connect it to like my data. Science like background. I guess. 136 00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 137 00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:07.200 huda: Because, like a lot of math is just like like data and like recognizing like patterns. 138 00:18:07.926 --> 00:18:09.180 huda: Yeah, yeah. 139 00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:15.209 Jenny Duan: Okay, that makes sense. And then, if they look for data science, where would they find that in your activities list? Or where would they find that. 140 00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:20.410 huda: They find that in code with classy which is like the data Science Camp. 141 00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.940 Jenny Duan: Anything. Okay? Great. 142 00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.399 Jenny Duan: yeah. So maybe you can make a connection there. So like. 143 00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.260 Jenny Duan: I had that little arrow to classy. Yeah. 144 00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.080 Jenny Duan: And so they know where to find it in the rest of your application. 145 00:18:33.647 --> 00:18:34.810 Jenny Duan: Soon it became. 146 00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.670 huda: Code with Clause C. In this paragraph. 147 00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.369 Jenny Duan: If you want to. Yeah, there's no hard. As long as you can make that connection to data science. 148 00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.229 Jenny Duan: I'm searching for my gladiator 149 00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.949 Jenny Duan: to a manager to a detective faster than you can press, alt tab. 150 00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:01.749 Jenny Duan: But I feel like these 2 set. These 2 sentences could be deleted and go straight here. 151 00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:10.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, speaking differently. How are you speaking differently? I feel like this could be the word could be changed. 152 00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.",
    "050 huda: I feel like presenting my 153 00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.329 huda: like presenting my 154 00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.840 huda: like 155 00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.592 huda: like my accomplishments. 156 00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.330 huda: like differently. 157 00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.320 huda: or like presenting myself in general. 158 00:19:31.675 --> 00:19:32.090 huda: Differently. 159 00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.709 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like something like this switching from technical explanations to 160 00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:43.670 Jenny Duan: I don't know passionate advocacy, or you can can change the wording to make it shorter, but like emphasizing how you're speaking at these 2 things. 161 00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.950 huda: Yeah, I like that. 162 00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.019 Jenny Duan: These virtual worlds for training grabs for the real world adaptability I 163 00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.319 Jenny Duan: have developed. 164 00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.240 Jenny Duan: I have developed. 165 00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.460 Jenny Duan: Let's do that. If once you play this. 166 00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.590 Jenny Duan: I would write this 167 00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.060 Jenny Duan: if you just taught me that I can be a programmer and a journalist. 168 00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.259 Jenny Duan: Okay, you're not an interesting technology. 169 00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.510 Jenny Duan: Okay? 170 00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.120 Jenny Duan: I would say this. 171 00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.900 Jenny Duan: where? Okay? So how do you see your writing about centuria fitting in here? 172 00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:39.849 Jenny Duan: Cause I feel like this feels like an ending. So how are you gonna transition from this into more about synthoria or like? Where does synthoria fit in your essay? 173 00:20:40.819 --> 00:21:02.500 huda: I wanted to like transition by talking about like how like this realization of like how I can be all these different facets, can be combined into like",
    " one project which is like synthoria. And then and then that's when I was like at a quandary like should I stick with Sina and Yasmeen, who are like tawny 174 00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:20.610 huda: beige skinned characters? Or should I go with something more safe like Amelia and Ava, who are like peach tone characters that people can easily pronounce and like, might be more inclined to play with. And then and then I also wanted to like kind of. 175 00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:41.570 huda: I didn't want to go too in depth. But I wanted to mention, like I had this similar experience in like my biology class when like I wasn't like called on because of like like struggle to pronounce my name. And so I was gonna like, add that little bit of personal experience in there and then. 176 00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:57.500 huda: After that I can like my resolution could be like kind of reflecting on how I came to like this realization that like oh, I can be all these different things. And then I wanted to say something like if I can like step into the shoes of 177 00:21:57.937 --> 00:21:59.609 huda: I don't know. Like 178 00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:15.730 huda: an Italian plumber who's saving a magical princess from a giant like giant turtle. Then someone can surely pronounce Sana and Yasmine, and that shouldn't deflect me. And then and then, yeah, that's kind of like the resolution. 179 00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:35.815 huda: And like concluding everything I can talk about like, how I want Cynthoria to have an impact. So that, like people or like, I guess it has an impact. So that someone out there like playing Synthoria is like living in the identity of Senna and Yasmeen, and that, like me, they're also like gaining all these new 180 00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.640 huda: new like roles to jump from. 181 00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:55.119 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that seems like a lot. So I feel like, let's condense it a little bit. So what are the most important aspects of that. Let's like, 1st isolate t",
    "hose and then figure out how to include that here. 182 00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.570 Jenny Duan: so. And we also want, maybe like. 183 00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:05.569 Jenny Duan: want to include some more crumbs. Actually, I feel like all the links that you've included here are pretty good. 184 00:23:06.312 --> 00:23:08.359 Jenny Duan: Maybe also, some things 185 00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:15.249 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna just write at the bottom, like some things that you also might want to include in this essay. Just like one word mentions. It's like. 186 00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:22.449 Jenny Duan: like writing about games through like the games for change. Competition. 187 00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:29.230 Jenny Duan: if you have space, you could like, include one little phrase where you could like add as such, like a breadcrumb somewhere in your essay, or like 188 00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:29.965 Jenny Duan: the 189 00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:36.215 Jenny Duan: ambassadorship, like limited games, ambassadorship. I feel like that's important here. 190 00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.029 Jenny Duan: You could just like weave that in somehow. 191 00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.310 Jenny Duan: But 192 00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.600 Jenny Duan: to there 193 00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.899 Jenny Duan: creating real world adaptability. I have developed 194 00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.499 Jenny Duan: without compromising the floor. 195 00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:17.729 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel like I'm just right now. I'm visualizing the ending. And I feel like you could write something about like 196 00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.489 Jenny Duan: like the ending. So you're writing all about something where you did not. The ending could be like 197 00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.709 Jenny Duan: the future of video games is 198 00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.409 Jenny Duan: diverse or like. 199 00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:38.749 Jenny Duan: let's use video games as an analogy, for, like the future of the world in your vision, for th",
    "e world like you could say, like the future of video games is diverse where every player has like the chance to succeed, whatever you see. 200 00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.480 Jenny Duan: And and then you could connect it to like 201 00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.310 Jenny Duan: something about like how 202 00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.999 Jenny Duan: the world, too, can be this way, or like our world, or our human world, too, can be this way. 203 00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.990 Jenny Duan: All you have to do is press play. 204 00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.319 Jenny Duan: That could be the end. 205 00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.750 huda: Oh, I like that. 206 00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:00.089 Jenny Duan: Like, okay, like, I'll just write that down the future of video games. 207 00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:08.469 Jenny Duan: And you don't have to use this exact sentence structure for this. But like you can say, like in the future video games, or like the future of video games, what does that look like 208 00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.700 Jenny Duan: that look like? What does your vision for the world look like 209 00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.539 Jenny Duan: of our world 210 00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.210 Jenny Duan: to can, or like our 211 00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.679 Jenny Duan: human world, or our live world, to get like. 212 00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.830 Jenny Duan: be the same? Or 213 00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.209 Jenny Duan: I don't know. 214 00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.449 Jenny Duan: All you have to do is press play. 215 00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.479 huda: Yeah, I had like, I had like a previous like. 216 00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:45.770 huda: I like wrote it on like the notes app or something. But I was just like thinking like how to conclude it. And then there was one conclusion that I wrote was 217 00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:59.939 huda: in the end. Isn't life the ultimate open world game, where all players, switching between roles, acquiring new skills, facing unexpected challenges. My journey thro",
    "ugh virtual worlds prepared me for the complexities of my identity and the importance of representation. 218 00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:13.989 huda: As I look to the future, I I see myself continuing to bridge worlds in technology, culture and society, whether it's through game development, creating animated animated websites or crafting content that resonates with other women in tech. 219 00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:19.250 huda: I hope to design experiences where everyone can level up regardless of their starting stats. 220 00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.340 huda: and then this one was just like a. 221 00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.589 Jenny Duan: That's beautifully, Huna. That's so good. Wait! Can you copy, paste that in right now and then? Continue. I don't want to cut off your train of thought. 222 00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:38.119 huda: And then there was just like a bit which was just like to add a little humor. It was game on level up, and may your Wi-fi connection always be strong and your Bopa always perfectly chewy. 223 00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.439 huda: I don't think that's necessary. 224 00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.440 Jenny Duan: I don't think that's necessary, too, but I love the 1st part. 225 00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.260 Jenny Duan: Can you copy paste that in? I think that's really good. 226 00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.080 huda: I just. 227 00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.950 Jenny Duan: Why did you? Why did you write this. 228 00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:04.039 huda: I wrote this like at school. I don't know. I just like I was thinking of like how I wanted. I wanted like, I like writing like powerful, like ending statements. And then I just I thought of that. 229 00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.860 huda: Yeah. 230 00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.689 Jenny Duan: This is really good, so you could edit the ending to be. However you want, but I feel like that's 231 00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:36.720 Jenny Duan: really good. And then I would say. Just try to add one sentence about Somethoria. I don't like ",
    "not one sentence sorry one. Try to keep your thing about centuria to like just one medium sized paragraph, because I feel like you don't have much room for all else. 232 00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:42.620 Jenny Duan: Let me see how much wording this is like 5 58 words. So you only have, like one big repair. 233 00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.279 huda: Alright! Let me let me apply these edits. 234 00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:14.199 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! You have 200 words left. You have 200 words to write about synthoria. 235 00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.249 Jenny Duan: I feel like, that's a decent yeah. 236 00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:18.580 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 237 00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.040 Jenny Duan: okay. So let's think about how to transition this into syphoria. 238 00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.810 huda: So maybe like. 239 00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.320 huda: I don't know if it's like opening statement might be 240 00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:45.469 huda: too like abstract. But it could be, or like too basic but it could just be like something like this realization 241 00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.879 huda: had made me want to combine all my different. 242 00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.140 huda: I like complexities. 243 00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:58.450 huda: I don't know. I think I actually that doesn't make sense unless they know like what Centhoria is. So 244 00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.420 huda: let me see. 245 00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.970 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can write about like not seeing 246 00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.999 Jenny Duan: yourself represented in games, and then designing your own or 247 00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.159 Jenny Duan: not sure how the best transition here. 248 00:29:29.016 --> 00:29:36.720 huda: Okay? So actually, this last sentence is like, I realized I could explore various facets of myself without compromising my core. 249 00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.000 huda: And like. 250 00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:44.599 huda: I think I can like use instead of having that sentence. Maybe I ",
    "can like 251 00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:50.129 huda: I, I like the core can be synthoria, because it's like, basically who I am to the floor. 252 00:29:50.170 --> 00:30:01.109 huda: It's like tech, combined with storytelling combined with like Indian combined with Muslim. It's like I am to the core so, and maybe, instead of saying like. 253 00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:08.459 huda: I realized so I could be like, I realized I could explore various facets for myself without compromising my core. 254 00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.860 huda: the game I developed synthoria. 255 00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:21.599 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And and then talking about how Synthoria represents your core? Or what about synthoria? Are you highlighting here? 256 00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.639 huda: Yeah. And then, like the sentence that follows, I can be like, 257 00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.940 huda: I could be like 258 00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.050 huda: with a blend. 259 00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.240 huda: This is just like I'm just like writing stuff down. But like 260 00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.861 huda: with a blend of 261 00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.360 huda: data, science 262 00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.919 huda: mixed with storytelling. Oh. 263 00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.779 huda: and storytelling 264 00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.060 huda: Indian. 265 00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.870 huda: That's good 266 00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.990 huda: characters. 267 00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:14.760 huda: I. I could be like, Okay, I don't know if this like 268 00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.449 huda: this is 269 00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:20.489 huda: far, far fetched, but it could be like I personified 270 00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.779 huda: the game. 271 00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.250 huda: or I personified synthoria. 272 00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds good. 273 00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:37.149 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to repeat centurion twice. 274 00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.739 Jenny Duan: but I'm",
    " not sure if this is the smoothest transition 275 00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.369 Jenny Duan: like it still doesn't explain like, why did you develop this game like out of all the games that you wanted to develop? 276 00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.010 Jenny Duan: Why, Sidoria like. 277 00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:02.659 Jenny Duan: why is that? Why was that the idea you chose, instead of just like a fun like wordle thing? 278 00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.130 huda: I'm trying to like. I don't know how to ex like explain it in this way, but like 279 00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:14.170 huda: I think it's just like a combination of like all my different interests, and like 280 00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.000 huda: it's like I mentioned. It's kind of like 281 00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.780 huda: synthoria is kind of like me. 282 00:32:21.428 --> 00:32:23.341 huda: I guess, and then 283 00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.899 huda: like I just I don't know how to put it in this sentence. I think 284 00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.900 huda: I guess I also I also developed it 285 00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:48.969 huda: like, I don't think this like really fits with the theme of the essay. But I also developed it like as an educational tool. Because I don't think I really talk about like being like someone who's interested in education. 286 00:32:49.765 --> 00:32:51.460 huda: Throughout the essay. 287 00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.830 huda: So I don't know if that really relates. But. 288 00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.450 Jenny Duan: Okay. How would you Re, weave that in? 289 00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.020 Jenny Duan: Tell me more about what that looks like? 290 00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.949 huda: like, for example. 291 00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.680 huda: playing like 292 00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:15.578 huda: like to weave it in like, maybe like when I'm talking about like finding a dragon. 293 00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.440 Jenny Duan: Right. 294 00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:23.289 huda: My older sister and then like, I don't know i",
    "f this is too simple of a example. But 295 00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.119 huda: like I'd I'd help her like 296 00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.930 huda: catch on to like the mechanics and like I'd guide her throughout the 297 00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.299 huda: like action. 298 00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:39.120 Jenny Duan: Okay? I feel like that. Seems like a bit of a departure from the rest of the essay. 299 00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.540 Jenny Duan: I agree. 300 00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.359 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 301 00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.579 Jenny Duan: they can be Indian by barricades. 302 00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, maybe we could transition this with like. 303 00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.610 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is too impersonal, but like a statistic like. 304 00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.260 Jenny Duan: let's see oops. 305 00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.209 Jenny Duan: let me look up like video game. 306 00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.900 Jenny Duan: What percentage of video game characters are white or something. 307 00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.810 Jenny Duan: But we could start there. 308 00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:23.460 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. 309 00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.719 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Say. 310 00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.409 Jenny Duan: say 311 00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.829 Jenny Duan: yet, as I found you could say something like, yet, as I 312 00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:37.130 Jenny Duan: as I like found my identity through playing video games. 313 00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.729 Jenny Duan: I realized that like. 314 00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.409 Jenny Duan: I don't know you could. Then you could talk about like 315 00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.370 Jenny Duan: yet like 316 00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:50.750 Jenny Duan: you could say, like, I found you could talk about how you found your duty through video games. Yet 317 00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.269 Jenny Duan: 60% of video gay characters are white. Yet 318 00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.850 Jenny Duan: all th",
    "is has happened like yet there's still so much 319 00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.790 Jenny Duan: right. And then, like. 320 00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.029 Jenny Duan: How do you fix that? etc? 321 00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.470 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that makes sense. 322 00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:18.270 huda: No, I think it definitely does. And then also, I think a bigger statistic is that 79.2% of lead characters are male. 323 00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.550 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, you could say that too, totally. 324 00:35:32.167 --> 00:35:39.819 huda: Actually, no, I think I think the race might be like a little more important to tap on this one, because. 325 00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.570 Jenny Duan: Both you could say like, yet 326 00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.960 Jenny Duan: this our white and this you know. 327 00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:00.870 huda: Let me see. Like, if there's any 328 00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.150 huda: on 329 00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.480 huda: statistics about South Asian. 330 00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.889 huda: okay, I can't find any 331 00:36:46.692 --> 00:36:55.170 huda: statistics about how many South like what the percentage of like South Asian characters are. But I think if I could find that I think that might be stronger. But. 332 00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.560 Jenny Duan: Okay. 333 00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.089 Jenny Duan: I mean, if you can't find it like 334 00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.620 Jenny Duan: that tells you something too right like. 335 00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.740 Jenny Duan: if you can't find it, then it's like, Oh, well, like. 336 00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.430 huda: Yeah, that's right. 337 00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:11.299 Jenny Duan: So not good. Right? That means that there's maybe like too little representation that they don't even track it, which is 338 00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.069 Jenny Duan: like, that's bad, too, you know. 339 00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:13.930 huda: Yeah. 340 00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:14.730 Jenny Duan: Oh. 341 00:37:",
    "16.000 --> 00:37:20.520 Jenny Duan: yeah, no. Information also tells you some information. 342 00:37:23.887 --> 00:37:43.530 huda: Okay. So video games taught me that I can be a programmer and a journalist. I can be Indian and Muslim and I can be immigrant and American. I found my complex identity through video games. Yet 79.2% of video game characters are male. Yet 54.2% of video game protagonists are white. 343 00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:06.750 huda: my, okay, wait. I don't know if this is too much of a stretch, but it could be something like my identity was made up of video games. But video games weren't made up of my identity. 344 00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:15.469 Jenny Duan: I think that's great. I think we might like change the wording a little bit. But like, Let's, that's let's start with that. That looks good. 345 00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:37.640 Jenny Duan: Okay. This, I think, could all be consolidated to like one sentence. 346 00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.969 Jenny Duan: But it's fine for now 347 00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.130 Jenny Duan: let's see. 348 00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.559 huda: I just do. 349 00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.677 Jenny Duan: That? How's that? 350 00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.050 huda: Yeah. 351 00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.660 huda: Oh, okay, yeah. I like that. 352 00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.609 huda: yeah, I think that blends it like perfectly. 353 00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.860 Jenny Duan: I developed ziptoria with 354 00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.760 Jenny Duan: substitution. 355 00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.401 Jenny Duan: with the best of video game 356 00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.770 Jenny Duan: with my favorite 357 00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.939 Jenny Duan: aspects of video. Or 358 00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:48.179 Jenny Duan: I don't want to stretch this too much. I think you should just write this next pair like you should just write this paragraph about like, why, you've developed syphoria and like what you've learned or like what? How? You've grown since that ",
    "process 359 00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.300 Jenny Duan: that would be good 360 00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.170 Jenny Duan: and you have like about, yeah, go ahead. 361 00:39:55.510 --> 00:40:03.140 huda: Sorry. Should I still do the story with like wanting to like, change the characters, names, and then like overcoming that. 362 00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:08.339 Jenny Duan: I I, personally wouldn't write that. Because I feel like you have 363 00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.979 Jenny Duan: not. You have like such limited word, count. So it might be better to focus on other aspects such as like 364 00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.160 Jenny Duan: the impact of the game or your learning development through the game. Because. 365 00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.840 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that it's fine to. Don't write about that for now. 366 00:40:23.702 --> 00:40:25.109 huda: Okay, that sounds good. 367 00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:37.560 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like this essay is in really good shape. So we'll just talk about it during our next meeting. But I want to spend some time going over your Stanford supplements. Now, that's okay. If we could transition to that, yeah. 368 00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.260 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. I have that open 369 00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:50.800 Jenny Duan: So this is all about synthoria. 370 00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.250 Jenny Duan: because 371 00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:54.910 Jenny Duan: so 372 00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.109 Jenny Duan: my now primary concern is. 373 00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.239 Jenny Duan: does this overlap too much with your 374 00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.520 Jenny Duan: call? That statement. 375 00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.310 huda: Yeah, I feel like 376 00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:18.849 huda: it definitely has some similarities. And that's all kind of concerned about because, well, this one, okay, they kind of like different topics like gamified education and like finding different identities through video games. 377 00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.650",
    " huda: But I feel like 378 00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:26.319 huda: I don't know if they get a lot of like video game essays. So like, maybe they might just like. 379 00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.950 huda: think that like my only personality, trait is video games. 380 00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.865 Jenny Duan: Okay. 381 00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.340 Jenny Duan: let's see. 382 00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:52.230 Jenny Duan: Oh, oh. 383 00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:59.270 Jenny Duan: so this should be like something about like what you hope to study. 384 00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:03.179 Jenny Duan: And at synrod. Are you applying to the Sts. Major? 385 00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.120 huda: Yeah. 386 00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.369 Jenny Duan: Okay, what specific concentration with an Sts over time. 387 00:42:09.492 --> 00:42:11.479 huda: Communications and media. 388 00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:15.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. 389 00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.285 Jenny Duan: up. 390 00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.260 Jenny Duan: let's come back to this essay. 391 00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:22.850 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 392 00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:23.530 huda: Room, also. 393 00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.309 Jenny Duan: Go back to this essay. I feel like I might need to think about this. Go ahead. 394 00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:49.280 huda: I, looked into like the courses for the concentration of the communication and media for Sts, and it's like, really focused on data journalism, and so maybe instead of talking about like video game development, I can focus more on like data like my data science background. And then like, how I'm curious about like how 395 00:42:49.280 --> 00:43:09.209 huda: data can tell stories. I feel like a lot of people might be saying that already, with like, people are trying to get into like the data science at, like the Cs like aspect. But if I'm like able to kind of show, focus more on like the storytelling part. Maybe that could be like a better use of like this essay. 396 00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:24.449 J",
    "enny Duan: I agree. I also like love this essay. So I don't want you to abandon it entirely. I'm thinking maybe we could use this for University of California, like I feel like since there is. How long are their essays? I'm sorry. Let me check. I don't remember. 397 00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.210 Jenny Duan: Hello! Hello! 398 00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.690 huda: 3. 50. Words. 399 00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:32.539 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's just repurpose this and stick it into the Ucsas. 400 00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.760 Jenny Duan: I cause I love this essay. It's like a great essay. I think it deserves its light. But 401 00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:42.620 Jenny Duan: maybe not for Stanford, since they already have your common app, which is like pretty similar. 402 00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.960 Jenny Duan: So okay. 403 00:43:45.510 --> 00:44:02.479 Jenny Duan: then, we can adjust this to Uc, so can you just save this in like another document, or just whatever just retain a copy of it. And I think writing an essay about data journalism would be probably more related to your major. And then it wouldn't be as repetitive because your comment up is already so much about games. 404 00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.060 Jenny Duan: But this essay won't get wasted. It'll just be used for something else, which is fine. 405 00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:13.140 huda: Okay, yeah. I just saved in a different document. 406 00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.670 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 407 00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.290 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I think, here. 408 00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.679 Jenny Duan: I feel like. 409 00:44:23.734 --> 00:44:27.255 Jenny Duan: I love this about Syrians. 410 00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.589 Jenny Duan: okay, this is great. This is only 2 50 words. Right? 411 00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.680 huda: Yeah. 412 00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:46.370 Jenny Duan: Okay? 413 00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:04.430 Jenny Duan: Great. 414 00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:13.280 Jenny Duan: Okay? Instead of calculus cram sessions. Let's ",
    "change this into something that's like slightly more positive. 415 00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:24.950 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like X rabbit holes back home, or like Wikipedia, deep dives, or something that emphasizes your curiosity rather than just a focus on like getting good grades or cramming for an exam. 416 00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:33.489 huda: I was I was thinking of like doing cause my like calculus cram sessions were usually times where, like I listened like jazz in the background. 417 00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.700 Jenny Duan: Oh! 418 00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:39.489 huda: I like thought of that. But I think, yeah, it could definitely be something different. Like. 419 00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.809 huda: like, my. 420 00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.640 huda: maybe like 421 00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:54.099 huda: algorithm, like algorithm, like form diving like like on Reddit, like the 422 00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.340 huda: I guess, like. 423 00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.600 huda: yeah. 424 00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.060 huda: So maybe instead, I could put like. 425 00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:25.920 huda: Oh. 426 00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. 427 00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.120 huda: And also I don't know if this seems like an information dump 428 00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.390 huda: like right here. 429 00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:46.900 Jenny Duan: I don't think so. 430 00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:47.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. 431 00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:58.019 Jenny Duan: oh, yeah. Another thing that there might be a lot of repetition is your like moment in history is also about able data, lovely. So I would. 432 00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.120 huda: This Hopper. 433 00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.469 Jenny Duan: Oh, Grace Hopper, sorry. 434 00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.930 Jenny Duan: Let me just check it one more time. 435 00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.663 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, sorry. It's not about it's not. It's not about 436 00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.349 Jenny Duan: okay. I feel like. 437 00:47:15",
    ".470 --> 00:47:18.900 Jenny Duan: but I feel like Anna Lovelace and Grace Hopper are like 2 438 00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:29.250 Jenny Duan: influential leaders, but it's also a bit cliche, not a bit cliche, but like, they're the 1st people people like, they're the 1st terms. If you like, Google, like famous woman in computer science like, you'll get their names. 439 00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.659 Jenny Duan: So maybe it'd be better to do something that's like slightly more 440 00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:36.930 Jenny Duan: niche, or something that like slightly more unique. For the second essay. 441 00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:47.369 Jenny Duan: like the one about the historical moment, because I feel like anyone who's interested any woman. It's yes, could write about Grace Hopper like that doesn't add anything to about your story. 442 00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.940 huda: Hmm. 443 00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:02.474 Jenny Duan: But I don't like. What are your thoughts? Feel free to push back. 444 00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:05.470 huda: I mean, like. 445 00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:32.499 huda: I'm sure. Yeah, I think like I was also thinking might be a little too cliche, because there's I feel like a lot of like women in tech are like interested in like, especially Ada Lovelace and like, I don't know about Grace Hopper. I wasn't aware that she's like, really popular. But yeah, I think I could if I could find something that's more specific to like what I'm doing. So at Stanford. That would be like data journalism. Let me see if I could find any like 446 00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.809 huda: Dana journalists back in the day that were like. 447 00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.160 huda: Okay, so 448 00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:22.270 huda: I don't see like specifically like historic, like, what like, what do we define as historical in this like? Does it have to be like 449 00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.819 huda: like 100 years ago, or like. 450 00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:29.730 huda: Could it be something that happened",
    " like in the sixties or seventies. 451 00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:41.409 Jenny Duan: I feel like something that could have happened. It could be as historical as you want. 452 00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:50.250 huda: cause I, it looks like data journalists, mainly like, started in. 453 00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.590 Jenny Duan: It doesn't have to be data journalism. It could also be anything else. 454 00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.839 huda: Like, would it have to be technology related. 455 00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.560 Jenny Duan: No, not necessarily. 456 00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.640 huda: Hmm! 457 00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.720 huda: And I'm not really sure like 458 00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.419 huda: what? Specifically, I'd be looking for. 459 00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.930 Jenny Duan: Like. Let's see what other things about your profile. Have you not yet emphasized. 460 00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.459 huda: I don't believe I've talked about 461 00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:32.610 huda: journalism at all. Actually, I think I talked a little bit in my like 462 00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.919 huda: this and like y U.S.A, for like the 463 00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:40.450 huda: like, the contributions essay 464 00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:45.090 huda: so 465 00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.293 huda: I don't think I talked about teaching 466 00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.079 huda: and like both. 467 00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.720 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that could be good. 468 00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.099 Jenny Duan: Maybe like a famous lecture by, like. 469 00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:20.320 Jenny Duan: I don't like, yeah, just like a famous lecture that 470 00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.559 Jenny Duan: you're curious, though. 471 00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:32.779 huda: Maybe, like the first, st like university was actually like founded by, I think, like I think it was like a Muslim woman. 472 00:51:33.121 --> 00:51:34.679 huda: Let me just double check. 473 00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 474 00:51:54.710 --> 00",
    ":52:01.597 huda: Yeah, she was Muslim, American or not American, but like a Muslim woman, and she found the 475 00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.530 huda: She found the 1st university. 476 00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 477 00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.510 huda: That's cool. 478 00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.180 huda: like founding like when she founded that. 479 00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:20.619 huda: Or actually, I'm looking at this. And like, there's different answers online. 480 00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.539 huda: Yeah. But I think this one's like the oldest is like 859. 481 00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.750 huda: this other one was in 1,088. But 482 00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.849 huda: yeah, I think I think it's accurate. 483 00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:43.970 huda: Yep. 484 00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.120 Jenny Duan: Sounds good. 485 00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:58.539 huda: So actually like. 486 00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:47.770 huda: And 487 00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.880 huda: oh, yeah, for for this one. 488 00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:24.060 huda: number 3, like, what aspects of your life experiences, interests and character would you like 489 00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:36.559 huda: would help you make a distinctive contribution? Like, I was wondering how I could approach those changes like how I can like highlight things about like myself rather than just like 490 00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:43.409 huda: cause. I I tried doing it in the stuff, but, like I, I can see like how it's more focused on Stanford than myself. 491 00:54:44.500 --> 00:55:05.849 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that right here this really sticks out like at Stanford. I won't just be the girl in the corner anymore. I'll be. But you don't want to emphasize like how Stanford will change you. You want to emphasize. How are you going to change this institution? And how are you going to make an impact on the institution? And I feel like that's like the fundamental mindset shift that I would like to see here. It's not like. 492 00:55:",
    "05.850 --> 00:55:18.590 Jenny Duan: because the roommate essay is more like how Stanford's going to influence you, and how it'll make you a different person. But this essay is is more focused on like, what are you doing to make a difference at Stanford? Does that like mental flip? 493 00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:20.300 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense to you? 494 00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.279 huda: Yeah, I mean, I think I 495 00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:33.033 huda: I think I tried with these like bullet points where I talked about how I'll start like the Cardinal, which is like the Sanford themed World game. 496 00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:40.300 huda: And then I talked about starting like a column in the Stanford daily called overheard of the quad 497 00:55:40.974 --> 00:55:48.090 huda: and then building like bridges between the Muslim Student Union and the South Asian Society Club. 498 00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:50.630 huda: and like 499 00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.890 huda: making spaces where both of these identities can exist. 500 00:55:54.940 --> 00:56:00.309 huda: And then the and then the last bullet point was talked about the Stanford women in computer science. 501 00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:13.585 huda: And then, like showing other quiet girls that they, their voices matter in tech. And then I think I tried conveying like, how I can make like an impact in these clubs and whatnot. But 502 00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:20.260 huda: yeah, I don't know if I'm like, if I can like, focus on myself a little more in this. 503 00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:22.560 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 504 00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.269 Jenny Duan: So okay, let's let's focus. 505 00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.539 Jenny Duan: I feel like we've talked a lot today. So let's 506 00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:35.990 Jenny Duan: like trying to think about this briefly. And then we can continue talking about this the next time we meet, which is on 507 00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:39.130 Jenny Duan: Friday. So 508 00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:50.659 Jenny",
    " Duan: what do you think makes you just forget about the essay just like we could just talk. What do you think makes you differentiated as a candidate to state for university? And why should they take you over 509 00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.980 Jenny Duan: all of the girls who are applied for all the Bay Area girls who are applied were 510 00:56:56.010 --> 00:57:00.070 Jenny Duan: all the just applicant pool in general like, why are you 511 00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.520 Jenny Duan: important enough. 512 00:57:03.188 --> 00:57:05.459 huda: I think it's because I've like 513 00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:12.009 huda: a like keen interest in like not just like going to Stanford to like hire my own education. 514 00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:28.369 huda: but like also building like collective platform for other people who also get admitted. So like, for example, like the connections that I'd make at Stanford, like I feel like I want to use those connections to create something bigger. 515 00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:34.150 huda: Just to name an example like like, I explained earlier, like the 516 00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:42.810 huda: like bridging like 2 clubs together, like forming like alliances, so that so that, like. 517 00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:47.179 huda: I don't know, like identities can coexist, and like, I think. 518 00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:53.880 huda: like bringing making, like Stanford, more interconnected. And I think, like the reason why I'm like a good candidate for that 519 00:57:53.930 --> 00:58:00.790 huda: is because, like of my different skills of like, I guess, being like a gentle leader. 520 00:58:01.366 --> 00:58:04.100 huda: also being someone who's like. 521 00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:18.700 huda: kind of more technically skilled in like data, science or technology. And so I can like code these things to help promote like connectivity within Stanford. And yeah, I think those are the things that really set me apart. 522 00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.869 Jenny Duan: Okay, great",
    ". I feel like this. Essay needs to be reformatted and rewritten. 523 00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:32.900 Jenny Duan: I think this, like dear Diary format, doesn't lend itself like the gravity that you want in this essay, because this essay is all about like impact. Because. 524 00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:56.929 Jenny Duan: like, I said, like colleges, invest a lot of resources into every student like. Of course, you pay a lot of tuition, sure, but like they also invest a lot into like ensuring that you are a successful alumni that will like lend credibility to Stanford's name in the future. So you need to think about like, what legacy do you want to leave in the future and like, why does that align with Stanford's goals, or Stanford's Mission, or Stanford's 525 00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.430 Jenny Duan: presentation? 526 00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:06.309 Jenny Duan: And I think this essay needs more gravity than like a dear diary format can like naturally lend. 527 00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:12.809 Jenny Duan: I don't know. What are your thoughts on that feel free to disagree, challenge me like I don't know. I'm just putting out ideas. 528 00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:19.150 huda: So I'm just. I'm just wondering like, is it like? Because, like the dear Jerry might be like. 529 00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:29.750 huda: I can be talking like to myself about like how? Why, I can be good for Stanford. But like, if I were to like, do in a different format like and like a normal like standard essay. 530 00:59:30.044 --> 00:59:35.070 huda: I can like see? I don't know. Actually, I don't know if this essay is supposed to be like 531 00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:40.129 huda: more straightforward or like, if I should like take a creative approach to it. 532 00:59:40.524 --> 00:59:45.070 huda: And like I just, I don't know how to make it sound like it's 533 00:59:45.444 --> 00:59:48.689 huda: not just like listing different things I do at Stanford. 534 00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:52.520 huda: Which I guess I kinda do ",
    "right now. But like. 535 00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.010 huda: yeah, like, I just don't know how to make it more cohesive, I think. 536 00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:02.979 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's just the format of dear Diary doesn't make it feel serious 537 01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:08.870 Jenny Duan: like you wanna increase like the seriousness of this essay like this might be a place where you think like. 538 01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:21.260 Jenny Duan: you know, like talk about the struggles that you've experienced or like what you've had to overcome and like, how's how you're gonna change the world based on your experiences like, what are you gonna take about your experiences and like. 539 01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.870 Jenny Duan: it's basically about how you're going to change the world. 540 01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:36.270 Jenny Duan: if, like, you're gonna change the world. You know that you are but like how and in what ways? And how does this influence, Stanford. Why does Stanford have to be a part of your journey like what resources here can you leverage for your journey, and like? How will you shape 541 01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:40.730 Jenny Duan: the future of Stanford like it's about like, for example. 542 01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:48.300 Jenny Duan: as an AI ethics advocate that you will continue advocating for AI ethics to change the landscape of what technology looks like or like 543 01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.830 Jenny Duan: as a game developer, you're developing like the 544 01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:01.069 Jenny Duan: platforms of tomorrow or like, what are you doing? That's like so impactful that, like you have to be here. And why do they need you there, too? 545 01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:03.499 Jenny Duan: And here it's also a good place to emphasize, like 546 01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:09.929 Jenny Duan: maybe any struggles that you've experienced in your journey, because this is like where you could get some brownie points, for, like. 547 01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:15.140 Jen",
    "ny Duan: you know, you have, like experience struggling to talk about like financial insecurity could talk about like 548 01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:27.079 Jenny Duan: Co. Like, I think Raj said, that sorry your dad said that like now you qualify for food assistance like that's like something that I would put here, because, like Stanford, very much cares about like 549 01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:47.920 Jenny Duan: overcoming adversity. And like, that's something that you want to like highlight, because that's 1 thing that's unique. It sets your profile part. This is the part where, remember all the essays that you wrote about coming from Mountain house, and like this, like small town like, make it like, you know, like all of that, I think should come out in this essay, because, like those, are all really important parts of your story that I feel like you haven't written about yet. 550 01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:48.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 551 01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.899 huda: I agree, I think. Yeah. Then I'll write a different like, draft of this. I think I'll try and like. 552 01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:01.170 huda: like, I'll kind of like maintain some of these ideas like, I think I still think. 553 01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:02.490 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Totally. 554 01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:05.399 huda: The wordle idea. I don't know if that's like 555 01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:11.450 huda: I feel like, that's just an idea that I really want to contribute to Stanford. And I'm really excited to like 556 01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:21.739 huda: opportunity to like, contribute that. So I think that's something that I'll continue writing about. But I think, yeah, like bringing in like different, like adversities. Maybe I think. 557 01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:29.019 huda: like you said that could probably like give me like Brownie points, or like, tell people more about like things that I didn't mention already. 558 01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:44.260 Jenny Duan: Exactly yeah, like instead of like, I would say, o",
    "verheard of the quad is something that like, would this would go more into a roommate essay for this I would write something like, Don't write this exactly because I I don't. I think this is a bit cliche, but like it's more along the lines of like 559 01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:47.069 Jenny Duan: you want to use your voice as a beacon 560 01:02:47.200 --> 01:03:00.040 Jenny Duan: truth, just like how you do in folklift, like continuing your mission of folklift like highlighting small businesses to the world, or advancing economic opportunity for those experiencing with the most adversity during the pandemic, or like something like that where it just sounds like a bit more like. 561 01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:04.160 Jenny Duan: I don't know if you understand what I mean by like that tone change. 562 01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.200 huda: Yeah, like that. 563 01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.890 Jenny Duan: What's the difference between this essay and like the ruby essay. 564 01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:10.050 huda: Hmm, okay. I see. 565 01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:24.510 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. I feel like this is a good stopping point. We've talked a lot. I'll send a recap email with some notes. But do you feel prepared to meet on Friday again? With these changes in mind, both in your common app and a couple of these essays. 566 01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:32.159 huda: Yeah, I think I think that's enough times like for me to update. And then I I think on Friday we're working on the Usc supplementals. 567 01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:32.760 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 568 01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.319 Jenny Duan: So let's talk about that. Let's let's start with the Usc. And then. 569 01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:40.509 Jenny Duan: so you haven't written anything yet, right? Or have you. 570 01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:50.010 huda: I've written just like some like ideas that I had for some of them. But they're just like not for like the like, the 2 50 word ones just for, like the short answers. 571 01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.93",
    "0 Jenny Duan: Okay, so let's start with those. And then. 572 01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:57.609 Jenny Duan: once we're done, or if we have time, we can come back to these Stanford settlements. 573 01:03:57.970 --> 01:03:59.560 huda: Okay. Sounds good. 574 01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:04.919 Jenny Duan: Cool. See you, Friday, and let me know if you have anything before, then feel free to text me, or like, send documents my way. 575 01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:07.300 huda: Okay, thank you. 576 01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:07.960 Jenny Duan: Bye."
