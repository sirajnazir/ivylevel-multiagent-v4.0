00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.570
Jenny Duan: Hi, Hunter, it's nice to meet you.

2
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.540
Ankur Shah: Hi, hold on 1 s. Sorry

3
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.390
Ankur Shah: today.

4
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.040
Jenny Duan: Eric!

5
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.820
Jenny Duan: Hello.

6
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.637
Ankur Shah: How are you?

7
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.070
Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. How are you?

8
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.894
Ankur Shah: And

9
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.070
Ankur Shah: this is our end.

10
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.829
Jenny Duan: Hi Arian, so nice to meet you. Give us a second. I think Sir Rojas is

11
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.920
Jenny Duan: going to join soon.

12
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.380
Ankur Shah: It's a lot of people.

13
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.250
Jenny Duan: Solely.

14
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.980
Jenny Duan: Okay, there we go. Saraje's on.

15
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.040
Jenny Duan: hey, Saraj?

16
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.365
Ivylevel: Hey?

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.759
Ivylevel: hey? How's it going? Sorry? Yeah. I was trying to start. I was not sure, because we had a few people joining, so

18
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:27.706
Ivylevel: I wasn't sure if you know who was the who was the host? So it was Jenny, you you were the host, so I mean we are all good here. Thanks a lot for your time, ankur, and so sorry. Uncle

19
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.720
Ivylevel: Aryan, right.

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.998
Ankur Shah: Yeah, Arian. And Lena, yeah, Hunker is not here. But yeah, my zoom is unclear. So yeah.

21
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:53.380
Ivylevel: No, yeah, no worries. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, thanks a lot for your time. And actually, I do have like a full fledged team here. We typically, like, you know, start with Jenny, who's our head coach, you know, being Pm leadership team of Iv level. And you know, you know, she's done really a fabulous job and has actually really, like, you know, carved out

22
00:01:53.622 --> 00:02:08.890
Ivylevel: multiple, like, you know, probably hundreds of different game plans. And you know, strategies for different students and transform any students as well. So I think, got the best today who's gonna run it and also like what we do in this 2 weeks, as we said. Right? One of the primary kind of questions you had, Lena and Uncle was

23
00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:10.162
Ivylevel: to really

24
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:36.819
Ivylevel: find the right fit in terms of the coach that actually would be partnering with Ayan. I think the way. And again, as I said, we are a team. That's our kind of unique value proposition. However, we do need like a primary coach. But I again at the end of the day. So we have 2 other coaches that I've actually invited today, based on the early kind of inputs that we received so that is Rishi and Janu.

25
00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:49.189
Ivylevel: You know, both are, actually, quite quite, quite an amazing combination of stem and arts. And you know, you know, kind of humanities. Sophomore cs, and

26
00:02:49.584 --> 00:02:50.920
Ivylevel: you know, data science

27
00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:14.890
Ivylevel: drummer community impact lot of great things they've done. So I think they're just gonna listen in mostly to kind of because then we take back based on this is really Jenny kind of driving the entire session, getting to really know. You know, Ian at his core right to discover many things, and I think she's done. It's it's an art and science that she's kind of mastered and we have done it with many, many students. So after that

28
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:31.090
Ivylevel: we'll spend the entire week as a team, we'll have more input. And data coming in trying to figure out what's the right strategy? What's the right tactical plan and roadmap that I've shown you? But also find, you know, who could actually be a good match and fit to partner with the ion

29
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:50.429
Ivylevel: and then, I think, during the course of the period, I'm more than happy to have a few kind of you know. Quick touch base where they, you know Ian, can actually speak with the coach that we have in mind, and then, after a week, we'll have another follow up 1 h session where we'll, you know. Jenny will actually, collectively, you know, it's a collective kind of review process, and we'll present the report and we'll get more. Follow up questions from you.

30
00:03:50.662 --> 00:04:01.140
Ivylevel: And in that way, you know, we can then get started with the long term program. So that make like, you know, I'll I'll just let Jenny kind of pick it off. Thanks a lot Rishi, and Jana. Also for joining today.

31
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:14.449
Jenny Duan: Amazing. So nice to meet you. I thought I would also provide a little bit of context on how this session will go, so I'll spend a first couple of minutes just introducing myself and then asking a couple of questions to get to know you, and then

32
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:39.689
Jenny Duan: we'll start talking first about the academics, and then move on to the extracurriculars and the motivations so kind of doing a holistic assessment, how an admissions officer might view a student starting from their academics to their extracurriculars and everything else but the goal of this session. Arian is just to get to know each other. It's I want you to be feel super comfortable with saying, whatever whatever's on your mind don't feel like you need to hold anything back.

33
00:04:39.850 --> 00:05:03.809
Jenny Duan: So yeah, super nice to meet you. My name is Jenny. I'm a current sophomore at Stanford, where I study Cs psychology and philosophy, and I've been working with Saraje and with Iv level for about a year. Now. I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, but of course, now I live in the Bay for school. I'd love to hear a little bit about you if you want to introduce yourself, and maybe tell me your name, what grade you're in and what school and city you're from.

34
00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:06.797
Ankur Shah: My name's Aaron

35
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.080
Ankur Shah: I live in San Jose, and I go to Valley Christian.

36
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.789
Jenny Duan: Amazing! What year are you in school.

37
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:15.779
Ankur Shah: I'm in ninth right now.

38
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.950
Jenny Duan: Cool. I've one of my best friends actually went to Valley Christian. How is it.

39
00:05:21.796 --> 00:05:22.570
Ankur Shah: It's good!

40
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.650
Jenny Duan: It's good. How is like the school year going? Are you getting ready for Ap? Testing? How do you feel about that?

41
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.279
Ankur Shah: one of my classes is getting ready for ap testing.

42
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.230
Ankur Shah: But yeah, it's going well.

43
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.899
Jenny Duan: It's going well. And do you have good friends and everything at school?

44
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.470
Ankur Shah: Yeah.

45
00:05:41.940 --> 00:06:01.919
Jenny Duan: Awesome. Well, I'd love to learn a little bit about what classes you're taking and sort of what you're enrolled, and I know it's your first year in high school, and that can be such a scary place. I remember when I was in high School freshman Year was always the most, I think, after freshman year things get a lot easier. Is my advice. But yeah, what classes are you enrolled in right now?

46
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.890
Ankur Shah: Right now I'm in.

47
00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:10.110
Ankur Shah: Precalculus honors.

48
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:24.230
Ankur Shah: PE biology, honors, business fundamentals ap computer science principles, Spanish, 2 English, 9 honors and a Bible class.

49
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.750
Jenny Duan: Cool.

50
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.340
Jenny Duan: that's a lot of honors classes. Does it feel tough to balance? Or are you managing it? Okay.

51
00:06:33.084 --> 00:06:35.390
Ankur Shah: I think I'm managing it. Okay.

52
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.549
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Like.

53
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:51.150
Ankur Shah: Recalc is giving him the the hardest time, because it's just so fast. And in his school what happens is from pre calc honors they learn a little bit of calculus, so he go. He would go directly to BC. So it's just.

54
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.929
Jenny Duan: Like oh!

55
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.209
Ankur Shah: Really fast. My daughter took it, too. So it's

56
00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:02.230
Ankur Shah: it's supposed to be one of the most challenging classes, even though. And he's taking it in ninth grade, which is crazy, but you know so.

57
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:26.389
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Well, props to you. And I could definitely relate to that. When I was in high school I also went to a Catholic High School. I went to a Jesuit High School in Portland, Oregon, so I know all about the Bible study the required mass. I'm familiar. I'm not Catholic. But I'm very familiar with how these systems work. And I, I know that definitely. That jump to BC is really difficult. That's what I did, too, and when I was in high school I went straight into BC. Too. And

58
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:38.580
Jenny Duan: I know that can be really challenging, but I'm sure you're pushing through it. And you're almost done with the school year, too. And I think once you have that calculus background. BC, it gets better. I think Precock is actually one of the toughest classes, but I think.

59
00:07:38.580 --> 00:08:01.450
Jenny Duan: in my opinion, I think Calc is a little bit easier, because you don't have to do as much memorization for all the formulas. But hopefully you'll feel the same way, too. Do you like the Bible study classes? I'm curious what drove you to choose the religious school for me. I chose my high school because it had the best, like academics out of every school, even though it was Catholic. But I'm curious, like, what were your motivations to to choose Valley? Christian.

60
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:11.499
Ankur Shah: I guess probably my motivations more than him. It was just the it was like, you know, the area that we live in San Jose, especially initially, the public schools just weren't great. So we really didn't.

61
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.010
Jenny Duan: Which way?

62
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:21.629
Ankur Shah: Had to kind of put him in a private school. But my daughter's been through it. She's a senior this year, and so far. It's a it's a good school, I don't think it's like the most academically rigorous.

63
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:28.869
Ankur Shah: You know. It's up there, but not like, you know. But it's a good nurturing school with a lot of

64
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:34.359
Ankur Shah: gives you a lot of opportunities for different things. You just have to kind of take them, you know. So.

65
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:47.430
Jenny Duan: Yeah, Arian, I'm curious. What are your thoughts? When I was in high school my sister was also. She was 3 years younger, too, so she was a freshman as a senior, too. Do you like having her sister around like having someone to drive you places, or is that like? Do you get annoyed when she says Hi! To you in the hallways.

66
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.299
Ankur Shah: I guess it's good cause she can drive me to school every morning.

67
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.720
Ankur Shah: Yeah.

68
00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:00.220
Jenny Duan: And and what's it like for you going to a religious school? Is it hard to leave your friends, or have you made new friends? There.

69
00:09:01.272 --> 00:09:04.250
Ankur Shah: Well, I've been here since fifth grade, so.

70
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.099
Jenny Duan: Oh, wow!

71
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.160
Ankur Shah: For a while.

72
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:12.420
Jenny Duan: Got it. So I'm curious out of all your classes. What's your favorite class so far.

73
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.760
Ankur Shah: probably be.

74
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.320
Jenny Duan: PE. Yeah, do you play any sports? Do you play sports at school?

75
00:09:20.678 --> 00:09:22.470
Ankur Shah: Yeah, I do. Varsity tennis.

76
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.189
Jenny Duan: Oh, super cool! How long have you been playing tennis for.

77
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.000
Ankur Shah: maybe 4 or 5 years.

78
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.639
Jenny Duan: Well, we'll get back to that later. I'm curious what classes you're forecasted for next year.

79
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.539
Ankur Shah: you don't have a list. But I I can kind of remember. So calc, BC,

80
00:09:45.843 --> 00:09:48.250
Ankur Shah: ap computer science, a.

81
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.690
Ankur Shah: of course, a Bible class, English, 10 honors.

82
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.720
Ankur Shah: Cam. Honors.

83
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.570
Ankur Shah: Spanish, 3 honors, Spanish, 3 honors.

84
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.879
Ankur Shah: Ap. Physics, one.

85
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:13.350
Ankur Shah: Yeah. So he's this should be one more still. 8. Right? So he's trying to do cam honors and physics Ap. Next year, but he has to like get a form for that, so we're not sure

86
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:27.509
Ankur Shah: that he'll be able to get into Ap. Physics. If he doesn't get into ap physics, then he'll take in entrepreneurship honors, which is like the Second Level Business Fundamentals. There's one more class. Oh, yeah, world history. Yeah. Ap, world history.

87
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:36.599
Jenny Duan: It's a lot of ap as well. I'm curious what your grades are looking like right now. Do you have good grades like? Do you have a mix of A's and B's? What's that looking like.

88
00:10:37.569 --> 00:10:38.829
Ankur Shah: Right now, the

89
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.419
Ankur Shah: Milos is at 87 in precock

90
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.680
Ankur Shah: and the hmm

91
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.909
Ankur Shah: the oven. I need 3 in bio

92
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.579
Ankur Shah: 92 in computer science, 95 in English.

93
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.760
Ankur Shah: 96 in Spanish and 98 in business fundamentals.

94
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.069
Jenny Duan: Do you remember what your grades were last semester? Oh.

95
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.349
Ankur Shah: Same. Yeah.

96
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.759
Ankur Shah: So he has one B in Precalc right now, basically, everything else is A's.

97
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.659
Jenny Duan: Okay. And that was the same for last semester, too.

98
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.840
Ankur Shah: Last semester at all is 4.5.

99
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:28.528
Jenny Duan: Oh, wow! Super super impressive as a freshman. I would encourage you to try to keep that those grades up for the rest of the semester, too. I know you can do it, and 87 is not too far off from an A. You have a lot of opportunities to improve that, but I would encourage you to really try to keep your Gpa up, if possible.

100
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:52.390
Jenny Duan: obviously one. B is not going to be the end. I'll be all. But I I believe that you have it in you because you have you gotten straight days last semester, so I know you can do it again. This one and your schedule for next year looks really stacked so props to you. I know that you're only a freshman, but do you have any plans to take standardized testing in the future like, are you planning to take the sat? And do you know, when you plan to take it like sophomore junior here in the future.

101
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.240
Ankur Shah: I think I'm taking sat

102
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.740
Ankur Shah: Junior Year.

103
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.720
Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool.

104
00:11:59.207 --> 00:12:05.110
Ankur Shah: So he takes, and their school requires them to take like this. Tuesday, actually a psat, 8, 9.

105
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.599
Ankur Shah: Is required for the school, and then I think he'll take the standard Psat in October.

106
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.439
Ankur Shah: P. As A. P. Yeah.

107
00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:36.630
Jenny Duan: The psat. 8 9 is pretty in inconsequential, I would say. But the psat 10 I would try to do well on that, even if it doesn't count for national merit, because the psat 10 a lot of people say that the psat is not important, but it actually is probably more important than you think, because you can use that score to supplement different applications that you do. For instance, for summer programs for awards

108
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:57.620
Jenny Duan: and for qualification to other programs. So even though people say that the Ps. 18 is 10 is inconsequential. I think it's a plus. If you do well, it won't harm you if you do bad, but it is a plus, if you do well, so I would try to at least put a little bit effort of effort into studying. Not too much, but just, you know, preparing a little bit for it.

109
00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:08.269
Jenny Duan: I'm curious now. You were talking about doing tennis earlier. It seems like you're super athletic. I'd love to know what other things you spend time doing outside of school, and if you're involved in any clubs.

110
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.000
Ankur Shah: Right now. Sometimes I go to an investment club.

111
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.380
Ankur Shah: Mondays and Thursdays.

112
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.820
Ankur Shah: and then I have a

113
00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:22.990
Ankur Shah: after school program deco that I go to.

114
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.110
Ankur Shah: I gotcha.

115
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.060
Ankur Shah: I think that's it.

116
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:40.340
Jenny Duan: That's it cool. So those are the clubs. It seems like you're really interested in business, right? I mean, you're taking introduction to you're taking business fundamentals. You're doing all these business related clubs. How long have you been interested in business for.

117
00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:42.740
Ankur Shah: Maybe

118
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.245
Ankur Shah: just this year. But I I've always been interested in this.

119
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.360
Jenny Duan: This year?

120
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:56.400
Jenny Duan: Got it? What got what inspired you to become interested in business? Did you do something, or did you start a business? Or was this just kind of interesting to you.

121
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.419
Ankur Shah: I think it's probably my dad.

122
00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.510
Ankur Shah: He probably.

123
00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.169
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Can you tell me more about that.

124
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.170
Ankur Shah: He, I mean, he's in business

125
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.931
Ankur Shah: and tech. So I kinda wanna do what he does. So

126
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.609
Ankur Shah: and I like just like the inside of what he does.

127
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:30.290
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's super inspiring. And and I mean, do you see yourself working in business and tech in the long term? And and I know, like business and tech are 2 different fields that have many ways to come together. So in what area of business and tech do you see yourself in.

128
00:14:32.363 --> 00:14:34.170
Ankur Shah: Cybersecurity and

129
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.190
Ankur Shah: or something. Data. Science.

130
00:14:36.464 --> 00:14:55.280
Ankur Shah: I mean, AI is everywhere now. So that's my husband. Just started a company like literally right now. So I think he's seeing that kind of develop, you know. So it's kind of exciting, you know. So he's I mean, literally like a month ago, he's starting got funded and all that. So he's kind of seeing that process cause he tells us about it, and stuff, you know. So it kind of.

131
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.130
Jenny Duan: Congratulations, super cool.

132
00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.890
Ankur Shah: I think he's getting excited about that.

133
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:06.919
Jenny Duan: Yeah, Arian, quick question. So when you're on the top cover of Times magazine in 20 years, what's the cover? Gonna say.

134
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:25.810
Jenny Duan: It could be anything it could be. It could be, you know, world's record longest longest time playing video games. It could be, you know, travel to the most countries, it could be started. New 1 billion dollar startup like, what's it? Gonna say, it could be anything.

135
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.754
Ankur Shah: Future. CEO. Maybe.

136
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.320
Jenny Duan: Your CEO. What what are you gonna be doing?

137
00:15:34.197 --> 00:15:38.220
Ankur Shah: Same thing in like computer science, business, cyber security.

138
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:44.249
Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, future. CEO, computer science business cyber security. What's your company? Gonna do.

139
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.510
Ankur Shah: It's gonna

140
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.310
Ankur Shah: What is that gonna secure? Protect people from like cyber attacks?

141
00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:13.349
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, super important, super important. Cyber attacks are, gonna you know, be more and more prevalent, especially when it comes to like se national security like personal security, especially, maybe it does like personal data protection on social media. Or you know, something like that. That's super cool. So now I want you to think about yourself in 20 years, and

142
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:35.919
Jenny Duan: the reason why we're doing this call right now is to set yourself up on the path to get you there, and I know you're already taking the classes that you need to be doing to, you know. Prepare yourself academically. But, the reason why we're doing this, and the reason why all of the hard work that you're gonna put in now and over the next 4 years is to set you on that track to one day. Be on that cover of Times magazine.

143
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:58.999
Jenny Duan: So that's why, you know, it's really important to put time into extra curriculars to put time into school, and I want you to have this goal in mind, because I know that sometimes the college application process can feel like you're just putting yourself into the void like you're doing something for no reason. And you know, like, why am I taking these prep classes like, why am I? Why am I sitting here on this call when I could be like outside played basketball with my friends

144
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:24.339
Jenny Duan: like, why am I even doing this? This is why you're doing this so that you can set yourself up with the knowledge and the personal character in the preparation to get you to where you want to be in that 20 years. So just remember this like everything that you do. It's for a reason you're not doing it for no reason. Because I think that's a narrative that a lot of students, and that's something that I even thought when I was a little bit younger, that I didn't realize that everything that I was doing had purpose. But for you I want you to

145
00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:36.640
Jenny Duan: approach school and tennis and everything else with that sense of purpose. So okay, you're interested in business and technology. We know that. What else are you interested in? What else do you spend time doing? I know you do tennis. What else do you do?

146
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.880
Ankur Shah: I mean, I

147
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.110
Ankur Shah: play sports for fun. And

148
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.960
Ankur Shah: I play video games.

149
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.000
Ankur Shah: yeah.

150
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.489
Jenny Duan: What, what sports, what sports do you play in? What video games.

151
00:17:54.342 --> 00:17:57.650
Ankur Shah: Sports for fun, I mean basketball, football.

152
00:17:58.796 --> 00:18:01.230
Ankur Shah: and tennis for fun. Sometimes.

153
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.690
Jenny Duan: Hmm.

154
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.459
Jenny Duan: and what about video games?

155
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.929
Ankur Shah: I play. Cs go sometimes.

156
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:39.199
Jenny Duan: This goes cool. Also, I wanna emphasize like, it's not a bad thing to play video games like nothing that you do is is inherently bad. What's bad is, you know. Maybe you spend too much time playing video games. That could be a problem. But playing video games in and of itself isn't a problem. So I want you to feel comfortable like you can share that also, like right now, I don't know if I told you this. But I'm studying abroad in China, and I'm literally gonna go with my school, my my academic professor, to go watch

157
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:47.299
Jenny Duan: like the League of Legends like Asia championships in a couple of weeks. So I think there's nothing wrong with playing video games. My professor at school

158
00:18:47.300 --> 00:19:11.789
Jenny Duan: at Stanford loves video games, and he's taking a group of us to go see the League of Legends, Asia championships. So there's nothing wrong with with saying that you like video games. It's I mean, the only thing is, if you spend too much time playing video games, and if that affects other things. But if you just play video games like that's fine. I want you to feel comfortable sharing that. So you play Cs, go super cool basketball, football tennis. How long does tennis training take you every week. I'm curious.

159
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.810
Jenny Duan: I know this can be super intense.

160
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.929
Ankur Shah: So

161
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.099
Ankur Shah: practice that our school is

162
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.670
Ankur Shah: every day for the most part for 2 h.

163
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.539
Ankur Shah: and then out of school.

164
00:19:24.221 --> 00:19:30.509
Ankur Shah: I actually don't really do out of school anymore since the season started. But that would have been

165
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.549
Ankur Shah: maybe 4 HA week.

166
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:40.150
Jenny Duan: Got it. So you're currently in season during the off seasons. Do you play football and basketball at school, too, or no?

167
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.160
Ankur Shah: No, that that's just for fun.

168
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:43.870
Jenny Duan: Okay, gotcha

169
00:19:44.362 --> 00:19:47.750
Jenny Duan: so during the off season, do you take outside lessons for tennis?

170
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.380
Ankur Shah: Yeah, I did.

171
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:50.890
Jenny Duan: Okay.

172
00:19:51.170 --> 00:20:04.499
Jenny Duan: okay? So you do tennis? You do investment club. And you do. Deca, are you involved in anything else like volunteering? Do you have, like anything else that you spend your time doing outside of school, and and all this thing that you mentioned earlier.

173
00:20:05.489 --> 00:20:11.000
Ankur Shah: Our school has like mandatory volunteering. So I do that sometimes.

174
00:20:11.383 --> 00:20:13.250
Ankur Shah: I'll see the kitchen locally.

175
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.429
Jenny Duan: anything else.

176
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.819
Jenny Duan: Could be. Anything, could be anything

177
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:24.260
Jenny Duan: academic or not?

178
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.309
Ankur Shah: For volunteering, you're saying, or for any.

179
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.400
Jenny Duan: Or no, just in general, just in general.

180
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:31.950
Ankur Shah: Think that's it?

181
00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.080
Ankur Shah: Probably.

182
00:20:34.790 --> 00:21:03.100
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Yeah. Seems pretty balanced for a freshman. So what we're gonna do now is I wanna take some time and strategize about what other types of activities you might find interesting. Or you might wanna explore in the next couple of years on the common application. There's space to list up to 10 different activities. And what that means is, typically, people have a balance of academic related activities. So that would be your pre professional things like Deca or Investment Club.

183
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:21.450
Jenny Duan: but people also like to spend their time volunteering and showing a good mix of you know their extracurricular commitments, pre professional interest and also their community service and their impact. So it's good that you already have little buds of each one. But we're gonna think about and strategize how you can maybe expand this moving forwards.

184
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.370
Jenny Duan: So

185
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.880
Jenny Duan: with Investment Club and Decca, I'm curious like.

186
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:36.650
Jenny Duan: are you? How are you situated in this club? And do you feel like you would have the opportunity to take leadership positions moving forward, maybe in your junior year or your senior year.

187
00:21:37.801 --> 00:21:40.109
Ankur Shah: Yeah, hopefully, I can become

188
00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.029
Ankur Shah: deck officer or a mentor.

189
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.339
Ankur Shah: I think, becoming the it's hard. So that's probably not gonna happen. But

190
00:21:48.728 --> 00:21:51.859
Ankur Shah: becoming an officer is something I wanna do.

191
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.170
Jenny Duan: Yeah. And that's something that you run for at the statewide level.

192
00:21:57.076 --> 00:21:58.380
Ankur Shah: No! It's just no.

193
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.549
Jenny Duan: Just so in the club. Okay, got it?

194
00:22:01.412 --> 00:22:03.740
Jenny Duan: And I'm curious like.

195
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.680
Jenny Duan: how are you perceived at school by your peers? Do you think

196
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:13.939
Jenny Duan: it's a random question. Do you feel like you've come off as more shy? It's more talkative. Are you the class clown? How do you think your peers perceive you.

197
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.619
Ankur Shah: Probably more shy.

198
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:28.279
Jenny Duan: More shy. Got it? And is this something that you're comfortable with like? Do you like being shy? Do you want to be more outgoing. Do you like being more reserved? You like? What? What do you? Where do you want to grow? In what direction.

199
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.520
Ankur Shah: Maybe more

200
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.803
Ankur Shah: outgoing. So

201
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.599
Ankur Shah: I can get more leadership opportunities.

202
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:41.190
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. What do you feel like is is stopping you from being more outgoing right now.

203
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.360
Ankur Shah: I I just don't want to. Most of the.

204
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.479
Jenny Duan: She doesn't want to.

205
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.148
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense.

206
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.769
Jenny Duan: there's a period of time in my life where I was, where I was also really shy. I think I just wasn't like

207
00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:10.459
Jenny Duan: when I was in eighth grade and ninth grade. I think I just wasn't comfortable with putting myself out there, and I was always like really wanting to stay in my bubble with all of my friends, because that's just like the people that I knew my whole life. But I definitely remember feeling that way, too, in my life.

208
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:19.989
Jenny Duan: I'm curious how how your relationship with your teachers is. Do you feel like you know them pretty well. Do you not really know them like, how how close are you with your teachers?

209
00:23:21.176 --> 00:23:22.859
Ankur Shah: I think I'm close with

210
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.980
Ankur Shah: maybe 3 teachers.

211
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.289
Jenny Duan: Yeah, which teachers are those.

212
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.099
Ankur Shah: English and business teacher.

213
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:51.560
Jenny Duan: Cool. I would say. Try to keep your relationships with your teachers as close as possible. Like. Go to office hours, feel free to ask them for help, because there, first of all, they're really there to support you. But second, of all, teacher relationships are really important to you for letters, recommendation and for other programs down the line. I also feel like

214
00:23:51.560 --> 00:24:05.516
Jenny Duan: everything that I'm telling you. When it comes to college application. So I'm saying, teacher relationships are important for your letters of recommendation. But all of these tips are not only for college, it's also for just life and preparing as a person, because ultimately.

215
00:24:06.096 --> 00:24:28.750
Jenny Duan: college preparation is not ultimately just about getting into a good school. It's about like developing as a person. So when I say these things. I don't want it to seem like you're doing everything just again to college. It's really to help you grow as a person and like getting into college is a byproduct of that, but not the root purpose of, you know, investing your time into relationships with teachers, investing your time into activities and everything like that.

216
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.619
Jenny Duan: So just wanna clarify that a little bit. But

217
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.550
Jenny Duan: yeah, relationships with teachers is important for life, but also for your recommendations.

218
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.540
Jenny Duan: Okay, so

219
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:46.089
Jenny Duan: Investment Club. Decca, I'm curious. Are you planning to major in business in the future? Is this something that you're thinking about doing.

220
00:24:47.423 --> 00:24:48.569
Ankur Shah: Maybe, but

221
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.669
Ankur Shah: probably one of major computer science.

222
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:58.840
Jenny Duan: Sure. Yeah, can you tell me why computer science stands out to you? Why is this interesting to you? To major in.

223
00:25:00.436 --> 00:25:04.829
Ankur Shah: Cause. That's the field. I wanna go in computer science cyber security.

224
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:06.456
Jenny Duan: Got it.

225
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.740
Jenny Duan: So do you see yourself more on the tech side than rather than the business side?

226
00:25:11.596 --> 00:25:16.499
Ankur Shah: I I like business more. But I think I'm probably gonna do something with tech.

227
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.509
Jenny Duan: Why is that? Why is that.

228
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.010
Ankur Shah: I mean.

229
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:26.649
Ankur Shah: maybe I can do something with a combination of both.

230
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.149
Ankur Shah: But that's what I wanted to do.

231
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.180
Jenny Duan: Okay, got it?

232
00:25:30.593 --> 00:25:43.810
Jenny Duan: So I'm just. I am curious, though. You say you'd like business more. But you want to do tech. Is that? Because tech is more stable? Is that because, like what? I'm curious? Why, you think that there's no wrong answer. I'm just curious.

233
00:25:44.783 --> 00:25:47.849
Ankur Shah: Cause. There's like a clear path with tech.

234
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.586
Ankur Shah: To what

235
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.290
Ankur Shah: For the feature?

236
00:25:53.260 --> 00:26:04.790
Jenny Duan: That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, I think in the future, everything is gonna involve some type of technology, right? Whether you're in business whether you're in medicine, whether you're in law or anything else. Tech is going to be a part of it so smart that you're thinking ahead.

237
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:16.279
Jenny Duan: So it seems like you're interested in tech. But you don't really do anything related to tech. I'm curious if there's a computer science club at your school, and if so like. Why, you've chosen not to be in that.

238
00:26:17.508 --> 00:26:23.599
Ankur Shah: I actually did go to. I forgot to mention. I went to a Cyber Security club last semester

239
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.840
Ankur Shah: and there's just not a lot of computer science and tech programs after school.

240
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.759
Ankur Shah: Not a lot of major clubs

241
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.920
Ankur Shah: that do that.

242
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.369
Jenny Duan: Hmm! What's stopping you from starting your own.

243
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:45.589
Ankur Shah: I was thinking about doing that next year. They don't let freshmen start clubs. But yeah.

244
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.810
Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead. Yeah.

245
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.340
Jenny Duan: So I think it'd be super cool if you started your own club. What do you think.

246
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.250
Ankur Shah: Yeah, I think that's something I'd wanna do.

247
00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.070
Jenny Duan: Yeah, what type of club do you think you would start.

248
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.709
Ankur Shah: That like I really have no idea. But

249
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:03.880
Ankur Shah: maybe.

250
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:11.550
Jenny Duan: We can spend some time like thinking about that together right now. So you mentioned there's a Cyber Security Club at your school. What other types of Cs clubs are there.

251
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.785
Ankur Shah: is robotics, right? There's for oh, yeah, robotics.

252
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.320
Ankur Shah: there's some smaller ones.

253
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.620
Ankur Shah: This is some Matt Rover. I don't know that very well, either. I mean, we just kind of yeah.

254
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:34.137
Ankur Shah: cause my daughter was very liberal artsy, so kind of very did much of that. So I don't know too much on this side. But

255
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:41.035
Ankur Shah: and there's a few I just have to kind of look into it to see exactly what's offered for next year.

256
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.020
Ankur Shah: What is that? Frc, what is that?

257
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.249
Jenny Duan: Oh, at first! See robotics.

258
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.090
Ankur Shah: Okay.

259
00:27:47.210 --> 00:28:08.940
Ankur Shah: yeah. I mean, I that's the thing I mean, just, you know, just really quick is what he hasn't done too much like program. Of course he does it in computer science. But he doesn't tend to with programming. But you know, we're in Bay area. So tech is just kind of top of mind all the time, right? But I think he's interested in business. But he does. Wanna intersect that with tech at some point, just because he feels like.

260
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:21.003
Ankur Shah: you know, to be honest, that's where he's gonna make money. That's where he's gonna be successful. That's where that's what I think. He I he could say something different. But that's why I think that everybody kind of goes through since the big area kind of mindset, you know.

261
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.900
Jenny Duan: Hmm.

262
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:28.309
Ankur Shah: But yeah, I think if you can figure out a good club that intersects both of those that would be kind of cool. Yeah.

263
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:39.449
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's super cool. So one thing that I'm thinking about is actually have you heard of like Cs for social good, or C tech for good types of nonprofits or clubs.

264
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.310
Ankur Shah: I don't think I've heard of that.

265
00:28:42.620 --> 00:29:08.710
Jenny Duan: So one thing that could be a really good approach is for you to work with small businesses or nonprofits, and actually create like websites or apps for these businesses, and that would combine your passion for business and technology because you would able, you'd be able to support, like a small business, a nonprofit, a local initiative by helping them create a solution like a website or an app or a platform to really showcase and demonstrate and grow their work.

266
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:13.190
Jenny Duan: And I think that would teach you a lot about business because you'd be working with so many businesses.

267
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:19.249
Jenny Duan: But you would also learn about technology and Cs, because you would be building like tech solutions for them, and

268
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:40.729
Jenny Duan: even better if you did it for free, or if you worked with like nonprofits that could also demonstrate, like your commitment to your community and community service. If you wanted, you could narrow this in further like. For example, if you wanted to work with businesses of a certain type. You could do that, or if you wanted to work with nonprofits of a certain type, or def a certain like demographic or interest area, you could narrow it down.

269
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:54.089
Jenny Duan: But using that as a framework, I feel like that could be a really cool way for you to not only gain some hands on projects, building actual things, but also like being able to support and learn about businesses, too. Is this something that you would find interesting.

270
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:55.690
Ankur Shah: Yeah.

271
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:10.749
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I feel like that. Seems like a pretty good like idea, like within the club, you could, you could have different teams of maybe like 5 to 10 people in your club working with individual businesses. And you could you could lead like

272
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:29.540
Jenny Duan: a team, or you could be like you could oversee all of the different teams, and that would also help you develop a leadership leadership skills by like coordinating all these different, you know, student to business partnerships, and it could be like you could call it whatever you want. Who could call it? Some people call it like Cs for social good. Some people call it like

273
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:40.660
Jenny Duan: hacking for good, you could, you know, give it whatever type of name you want. But I feel like that would be a really good way to integrate community service, leadership, business and technology all in one opportunity.

274
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.289
Jenny Duan: I think it's like that's.

275
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:43.779
Ankur Shah: Good, happy.

276
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.460
Jenny Duan: And okay.

277
00:30:44.460 --> 00:31:00.459
Ankur Shah: Last choice called something about social innovation. I don't know. I mean, I'd have to look at his catalog for next year, but some of those are like entrepreneurship for, like nonprofit kind of stuff or impact. Or I mean, those are just classes. I don't. They're not clubs, but.

278
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:21.499
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think that it OP opens an opportunity for you to attract people who maybe don't have space in their schedule to take those classes who want to do something like that, or people who have already taken those classes and want to continue so. It seems like even if there's overlap, I feel like you can use that overlap to your advantage by like engaging the people who are interested in those classes into your club.

279
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.380
Jenny Duan: Hmm.

280
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:35.270
Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm also curious with the Investment Club. How does that club work? Are you doing like, are you learning about investments? Are you actively investing. What kinds of things do you do in that club?

281
00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:41.980
Ankur Shah: It's a it's a smaller club that's student ran seniors

282
00:31:42.902 --> 00:31:47.049
Ankur Shah: so they they teach investing sometimes.

283
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.920
Ankur Shah: and they teach how to invest, and I did try to invest a bit last semester.

284
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.426
Ankur Shah: I tried it off for a bit.

285
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:04.179
Jenny Duan: Cool. So a couple of questions here, first of all, are the seniors graduating and

286
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:14.059
Jenny Duan: and do they when they graduate? Who's gonna take leadership? Can you take leadership? Second of all, where? What money are you investing with? And

287
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:15.949
Jenny Duan: yeah, how does that work.

288
00:32:16.942 --> 00:32:21.630
Ankur Shah: So the seniors, actually, they haven't even showed up in a few months. So.

289
00:32:21.965 --> 00:32:22.300
Jenny Duan: Wow!

290
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.290
Ankur Shah: Question is taking over right now.

291
00:32:25.568 --> 00:32:28.680
Ankur Shah: She's taking over as the president

292
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.189
Ankur Shah: and I'm investing right now.

293
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.600
Ankur Shah: Actually, I'm not. I'm not really investing right now.

294
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.001
Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. So

295
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:59.639
Jenny Duan: I think you should take this opportunity to also take leadership as a co-president advice President, or some other officer role. Seems like if another freshmen stepping up like you could do the same too. So why don't you coordinate with this person and see what you can do together to transform this club. Second thing is to give this club structure. I think you guys should look into the stock market game. Have you heard about this.

296
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.050
Ankur Shah: Bye.

297
00:33:02.362 --> 00:33:05.390
Jenny Duan: Do you have a club that does the stock market game? Simulation.

298
00:33:06.686 --> 00:33:10.429
Ankur Shah: Yeah, deca there's an option to do that

299
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.140
Ankur Shah: within the December.

300
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.010
Jenny Duan: You gave.

301
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.235
Jenny Duan: Okay?

302
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:21.289
Jenny Duan: that's that's interesting. I feel like the stock market game would also fit well in the In Confessment club scope.

303
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.920
Jenny Duan: But maybe there's is there a lot of overlap between? But Investment Club and Decca.

304
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.750
Ankur Shah: Not not really no

305
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.699
Ankur Shah: cause that doesn't want to. Competitive, you know. They have the competition and investment clubs like

306
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.840
Ankur Shah: a really small club.

307
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.840
Ankur Shah: Compared to Decca.

308
00:33:37.640 --> 00:34:07.369
Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So what I see here is, it's a small club which means you are a freshman. You have the opportunity to take leadership in this club and completely transform it. So that would be really cool if you would be able to grow this club by like a lot by the end of your graduation time. Because also another thing that, like most college applications and every application looks for is they wanna see metrics. And so if you're actually starting with the small club that is actually gonna be a benefit because you can show more growth

309
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:33.239
Jenny Duan: for a bigger club already with 100 members. It's hard to show like (102) 030-4050% growth. But if you're a small club and you only have like 5 members, it can be really easy to double even triple quadruple your membership if you're able to do a good job as a leader. So I feel like this is a really good opportunity for you to actually demonstrate your growth over time and like the growth of this organization as well. So I feel like you should take this opportunity to keep on growing your club

310
00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.309
Jenny Duan: and try to pick up a leadership role as well.

311
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.949
Jenny Duan: Bond

312
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:44.859
Jenny Duan: cool. So the other thing that I want to spend some time talking about is community service and impact.

313
00:34:44.870 --> 00:35:04.540
Jenny Duan: So I think that this is like a very undervalued area and understated for a lot of students and most students typically have, like a passion or an area that they feel like they can make a big contribution or impact in. And I'm curious like, is there anything any like areas that stand out to you as areas that you'd be interested in contributing to.

314
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.810
Ankur Shah: To community service.

315
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.729
Ankur Shah: like, I was saying earlier, there's a soup kitchen

316
00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.909
Ankur Shah: that I volunteer a lot

317
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.670
Ankur Shah: so maybe I could do that

318
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.930
Ankur Shah: often.

319
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:39.518
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think that the here thing here is we wanna emphasize that it's not just service. It's not just about being a body there and giving a number of hours. It's about trying to make an impact in some area or some cause in the world. So if we were to take the soup kitchen as an example. The cause that you would be focused on highlighting is maybe

320
00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.400
Jenny Duan: is maybe

321
00:35:41.820 --> 00:36:03.729
Jenny Duan: poverty, alleviation, or hunger, so that would be like the bigger issue that you're trying to solve, and that maybe would extend beyond the soup kitchens that would maybe extend to changing and affecting policy in your area and becoming a leader in other ways. But for you, I'm curious like, is there an area that you're passionate about like this? And the reason why we bring this up is because.

322
00:36:04.076 --> 00:36:15.150
Jenny Duan: a lot of students, I think, from similar backgrounds to you are maybe labeled as Cookie Cutter profiles, or they are a little bit stereotyped within the college application process like.

323
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:42.589
Jenny Duan: let's be honest like you are an Indian male who's wants to study Cs from the Bay Area. There's many, many students with the same profile as you, who maybe spend hours volunteering at the soup kitchen, who do business, who are interested in all these areas. And that's not a bad thing. But what we wanna do is really make your profile and make you stand out by highlighting what's unique about you. And that could be anything that could be something like, you're really good at tennis. That could be. You have an impact in a very specific area. But

324
00:36:42.800 --> 00:37:05.389
Jenny Duan: the reason why we're trying to talk about all of this is because it's really really important for you to do things that make you stand out, because the truth is, you will probably be faced with many people with the same background, and when faced with a profile of other people, with same Gpa, same demographics, same major interest. We wanna have something unique about you that the admissions officers can hold on to and help you stand out. Siraj. Yes. Did you have something to say?

325
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:16.519
Ivylevel: Yeah, I think it's a very important point that if if you don't mind, I wanted to kind of chime in as well, because, you know, I think it's a very related point. And the reason why, you know, we had actually hand picked

326
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.610
Ivylevel: Rishi. And you know you don't have to come on board.

327
00:37:19.938 --> 00:37:29.019
Ivylevel: So I think the point that Jenny's highlighting is critically important. You know both Lina and we had been discussing about this right. What we are trying to do here. All every effort that's going in here

328
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:50.449
Ivylevel: is really not about just following. You know the the herd here right? And I think that's very stressful. And I know that your parents have actually gone through this journey already once, and I'm I'm I myself. I'm a victim. I'm I'm I've sent my older daughter to crimson, and then had to work out of it, and all that stuff. The thing we want to do is right early on. We want to identify

329
00:37:50.480 --> 00:38:06.670
Ivylevel: how to make you really unique and stand out. And you are unique already in too many things that you've already said. And you have an example here, Rishi, right? And I want, you know, this is so Rishi basically is now AI machine learning software art.

330
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:23.020
Ivylevel: Stanford. And when you know a again, like when I when you look at his story, and and this is something that he got in his admission letter after he got admitted. I mean, they all go to like Stanford. They get a note from the admission officer as to like, why did they choose Rishi? What did really stand out.

331
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:39.730
Ivylevel: It's his community and service impact right? And not in a bad way, you know, like a lot of people have asked me, sir. I see in your website that people with 3.8 Gpa can actually make it to Stanford. I mean, Rishi is here, and there are many of the students who have done that. You don't need to be like, you know, all is right, and this is with proof.

332
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:57.830
Ivylevel: And the reason. Just look at the way this, I mean, this is, I mean, when I looked at this, I said, Hey, you're an AI machine learning guy, right? Like, I don't see any technology in your Passion project or any community project. There's no single line of code. It's all like what they've done is they've actually procured all the waste kind of devices that all of us have in the house.

333
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:14.099
Ivylevel: Yeah, on ebay. And Rishi bought them with his team, built a team. They repaired it. And they basically generated nonprofit revenue out of it at a profit. And then, basically, you know, gave it to the nonprofit organization, apparently like more than 27,000 etc. But, more importantly.

334
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:32.129
Ivylevel: the way it also that tied into the narrative of reducing e waste, and also working towards the advocacy of actually enabling a right to repair something that probably Apple would not like. I'm sure you know as an apple care like, you know, they don't want like a do your own repair kind of a thing. I want to show you the impact here. Right?

335
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:48.359
Ivylevel: This is what I really talk. Tell to people that you know it's. And and this is all, not just a perspective. This is hardcore data. And I wanted to highlight this. And this is what we are trying to do from early on. It's not about the quantity of checklist items the cookie got to profile that Jenny's talking about.

336
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:59.749
Ivylevel: We have so many, I can tell you that we have so many profiles, and we make this running joke internally, like, you know. Hey? I really feel to ask the student, why haven't you found the cure to cancer yet?

337
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:16.609
Ivylevel: Trust me, there are profiles unbelievable. But I think this is where we are. We are. We are trying to drive this conversation towards and what we want to help you with. So yeah, I just wanted to kind of chime in here for us for a sec yeah, sorry, Jenny. I'll just let you kind of you know. Take it from there.

338
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:33.389
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So anyways, continuing from that, that's kind of why we're asking all of these questions, to try to get to know you and try to identify what's unique about you and about your interest so that we can help craft that better. So yeah, curious about

339
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:53.489
Jenny Duan: this community impact area that you're passionate about. Do you feel like there's anything that stands out to you? So some people like to work on education. Some people like to do healthcare. Some people like to focus on the right to repair electronics like, is there any small area that you're interested in? Perhaps making a difference in one day.

340
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.559
Jenny Duan: If not, that's also okay. But just curious.

341
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.840
Ankur Shah: With the soup kitchen. I'm not not really interested in that.

342
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.059
Ankur Shah: I just do it, cause I have to.

343
00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.150
Jenny Duan: Oh!

344
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.200
Ankur Shah: I mean, I haven't explored many other

345
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.660
Ankur Shah: community service.

346
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.809
Ankur Shah: things so

347
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.129
Ankur Shah: right now, I'm not really interested in anything.

348
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:37.020
Jenny Duan: Yeah, makes sense. I feel like soup kitchen, just because you have to like that totally makes sense. No one, you know, wakes up, and it's like my dream necessarily is to work in the soup kitchen and like that's what I want to do every day, like I think maybe some people do. But I feel like for the vast majority of people. That's probably not the case.

349
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:52.797
Jenny Duan: But I think that something that I think is really interesting, personally at least, is, have you ever thought about like social media privacy and like online privacy cause? I feel like this is an emergent area that requires a lot of attention. But I feel like there's not a lot of people working on these issues

350
00:41:53.090 --> 00:42:05.330
Jenny Duan: in the field of social media and other forms of like digital privacy. Is this something that you might be interested in like advocating? For to some level or no, it's. And it's totally okay, if not too.

351
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.747
Ankur Shah: Maybe I'm just not sure what I would do with it.

352
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:24.970
Jenny Duan: Yeah, so people typically would tackle this project in different ways. So maybe like working on legislation to help moderate like trust and safety or cyber security in terms of like data sharing on social media.

353
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:31.030
Jenny Duan: also ensuring that, like, the algorithms are fair and like, are able to take down harmful content.

354
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:36.044
Jenny Duan: That could be something interesting.

355
00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:50.439
Jenny Duan: another interesting area. And like, obviously, you don't have to know what you want to do right now. These are just some ideas that I'm throwing at you that you could think about. And you can think about over the next couple of months. What you want to spend a lot of your high school experience working on.

356
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:58.559
Jenny Duan: There's also like video games and like mental health and safety. I think this is a big area, especially for young teenagers.

357
00:42:58.915 --> 00:43:10.310
Jenny Duan: Like video games. Obviously, we know, can be pretty harmful to creating violence or encouraging violence in children. So maybe that's an area you could think about, too. Do you have any thoughts on that?

358
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:12.520
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

359
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:20.749
Ankur Shah: Yeah, I think I mean, this may be something where you may have to list a few things, and you can kind of think about it. Honestly, he's just not. I mean, you know.

360
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:28.680
Ankur Shah: I'm sure he does think about stuff, but it's just with school and everything else. It's just. But this is good because it gives him

361
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:34.719
Ankur Shah: kind of a direction which is what we're looking for, right cause. It's even hard for us to kind of figure out what he

362
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:41.738
Ankur Shah: kind of can. And sometimes you don't know what you're going to impact until you actually start doing it, you know. So he's trying to figure

363
00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.670
Ankur Shah: and.

364
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:44.560
Jenny Duan: Percent.

365
00:43:45.012 --> 00:43:52.337
Jenny Duan: Also, another thing is like using sports as a way to teach life skills. You mentioned earlier that, like yours, you're

366
00:43:52.670 --> 00:44:18.340
Jenny Duan: your city in San Jose or your area doesn't necessarily have access to the best public education, and maybe, like alongside that comes with like a mis preparedness in terms of life skills like leadership, organization and other things. And so maybe sports can be a great way to teach that. For example, like tennis. If you need to practice 2 HA day. That means you need to organize your schedule around tennis. That means you need to be a leader on the core. That means you need to balance school practice life. And so

367
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:33.530
Jenny Duan: maybe you could start a program where you teach young people like live skills through sports. Maybe in these like different underserved areas. So that's another idea for you. Do you have any thoughts on that? One like you don't have to say, if you like it or not, just like, do you have any thoughts on it?

368
00:44:34.608 --> 00:44:37.800
Ankur Shah: I I might be interested in coaching Dennis

369
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.959
Ankur Shah: in the future.

370
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:49.578
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's super cool. And then another thing is like another. So we went over 3 ideas. So far, we went over social media and like regulations and safety. We also went over

371
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:55.379
Jenny Duan: video games and mental health. We went over sports and leadership. Another final idea for you and

372
00:44:55.679 --> 00:45:11.869
Jenny Duan: these are just ideas. Again, you don't have to follow these. Just think about them. It's all. Another idea is maybe some type of like nonprofit or startup that uses business to solve a social issue. And I know this is super broad, and we could think about how to integrate that better. But maybe you like

373
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:31.600
Jenny Duan: start a company, and you donate the money to to an organization that you're very passionate about. Maybe you you know, solve other. Some other type of social impact. Area with business. I know some. I know people who actually have done sneaker reselling made a ton of money doing that and like donated all of that to a nonprofit.

374
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:54.519
Jenny Duan: So think big it doesn't have to be. You don't have to be like working in the soup kitchen you could be reselling sneakers, and that could be your passion project, you know, like this. Think big with your ideas, and think about something that is, you truly care about, because at the end of the day you don't wanna waste your time doing things that you don't find valuable, whatever that is. So yeah, I would say, encourage you to think about not only these ideas, but anything else you could come up with.

375
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.838
Jenny Duan: and maybe the next time we meet we can talk about what might be interesting to you.

376
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.900
Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm curious

377
00:46:02.253 --> 00:46:24.596
Jenny Duan: beyond that. So we talked about some of the clubs that school we talked about. Your academic interest. We also talked about your community service impact. I'm curious if you do anything in regards to like your cultural background, or if you do anything cultural. Because one thing is, people think that hiding their background is, gonna make them a more competitive applicant. But I think colleges actually,

378
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:41.010
Jenny Duan: Do you really like to see your involvement with culture and your background? Because they wanna create a holistic and diverse class. And they want students to lead like cultural groups, dance groups, music groups, and all things like that. So do you do anything related to your culture or your background?

379
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:42.524
Ankur Shah: Email.

380
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:55.039
Jenny Duan: No, okay, maybe that's something to think about doing. If you can explore that in in any way. For example, like every school like, has, for example, a South Asian Culture Club, and they have, like

381
00:46:55.340 --> 00:47:22.528
Jenny Duan: groups that do dance that do music that try to contribute to like the diversity on campus, and they want to see students who will come to their institutions and lead those clubs. And so your culture is like a strength for you. It's it's something that adds a lot of value, not only to your life, but like to your college applications. And so I would encourage. Yeah, there's Bollywood dance groups. There's things like that everywhere. Maybe like you're not a dancer. Maybe you are, but it doesn't have to be Bollywood. It could be anything else.

382
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:44.339
Jenny Duan: So if there's anything that you can do to like, showcase your cultural involvement, that would also be really good. What some people like to do is they like to work at cultural related nonprofits in their area. They like to if they're religious volunteer at a temple or mosque some people like to organize like, you know, other activities that are cultural. So anything like that, I would

383
00:47:44.340 --> 00:48:00.309
Jenny Duan: say, like, use this off as an opportunity to not only learn more about your culture, because when you're in college to, you might not have the same opportunity to learn from your parents your grandparents, in the same way that you do right now. So I would say, like, Take this high school as an opportunity to get more involved with that if you can.

384
00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.400
Jenny Duan: And now I'm curious, like

385
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:10.109
Jenny Duan: moving forward. What are your plans for the summer? And do you have any thoughts on what you're gonna spend your summer doing.

386
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.509
Ankur Shah: wasn't there that program?

387
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.089
Ankur Shah: Yeah. So he's applying to a couple of programs, I think.

388
00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:31.541
Ankur Shah: there, by June, something. So I forgot the names of it. But this summer, initially, he was gonna take Kim in the summer.

389
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.270
Jenny Duan: Right.

390
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:52.789
Ankur Shah: Physics right? But then it's not offered at a school anymore. And then his, his school counselor told him that if he takes Kim outside. Then he would not be able to take ap Kim in school. So we kind of, you know, decided not to do that. And then I really, you know, he's taking Calc could be seen, especially if he's gonna take physics because it's like

391
00:48:52.830 --> 00:49:11.199
Ankur Shah: really hard for my daughter this year. She's taking physics. Ap, so I really want him to get some kind of tutoring over the summer, just for, you know, maybe a few hours a week for physics and and calc, if needed, but mostly for physics and and also computer science, because I don't think he's quite there where.

392
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:23.379
Ankur Shah: you know, he's some of the basics. I just don't think he spends enough time on it. Basically, I think he needs to spend more time on certain things just to kind of get better. He's he's quick to pick up, but he's just gotta spend that time on it, you know. So.

393
00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:35.900
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And with computer science, like, what aspect of computer science are you interested in? More? The problem, solving aspect, the aspect of building something like what is what is interesting to you about Cs.

394
00:49:36.792 --> 00:49:38.799
Ankur Shah: Probably building building app.

395
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.450
Jenny Duan: Building.

396
00:49:39.919 --> 00:49:53.909
Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe the summer could be a good time to like pick up some of those web development app development skills, too, especially if you're thinking about starting a club like this, where you will be building apps and other digital things, it could be a good opportunity to learn a little bit more about that.

397
00:49:54.441 --> 00:50:23.749
Jenny Duan: So seems like it's good that you're thinking about the summer. The next time we meet I want to spend some more time. Breaking down your summer and seeing like. If there's another thing that we could start in the summer with regards to your community service impact area, because I think like starting as young as you can is the best, because you have the the most amount of time to build off of extra curriculars. So I wanna spend some more time next time we meet breaking down summer plans, and how? How? You're gonna spend your summer most effectively. So, Raj, did you have something to add.

398
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:43.090
Ivylevel: Yeah. Great, I think. Yeah, in the interest of time. Right? I think this is already like, quite heavily loaded. I hope it's not very overwhelming, Arian, but I think I'm I'm thoroughly enjoying this conversation. There's so many things that come out. It's just the depth of exploring your personality and and your identity and your background. I think that's a few things I wanted to kind of just kind of recap on.

399
00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:45.840
Ivylevel: And and don't worry, you know we'll have more time to

400
00:50:46.279 --> 00:50:59.199
Ivylevel: collaborate over the week. Right? You. Your parents can send more questions over email. And you know we will try to get all that feedback, and even after the report comes it's an evolving document, right? There is. No, there's a certain method of, and this is something I stole from Yana

401
00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:17.479
Ivylevel: the sort of method of doing things there isn't like, you know, a silver bullet that actually, you know, it's a. It's a very opaque system. We all know that. But I think, with our kind of data points and success stories that we have seen, and also, you know, as you were talking you know, in the background we were already looking at your school profile.

402
00:51:17.717 --> 00:51:32.469
Ivylevel: you know. Rishi was kind of digging into it. I basically made a comment, no one to Stanford. And then Rishi basically said that he knew someone from last 2 years ago from Christian Valley who made it to Stanford, their profile. So there's a lot of data work that was happening behind the scene that you're not still aware

403
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:48.080
Ivylevel: what we want to do really, is this right? We work backwards. We want to keep the outcome, because this is the the unfortunate thing, and being a parent of, you know, 3 kids, and have seen, like students struggle through all the heavy work that you're doing. I can totally empathize right? I have a Junior as well, very intense.

404
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:58.680
Ivylevel: So we really want to make it a very stress, free and an enjoyable journey for you. And the way to go about doing that is, by first starting and saying no to things that do not add value to your profile

405
00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:04.639
Ivylevel: like soup. Kitchen is great. But then, again, just applying that lens. And and I want you to ask that question, Arian yourself.

406
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:18.219
Ivylevel: am I doing this just because there's a Su kind of a social pressure. Am I just doing this just because everyone does it? And what I know is that oh, if I do these many voluntary hours, I'll look strong. And that's actually there are a lot of misconceptions. Right?

407
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.580
Ivylevel: It is about your unique identity.

408
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:47.109
Ivylevel: I mean, look at Jana as an example. Right? So I mean if if I mean his, his regime is very intimidating, I don't share it with people right like he's got all these kind of international kind of you know you know us echo ub like he's pretty much nailed every stem kind of award. And then, when I ask, What are you doing these days. You know, at Stanford he's a drummer at Stanford, all crazy personalities and people right? Very different passions and and things of that sort.

409
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:58.530
Ivylevel: what I want to see. Number one is. You know, summer is a very important time now, right? So kind of to conclude one of the key areas that a lot of parents come to us is about summer.

410
00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:06.730
Ivylevel: A very easy way for us, like, and many counselors do is to give you like a big big list. You know, we have more than like 1,000 kind of database kind of hand picked things.

411
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:12.230
Ivylevel: But the way to think about summer is, first, 2 things to kind of keep it separate. Right?

412
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:24.170
Ivylevel: There is an upscaling path. There are thousands and tons of programs that actually help you learn things. Nothing against that right? You can go to a boot camp. And you can learn computer science.

413
00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:34.130
Ivylevel: This is something that Jenny can. What we witness last year. Remember, Jenny, like everyone, came up with one summer program. Can you tell me the name, Jenny, like, you know? It was that.

414
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:35.470
Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's pretty.

415
00:53:35.470 --> 00:54:05.290
Ivylevel: AI right when we ask them the question that what do you think was one of the standout activities this summer in spirit? AI in spirit. AI, how can it be? And in spirit, AI like to your mom's point. Right? Typical kind of bay area tech profile. And everyone goes after that what we want to do is we want to really avoid. So keep your upskilling on one side. And definitely, as you mom said, you know, spend time on tutoring. Learn things, hone your skills. And to be honest in all honesty, like, you know, there is no better platform than Youtube today out there

416
00:54:05.644 --> 00:54:13.750
Ivylevel: which has all these kind of amazing resources. Right? What we want to do, however, is leverage your summer, like many other many other students

417
00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:32.910
Ivylevel: right who actually are trying to use this time to actually have this, their passion project, their passion areas in the community impact areas. Really, like, you know, accelerate that work like Rishi as an example like the what that you see in the news article is something that you started. When did you start that Rishi? That community project. Was it like a freshman or sophomore year?

418
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:34.790
Rishi Padmanabhan: Freshman, year.

419
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:57.199
Ivylevel: Fresh one year. Right? So if you think about it because they they look at 2 aspects of it. Are you authentic, genuinely passionate about a particular passion area. There are 2 metrics around it. One is the commitment of tenure is very important. Because, are you really someone who's actually spent a lot of time and effort on it for a long period of time? Or was this something that you just did for checklists and college applications towards the end.

420
00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:19.600
Ivylevel: plus the depth of it, is also important, right? And that's why you know. Jenny asked, are you a builder profile? Or are you more like a research profile. If you were more like a research kind of a profile might be, we would have thought about some research papers and stuff like that, you know, some of our middle schools are actually working on research papers as well. Right? So so I think the way I want you to think about summer is like, you know, what can I do to also enjoy the journey.

421
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:31.480
Ivylevel: but also build some track record behind the scene, and our team will do that right. We'll try to offload that from you and make sure that every effort that you spend is also leaving a trail that will actually help you eventually

422
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:54.280
Ivylevel: that your parents know already by like, you know, the 10 extra curricular activity list that has. Then we need to quantify your impact. And things like that. Right? So so I want you to think very clearly that because I have wasted tons of time and effort and money on these summer sessions and upscaling programs. I don't want you or your parents to fall for that. That is the wrong way of thinking about it. It does not add any value. In fact, all it shows is privilege

423
00:55:54.280 --> 00:56:02.670
Ivylevel: and pay to win, that parents are able to spend money and swipe their card every single time to send. We need to figure out ways where you can actually go to free programs.

424
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:16.889
Ivylevel: right? And something very interesting. And I can tell you, based on and your identity and your background is gonna really be helpful. So I would love to. You know. Go a bit into your Indian roots and try to figure it out. I've seen that with my own daughter.

425
00:56:17.249 --> 00:56:27.120
Ivylevel: you know, and more than happy to share that as well. So yeah, I think a couple of things I wanted to just highlight, because summer is an important time. Lot of parents are coming to us. Same applies to Ap. As well.

426
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:41.910
Ivylevel: I think the most important thing about grades and Ap's is also something I want to highlight here, right? It is about showing them the academic rigor and discipline. Number one, number 2, showing them that you there is an upward trajectory. So if you get my daughter gotta be.

427
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:52.989
Ivylevel: You know she's been working. We flipped it to 100. And this all happened not because, like she freaked out, but I think it does a way of doing it, and we'll pursue that. But I mean, don't worry if you basically get like one or 2 low scores

428
00:56:52.990 --> 00:57:13.619
Ivylevel: and don't just run it just because all your friends are doing 13 apes and supply. They want to maintain the rigor. But we need to be smart about how do we go about strategizing and selecting those Ap's right. So we will work on Ap core selection. We will work on your summer plan. All these things will come out in that report, but I also want you to learn the framework on how to think about these things. That's very important.

429
00:57:13.844 --> 00:57:29.115
Ivylevel: Yeah. And yeah. Finally, I mean, Jana, I mean, I know that sports is actually one of the reason I brought in Jana was because of your sports element, and I knew that there was. Of course, like you know something. I mean, would you like to share something, Yana, that from your story that anything that you have like as a learning that you would.

430
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.559
Yanav Lall: Absolutely. Yeah.

431
00:57:30.620 --> 00:58:00.459
Yanav Lall: Yes, I I played soccer throughout school. I went to the same school from No. Street to twelfth grade, and it was a big part of my life. And you know, a lot of people would like you need to give it up because it doesn't really count too much, unless you know you're representing your country or something. But I just did it for fun, and I continue doing that. And I did speak about it on my application. So I think it's created audience following his passion for tennis, and I think you should continue doing that. But at the same time I think you should be mindful of the relationship that he has with his coaches and whatnot, because.

432
00:58:00.861 --> 00:58:25.219
Yanav Lall: they are the ones that will be giving you a position in the future. And that's why you should be, you know, thinking about how you interact with them at the same time. And but at the same time you should also be mindful of the fact that if you don't see yourself, maybe you know, playing at the extreme the extreme high level, then you should also be focusing on other things. Yeah, you should play tennis. It is an important part of your life, but at the same time don't maybe spend all of your time on it.

433
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:26.550
Ivylevel: Exactly

434
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:55.570
Ivylevel: it is so I just wanted to kind of, though this is. I hope it gives a glimpse on how we approach every student. Really, you know, it's a teamwork that we do. We we bring in many more perspectives. And you know, this is just the beginning and hopefully during the week, so feel free to send us as many as questions as possible. Lina and uncle, everyone else, and I mean, we'll try to really come up with the draft in the next session. I I think, for now I I do have like, you know, we have discussed. And I think Rishi and Jana are kind of top of our mind as as kind of the main coaches

435
00:58:55.908 --> 00:59:04.779
Ivylevel: for and we're gonna figure out again. You know. Both have a data science and Cs, and the other thing about Cs, I want to be very clear also. Right?

436
00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:15.809
Ivylevel: Ccs major like, you know, Jenny is Cs, but she's Cs. She's AI. She's psychology. She's philosophy, I think. What we also want to do is maximize your chance of getting into a good college.

437
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.279
Ivylevel: and the way to do it is to be smart.

438
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:23.080
Ivylevel: Do not like, you know, problem with Cs is that everyone wants to go into Cs Lane.

439
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:40.710
Ivylevel: And you can ask this like I've asked, like there are probably, I think, 80% of the Cs students today that I've spoken to at Stanford probably did not even come in as Cs. Into Stanford as an example. Even in Berkeley. Right? They come in as like environmental science, and they kind of switch. I think a smarter way to do it is to see where are your Ord less

440
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:47.850
Ivylevel: and data. And there are many beautiful programs that are coming up. So I think, like you said business and combining Cs

441
00:59:47.920 --> 01:00:11.859
Ivylevel: and the courses that both Jenny or Jana or Rishi take. They did much, many, many. You don't need a Cs major to learn. Cs is the point you need that don't need like a Cs major to it, because I think the it's. It's a pity that a lot of parents unfortunately, do not understand this. And then they basically go into that lane because they're busy, and I did the same thing. The only 3 majors I knew was Econ

442
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:32.070
Ivylevel: and Cs. And biomed, and I learned my lesson the hard way, and parents do that every single time unconsciously, and then they go through the same bill they they spend in 20 applications, and they apply to every place, and they get rejections. And then finally, they send their kids to some other school right at in Cs, so we wanna be. We will work very, very creatively. We will try to figure out why.

443
01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:47.807
Ivylevel: you know, might be there is some unique comment. And there are amazing programs coming up every other month. Right? Stanford has so many, like 2 2 different variants of data science, data, science and social systems, data, science and Xyz and things like that. Right? So we will work on that and we'll we'll figure out. So

444
01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:48.710
Ivylevel: so yeah.

445
01:00:48.710 --> 01:01:07.439
Ankur Shah: This is a comment, Sarge, and, like everybody else, the the most important thing that I'm looking for is he's in ninth grade, you know he doesn't have as much direction. So I'd like the way that Jenny asked a lot of questions. I think that's important, because sometimes you don't know until you know, you know. So you just have to kind of kind of probe him a little bit, and

446
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:28.597
Ankur Shah: I'm sure even offline. He'll start thinking about different things after each session, you know. So that's mainly what I'm what we're looking for initially, for, sure. And then, of course, how to just package him at some point right? But right now is just to kind of put in some roots so that he can figure it out. So yeah, I appreciate today's session. I appreciate all of you guys. I'm sure he's

447
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:36.789
Ankur Shah: he'll open up a little bit more as he gets to know everybody else, too. He's like once he gets to know you, he's a lot more open, and I think that'll continue as well. So.

448
01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:37.680
Ivylevel: Yeah, and and.

449
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.110
Jenny Duan: The.

450
01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:45.060
Ivylevel: In fact, lot of students today, you know, Lina actually are from that undecided state right? Lot of students.

451
01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:48.180
Ivylevel: And what we want to do is, however, this.

452
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:48.710
Ankur Shah: Yeah.

453
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:53.129
Ivylevel: We are going to keep a very Yeah, thanks, Jenny. If you are, yeah, I'll just take like 2 min.

454
01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:56.459
Jenny Duan: Much. I'm sorry I have to leave a little early. I have to run to class right now, but

455
01:01:56.790 --> 01:02:01.430
Jenny Duan: so nice you feel free to shoot any questions you have at our team and look forward to our next session.

456
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.060
Ankur Shah: Alright. Thank you.

457
01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:12.737
Ivylevel: Thank you, Penny. Yeah. And and I mean, I don't know if you have like 2 min, I just wanted to respond to that particular topic, because that's your initial details and and feel free, Jana. And Rishi to drop off as well.

458
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:19.659
Ivylevel: so yeah, on that particular point. I think lot of 9 graders and even sophomores that we are working with today.

459
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:23.430
Ivylevel: They fall under the category of undecided. That's perfectly fine.

460
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.229
Ivylevel: because and and and the approach we take again

461
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:32.250
Ivylevel: is that being an undecided major student is not.

462
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:59.439
Ivylevel: you know, a bad thing. It's that approach of discovering it. What is bad is actually to not leverage that time, and that work and that activity that aren't you know, iron does, and not build a profile around it. In fact, what colleges look for is curiosity is intellectual curiosity. See eventually the decision, the rubrics that are being employed are you know how curious he is. How interested is he in multiple things, being interested in multiple things is not at all prohibitive. It's great.

463
01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:26.450
Ivylevel: What we want to do is like. We, we have identified Cs, we have identified cyber security. The other thing we have identified is also finance, his investment and business. All these things have been identified. Correct. What we're gonna do is we are gonna make it very tangible activities where he can do, but also make sure it doesn't go waste right? That also adds up to a track record that that basically demonstrates a measurable and quantifiable

464
01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:37.609
Ivylevel: activity versus telling that oh, I was in this constant research mode, and I was just learning, and you know I did. But if you cannot demonstrate that, so we want to make everything demonstrable.

465
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:53.140
Ivylevel: and that demonstrability is where I think it can happen even for a year, right? It doesn't matter so so I think it's just that we are taking kind of a diverse mode at this time, but I think the sooner we try to also converse during sophomore that would be great.

466
01:03:53.476 --> 01:04:10.969
Ivylevel: So so I think we will, we will definitely include all those kind of passion areas. And say, Let's do X, let's do y? Let's see. And then might be he after those activities will be able to say by doing, we really want to do by doing, we want him to drive a conclusion and say, Mom, actually, I'm all for business, I am. And business, Guy. I don't want to do that.

467
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:23.619
Ivylevel: So I I just wanted to clarify. That's our approach as well. Not Don. I didn't want you to feel like oh, that we are trying to converse too fast. I think that's not the goal. But we also want to frame something that you know it has some tangibility to it. If that makes sense.

468
01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.760
Ankur Shah: Yeah, sounds good. So much. Thank you.

469
01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.909
Ivylevel: Cool. Thank you. Anything else from you. Arian. Any questions.

470
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.705
Ankur Shah: No.

471
01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.290
Ivylevel: Did you like it?

472
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.446
Ankur Shah: Yeah, yeah.

473
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:36.215
Ivylevel: Amazing, amazing. Thank you very much.

474
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.959
Ankur Shah: Alright! Thank you so much. Alright! Perfect!

475
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.500
Ivylevel: Thanks, Jana, thanks, Rishi, for joining. Take care bye.
