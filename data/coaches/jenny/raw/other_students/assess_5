00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:23.730
Jenny Duan: Jenny. And today I'm going to be walking you through. How I think about doing a recap for a student's profile assessment. So today we're going to be looking at Heba's profile. I spoke to Heba a couple weeks ago. During the session I took notes on some things that she was interested in. And today we're going to be filling out the rest of it. Which is the notes after the call.

2
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:48.940
Jenny Duan: So how I typically think about this is 1st looking at the student and their profile. So right now Hiba is a freshman, so she still has some more time. She's interested in track and field, and she doesn't have a very extensive extracurricular profile so far. So we're going to be thinking about her narrative and why it works. And starting from

3
00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:09.000
Jenny Duan: the target narrative key weak spots, immediate opportunities, academic strategy, college test and coaching plan. So typically for students, I kind of like to start out with the coaching plan. Suggestion. Because he was only a freshman, I would say 5 weekly meetings for

4
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:19.849
Jenny Duan: the 1st 2 years, and then weekly meetings during Junior year 2 x or more during

5
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.099
Jenny Duan: application season, which is senior year.

6
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.559
Jenny Duan: And that's the typical cadence.

7
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:44.910
Jenny Duan: suggested test prep, so target score, the goal should always be 1,500 plus for T. 30 to T. 20 schools and 1570 plus for Iv.

8
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.090
Jenny Duan: Ivy League

9
00:01:48.040 --> 00:02:00.580
Jenny Duan: hypsm scores for Heba schools which she wants to go to Boston College or one of the Uc schools. She should aim for 1,500 plus to be safe.

10
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:15.210
Jenny Duan: Hand. Check the specific and target scores on the data that each college releases.

11
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.600
Jenny Duan: When she decides.

12
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.520
Jenny Duan: I'd say preparation

13
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:47.449
Jenny Duan: for standardized testing should start now for sat and psat, which is in both sophomore and Junior fall.

14
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.390
Jenny Duan: Meet one XA week with coach during the summer.

15
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:05.000
Jenny Duan: in addition to bi-weekly check-ins to prep specifically for standardized testing.

16
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.890
Jenny Duan: Okay.

17
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:21.259
Jenny Duan: so now I'm going to review her goals, which are, she's interested in chemical engineering. But she wants to explore these fields, healthcare animal sciences, potentially. Cs and engineering.

18
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:36.140
Jenny Duan: So see right now Heba is interested in chemical engineering, but this

19
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:47.578
Jenny Duan: will get narrowed down once her interests coalesce. Right now I get the feeling that from speaking to her. She doesn't quite know what she wants to do.

20
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.117
Jenny Duan: but I think that once she and her coach

21
00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:12.529
Jenny Duan: figure that out she'll be able to narrow down her profile more into something more specific. Target schools, I think she mentioned. She wants to go to Boston College, Boston University, or Uc. Berkeley, Uc. Schools and T. 50 schools

22
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.180
Jenny Duan: are her goal, well narrowed down

23
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.230
Jenny Duan: as her grades and test scores begin to show a pattern

24
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.270
Jenny Duan: right now, aiming for Boston University or Uc. Berkeley.

25
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.710
Jenny Duan: So focus on good grades in the hardest classes possible.

26
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.010
Jenny Duan: This is the general strategy for

27
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.709
Jenny Duan: college applications. Make sure to take foreign language

28
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.789
Jenny Duan: classes all 4 years and focus on course rigor when possible.

29
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.649
Jenny Duan: Aps, honors, etc. Focus

30
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:17.990
Jenny Duan: on good. A lot of this advice is just general advice, because right now she is still a freshman. So the most important thing is to just get good grades and take difficult classes and stem courses. If interested in

31
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.980
Jenny Duan: chemical engineering.

32
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:34.559
Jenny Duan: Later, in her high school experience, she should add ap chemistry, apcsp, apcsa.

33
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:43.260
Jenny Duan: ap biology, and pretty much all of the ap hard sciences. You should take ap calculus ap in a foreign language.

34
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:58.829
Jenny Duan: Okay? So right now, keep us still narrowing down

35
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:11.279
Jenny Duan: her specific focus. She should consider early exploration in the following domains, healthcare animal sciences.

36
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.830
Jenny Duan: See us engineering.

37
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:28.829
Jenny Duan: Once she has this narrowed down, she can work with her coach to develop a specific niche in one or multiple areas.

38
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.949
Jenny Duan: Why it works for the student. Eva needs to pick a topic, a domain of interest

39
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:48.200
Jenny Duan: service, area, passion area or niche subject to demonstrate interest in ideally the school

40
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:58.730
Jenny Duan: she chooses to go to will allow her to have flexibility in her major for flexibility

41
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:11.280
Jenny Duan: in her major, so she can change as needed, but she should focus on one to demonstrate depth in her application.

42
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:27.059
Jenny Duan: So let's see academics right now. Heba is enrolled in all regular classes.

43
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:37.589
Jenny Duan: Next year she will be in honors classes, but is still lacking in Aps. She needs to increase her.

44
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.060
Jenny Duan: Where's rigor?

45
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:50.040
Jenny Duan: Eva needs to deepen her leadership in extracurriculars.

46
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:58.599
Jenny Duan: She can do this by starting a club at school next year, or starting her own

47
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:08.829
Jenny Duan: or joining local boards, deepening her leadership in local organizations.

48
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:15.240
Jenny Duan: We both also needs to just simply increase number of Ecs.

49
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.799
Jenny Duan: She does for the common app.

50
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.040
Jenny Duan: You mean 10. The Uc app needs

51
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:33.770
Jenny Duan: the total of 20 across both Ecs and awards right now.

52
00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:39.329
Jenny Duan: right now he but does not have any significant

53
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.809
Jenny Duan: awards. This is something she can deepen through academic

54
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:53.199
Jenny Duan: competitions like mock trial science, Olympiad, etcetera.

55
00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:04.489
Jenny Duan: Service awards, school awards, essay contests and scholarships.

56
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:14.319
Jenny Duan: the also for extracurriculars. The Ecs that Heba is a part of

57
00:09:15.326 --> 00:09:17.860
Jenny Duan: don't show her comparative advantage.

58
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:27.570
Jenny Duan: For example, track Kiba does track

59
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.829
Jenny Duan: for fun, but doesn't seem to

60
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:41.329
Jenny Duan: dedicate significant time or energy to it. She should choose things that she

61
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:50.490
Jenny Duan: willing to put in to invest effort to be be best in

62
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:10.159
Jenny Duan: Eva has no test supports yet alright, and then narrative, because Heba does not yet know what she's

63
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.170
Jenny Duan: interested in.

64
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:23.159
Jenny Duan: She doesn't have a narrative. This will be something her and her coach can work on together.

65
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:32.099
Jenny Duan: It goes. Seems unclear with her life direction and goals

66
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:40.459
Jenny Duan: her and her coach, and work together to build discipline and clarity.

67
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.499
Jenny Duan: So summer programs you should sign up for the code with

68
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.699
Jenny Duan: Flossy waitlist, and also the girls who code waitlist.

69
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.900
Jenny Duan: Yes, intro programs.

70
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:23.040
Jenny Duan: Neeba's father mentioned that Heba might be interested in Cs.

71
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.800
Jenny Duan: If she tries it again.

72
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:35.129
Jenny Duan: The following opportunities are still available on a wait list basis.

73
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:46.690
Jenny Duan: I would email the team about her interest

74
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.680
Jenny Duan: who should take the time to start a club at school.

75
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:11.439
Jenny Duan: yeah, maybe something related to animal advocacy or pre-health.

76
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:21.910
Jenny Duan: She could also the classic competitions to join our Hosa and

77
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.490
Jenny Duan: posa science, Olympiad Science Bowl and

78
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:36.319
Jenny Duan: If she's interested in pre-health, red Cross Club

79
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:54.130
Jenny Duan: building is nice Care Project, there's something

80
00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:01.710
Jenny Duan: relating to women's healthcare, and how that's overlooked in medicine.

81
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:09.210
Jenny Duan: So healthcare gonna do a search for her.

82
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:12.929
Jenny Duan: You're welcome

83
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.969
Jenny Duan: getting involved with the following organizations.

84
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.470
Jenny Duan: California.

85
00:14:52.510 --> 00:15:00.789
Jenny Duan: So right now, what I'm doing is doing a search for nonprofits that she could potentially be involved in

86
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.990
Jenny Duan: need to figure out what oasis for curls is

87
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.950
Jenny Duan: animal advocacy.

88
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.260
Jenny Duan: I wonder how many?

89
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:50.135
Jenny Duan: So something that Heba and I kind of talked about was

90
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:59.100
Jenny Duan: doing some type of project. Eva should start a project where she explores the following career paths

91
00:17:00.193 --> 00:17:10.240
Jenny Duan: through shadowing interviews, and maybe turning her experience into some type of blog.

92
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:38.170
Jenny Duan: You guys should identify people working in these fields through her parents, or by making a Linkedin

93
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.410
Jenny Duan: account, and I'm reaching out and reach out to them.

94
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:55.590
Jenny Duan: These short 30 min interviews can help her narrow down her own

95
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.050
Jenny Duan: community and health organization.

96
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.199
Jenny Duan: See from here and work your way up.

97
00:18:17.142 --> 00:18:26.599
Jenny Duan: So I know that she goes to Mountain House. So Tracy, California animal volunteering something she might be interested in.

98
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.369
Jenny Duan: Let's see what else

99
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:45.320
Jenny Duan: I'm going to do. A search for her in person in Tracy, California.

100
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.910
Jenny Duan: See? Like how she might be able to help

101
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.510
Jenny Duan: 100 volunteer opportunities.

102
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.120
Jenny Duan: And then kindness looks good.

103
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:59.310
Jenny Duan: Volunteer Valentine Hospital.

104
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:51.350
Jenny Duan: Okay? And so I identified some opportunities for her. And then from here she can take this to her coach, and they can work on a custom plan for her. I think that the most immediate next steps will be submitting those waitlist steps for code with classy and girls who code submitting this oasis for girls summer program. And then looking into these, the following volunteer opportunities. Again, everything is kind of contingent on how

105
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:58.229
Jenny Duan: Hiba chooses, like which direction she wants to go in. But hopefully these are some inspiration ideas that she'll be able to use to take to the next step.

106
00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:58.880
Jenny Duan: Thanks.
