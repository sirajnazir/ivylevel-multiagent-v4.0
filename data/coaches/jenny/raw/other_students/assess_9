00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.770
See.

2
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.090
Ajay: Safety.

3
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.630
Ajay: It's a contract. Yes, sir.

4
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.301
Jenny Duan: Hi! How's it going.

5
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.570
Ajay: Good afternoon, good evening.

6
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.499
Jenny Duan: Hello! Nice to see.

7
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.261
Ivylevel: Oh, you know, we were actually having back to back. So we're wrapping up.

8
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.160
Ajay: All

9
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.349
Ajay: so, Janishi, you're still in China.

10
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.248
Jenny Duan: Yeah. I'm still in China right now.

11
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.620
Ajay: Okay. Okay.

12
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.470
Ajay: is it? It is early morning there, right? 8 o'clock, or something.

13
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.059
Jenny Duan: Yeah. 8. Am. Right? Now.

14
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.550
Ajay: Yeah.

15
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.110
Ajay: what could

16
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.069
Ajay: at least that for you.

17
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.099
Jenny Duan: Yes. Well, thanks so much for taking the time, Sarah. Did you want to say anything, or should I just start kick biking it off.

18
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.269
Ivylevel: Yeah, I think just wanted to set the stage. And you know, let me also share the report of you know the kind of initial work. So

19
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.793
Ivylevel: a few things like

20
00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:37.079
Ivylevel: great to see you all. How was your day today? Rf. Was good.

21
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.280
Ajay: Oh, Scott, yeah.

22
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:51.979
Ivylevel: Awesome. So I think you know, we, as I said last time, you know, we actually kind of flipped the model. So I actually want to be a bit more like, you know, prescriptive this time to really bring out a lot of exact value. I know there are pressing needs.

23
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:08.340
Ivylevel: you know, previous customer, like, you know, they were really having this pressing need around. You know, summer programs right? And then Ap core selection, and this I think those are kind of important, and we have tried best to address. But I would actually love Jenny for us to go back to our kind of really framework and roots.

24
00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:34.030
Ivylevel: In really showing, you know, bringing out, getting into that 5 eyes, getting out the real passion and really trying to build a unique, a non cookie cutter profile, a non checklist profile. So I think what we'll do is like the just even though, like we fit the model based on whatever we could learn last time, I think it was quite heavy on Ap's and subjects and academics. So I would say, there aren't many specifics that we have still figured out. But we did review, like, you know, the initial kind of

25
00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:45.979
Ivylevel: session. The responses in our team meeting, and we have collected feedback. There are some top recommendations. Again, as I said, we are really talking about 70% of the profile is all non academics and extra critical that really helps you stand out.

26
00:02:45.980 --> 00:03:07.990
Ivylevel: So we are actually viewing from that perspective. And there are some recommendations very specific based on whatever has come out. So maybe you can just like, initially present, that Jenny and I can just walk through those session. The report is still in a draft mode, and the reason why we do it is like, you know, we don't want to just have one session and then send you over the the draft, like, you know, a report right? We want to collaboratively get your feedback during this whole week.

27
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:29.229
Ivylevel: And then further, like, you know, tie to answer more questions in it, and I think we can go initially to that that report, and you can just kind of share. Your kind of initial recommendations and thoughts on how how you felt about you know. And then what we can do is I'll let you basically ship gears and go a bit more on you know that if that makes sense. And of course you know, of course, any times like you know.

28
00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:38.920
Ivylevel: Interrupt and let us know. I think my only request would be like, you know. Let's go to our kind of real formula. Because I think I think there's a lot of value there. So that's just my my question.

29
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.950
Ajay: You know I'm okay. If you want to go with the real formula, and then we can come back to the report. I.

30
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.750
Ajay: That's fine. I yeah. I joined as well.

31
00:03:47.920 --> 00:04:01.190
Ivylevel: Yeah, I think it will be a good kind of a segue. So I'll just let like, you know, more like a kicking off, because the real formula is also about really your passion, your profile? Right? I think last and and nothing against it. Right? I'm I'm just saying academics is very important.

32
00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:09.910
Ivylevel: But I I just think that there's there's more value to be untapped on the non academic side, the the main standout factor.

33
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:22.399
Ivylevel: So yeah, I think and and we do have. You know this as a high. I I think you can come come to this lay, or do you wanna start here Jenny first, and then go to the kind of non the extra curricular items.

34
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:42.555
Jenny Duan: Sure I think this is a little bit nitty gritty, I think I I just went through your course selection. I went through I looked at the information that you sent over about the courses, offer the requirements, and I just highlighted what I think would be the best path for you at both schools. But I think we can just send this over later. I think we I don't think we need to spend a lot of time on this. Just

35
00:04:43.350 --> 00:05:02.109
Jenny Duan: just my recommendation for the classes. And why? But I think, based on our initial conversation. What really stood out to me the most was your a couple of interest. So programming interest, piano interest. And this need for leadership. I think those were the 3 things that stood out to the most

36
00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:24.140
Jenny Duan: to me about your interest in your background, and I think that I wanted to build off of that this session by really working on picking a niche within computer science and also picking out an impact area for you. Because I think right now, I get the sense that you're interested in computer science as a broader subject, you kind of know, like, what types of things you enjoy doing. But you're not specific yet about

37
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:54.007
Jenny Duan: what kind of impact do you want to have in the world, or what specific field you want to go down into? I know it's quite early, as you're just about to enter your freshman year of high school, but I think it's good to start exploring, so that when we structure your extra curriculars, we're able to pick targeted ones that don't waste your time, and instead give you that leverage that you will have over other students with more cookie cutter profiles. So with that I kind of wanted to segue into asking you a couple of questions about you know your interest, your background, what you find meaningful and

38
00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:02.030
Jenny Duan: from there. That will help me pick more specific summer programs, more specific extracurriculars and more specific.

39
00:06:02.374 --> 00:06:25.209
Jenny Duan: Everything for you. Instead of doing a more generalized computer science, like, if you were interested in, say, quantum physics or web development, or, you know, doing computer science research, then I would be able to pick more targeted things for you. So I'd like to just start off with, maybe this computer science interest. I know that you really like programming. But I'm curious like where all of this started from, and how

40
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.690
Jenny Duan: how you've seen this grow over time for you.

41
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.455
Ajay: Well, yeah, I started.

42
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.280
Ajay: I started. And

43
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:45.420
Ajay: from first grade we had a computer fare, right? And we we use a software called tariff and logo, which we built like shapes and

44
00:06:45.510 --> 00:07:01.210
Ajay: and different types, and to build a overall project with a specific team. And I want first place in the price, but and that that was really good for me. So I started taking the interest in.

45
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:10.039
Ajay: and software is like certain logo, and eventually made my way to Python, and then I started taking python courses and did projects on these

46
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.359
Ajay: on on it with python. And that's how really sparked my interest for programming.

47
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.580
Jenny Duan: That's really awesome. And what is, have you been able to build any projects? What's your favorite thing that you've built with computer science?

48
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.320
Ajay: So just recently, we built like

49
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.320
Ajay: Howard.

50
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:39.099
Ajay: machine learning model which predicted like, based on on the data gathered, we would predict the if

51
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.970
Ajay: patient has

52
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:49.290
Ajay: anemia or not sickle cell anemia or not, so that one was the most recent project which was really nice for me.

53
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.539
Jenny Duan: Read a.

54
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.190
Ajay: Move.

55
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.640
Jenny Duan: Well.

56
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.530
Ajay: When we built in a school.

57
00:07:53.935 --> 00:08:02.810
Ajay: I also built a chat box like in sixth grade in my school for computer fare, which also run first place. But yeah, that was

58
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:12.929
Ajay: right. That was a really nice concept with me, cause like, I started exploring other chat bots, which is but like more advanced like chat to bt.

59
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.420
Ajay: but like, yeah.

60
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.870
Jenny Duan: Can you tell me a bit about computer fare? I don't really know what this is.

61
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:31.600
Ajay: Yeah, it's just it's it's in challenger like previous school. So as a computer fare we, we were given a topic to do a project on, and you were given 8 weeks to

62
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:50.850
Ajay: like, plan the project and build the project. So the first one I did was interpret logo, but the one in sixth grade was with python. And we were just. We were tasked for building a chat bot to like interact with the user and like make it interesting and creative.

63
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.610
Ajay: and use your skills to enhance it.

64
00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:02.889
Jenny Duan: How did you build this chat? Bot can you walk me through the steps, and any like difficulties or points of confusion in the process.

65
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:22.840
Ajay: Yeah, it was. It was 2 years ago. But but I think first building like the platform and the plan for how I'm gonna structure, the class chat, bot, and and we did it since we did it with mostly if statements

66
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.195
Ajay: at that time, but just really

67
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:34.919
Ajay: like planning it out about that. Yeah, we also built the

68
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:46.360
Ajay: right. We is use lists to store different types of responses. And we use those responses to depending on the type of question they look for.

69
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.399
Ajay: I bet. Oh, I don't think.

70
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.070
Jenny Duan: Gold

71
00:09:49.736 --> 00:09:54.799
Jenny Duan: that's really cool. I'm curious. Do you know what natural language processing is? Have you ever heard of this.

72
00:09:56.913 --> 00:09:57.939
Ajay: You know

73
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.230
Ajay: true.

74
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:25.607
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So natural language processing is a branch of AI that deals with understanding like human text and human language. So chat Gbt is a form of you know, machine learning. It's a form of artificial intelligence that uses naturally which processing research to be able to communicate similar to how how a human would. And so it's all about like understanding, text, understanding structure, breaking down the way that humans use language in order to train a mute

75
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:42.140
Jenny Duan: to train a machine to do the same thing. And so maybe that's one area of computer science you might be interested in. I'm curious if you have any like specific areas or applications of computer science that you like the best I know you did something to detect. Was it sick sickle cell anemia? Right?

76
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:50.585
Ajay: Yeah, it says, maybe we can do it in different types of pictures. But this time we did it with data, like, specifically,

77
00:10:51.853 --> 00:11:00.180
Ajay: depending on the patient. But we we could do it later on, pictures and other types of data set of that.

78
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.250
Ajay: Sure right? So.

79
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:15.249
Jenny Duan: So I'm curious if, if, like going into medicine like biotechnologies or bioinformatics or bio imaging, is, is that an interest for you? Or is it more? The data science and machine learning aspect that's interesting to you.

80
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:32.999
Ajay: Yeah, so I still more, the data science part, cause we did this one cause. It seemed interesting. And the data set, we found was also very interesting. Cause we're, there's a lot of data plans we could, we could have used. But it's really more the full data science and machine learning aspect of it.

81
00:11:34.050 --> 00:12:02.190
Jenny Duan: Got it. So people so historically, I think data science is an amazing tool that can be used in a lot of different applications. I think what we can do is pick a couple of areas where you want to apply your data science knowledge to to solving a modern social community environmental problem. And so if you think about the world, are there any broad areas that you feel interested in impacting someday like any issues that you want to contribute to solving in in some way, shape or form.

82
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:15.559
Ajay: Yeah, I mean, last time, I I said, climate change, and that is still there, like, I really want to make it impact on climate change cause. It's product. It's probably gonna affect our generation the most.

83
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:26.609
Ajay: So. And for our future generations we need to help the planet. And the other day was, earth Day has saved electricity. And

84
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.675
Ajay: yeah, our school has, like a checklist of things we should do for that day.

85
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.934
Ajay: And yeah, that's the main problem that I want to solve.

86
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.629
Ajay: Thank you.

87
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:56.874
Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay? And climate change is is kind of broad. So are there any specific aspects of climate change you wanna focus on? Or if not, that's something that I can do. Research it and help you figure out, too, but not off the top of your head. Like is electricity usage, something you're interested in? Is it more animal conservation like, is there a niche of of

88
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.619
Jenny Duan: of environmental impact that you want to work in.

89
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.249
Ajay: I guess. Just really like limiting

90
00:13:03.963 --> 00:13:13.620
Ajay: like toxic gases and like managing that like output, like from factories for cars, trucks, transportation.

91
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.810
Ajay: Better.

92
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.470
Jenny Duan: Yeah. And how do you see yourself tackling this problem?

93
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:27.170
Ajay: Like, we could use data points and gather information from the usage of different power plans and different

94
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.770
Ajay: type, the overall transportation industry. And we could make recommendations on how

95
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.410
Ajay: we could help progress and solve the issue.

96
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:56.699
Jenny Duan: Yeah, something that this kind of reminds me of is the United States right now is passing a major initiative to transition to green energy in terms of like electric vehicles. I'm sure you've heard about this. I mean, living in the Bay area like, you see, something Tesla's on the street right? And so I think one thing that

97
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:12.510
Jenny Duan: could be useful is some way to measure the efficacy of that clean energy transition. So in cities with more green more electric vehicles compared to other cities like, what are the pollution rates? And and how does how do electric vehicles

98
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:28.230
Jenny Duan: contribute to decreasing pollution. I think that is an interesting area that you might want to look more into alongside the factory thing, like basically creating some type of algorithm or system to measure emissions and to track that over time, right? Or like some database that tracks

99
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:44.477
Jenny Duan: the amount of particles in the air or the air quality over a period of time depending on various factors. Whether that be, I think you could probably set it to like cars, factories. The presence of coal or steel plans in that in that region like you could,

100
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.050
Jenny Duan: I guess, use that for a lot of different independent variables with the same sort of algorithm, how do you.

101
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:50.450
Ajay: Yeah.

102
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.479
Jenny Duan: The same system. How do you feel about that.

103
00:14:52.480 --> 00:15:03.820
Ajay: Yeah, I think that's a that's a really good idea. And that's what I was thinking about, like creating databases and gathering those information. Store them in one place and use that information

104
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.400
Ajay: to the club.

105
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:27.409
Jenny Duan: I think that is really interesting. I think that's something you could we could talk about is maybe finding a couple of professors to work with in in local area universities and see if you could add to their research. I think that that could be like a really valuable way for you to do research with the support of an institution, and also get some credibility to your work and make it a bit easier for you, because I think

106
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:53.219
Jenny Duan: like companies might not be willing to release their data. I think the hardest part will be getting the data from the companies like companies might not be willing to release their data, especially if it doesn't position the in the best light right to students. But maybe if you work with a university lab or university professor, say at like Stanford, or see Davis or San Jose State, or any of these local universities, they might be able to give you that leverage and credibility to work directly with those companies.

107
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.900
Jenny Duan: So that seems really interesting to me. Another thing is

108
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:27.649
Jenny Duan: I'm curious like, that's so. That's one way you can make impact. How else can you make impact in the environmental sector? Because we wanna also find or brainstorm some ways for you to build your leadership. So doing, research is really a basic. But you are not necessarily working with a whole group of people. When you do research, you're probably collaborating only with your research lab, with your direct mentor, or maybe with other scientists. But we wanna find a way for you to demonstrate your leadership to. You know your peers, the people in your community, etc. So

109
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.126
Jenny Duan: bridging off this environmental science interest, in what ways do you feel like you could

110
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.689
Jenny Duan: demonstrate leadership, or you could engage with other people in this. In this field.

111
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.850
Ajay: or like

112
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.280
Ajay: I couldn't.

113
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.460
Ajay: This wouldn't be for like

114
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.989
Ajay: creating databases, but I could volunteer at at places that

115
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:58.270
Ajay: clean up highways or picks up trash and clean up everywhere and like show leadership in that. But

116
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.170
Ajay: I guess we could still brainstorm.

117
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:12.749
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's a really good idea. I'll do some research on local institutions that you could volunteer with. But I think that definitely bringing on those highway. Phoenix is a good idea, or even science education

118
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:21.050
Jenny Duan: like the importance of clean energy, I think, or clean communities. I think? Maybe not. Every community has access to this type of

119
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:29.830
Jenny Duan: just information or resources to learn more about environmental science and the impact. So maybe like doing something like that could also be valuable.

120
00:17:31.072 --> 00:17:32.710
Jenny Duan: What do you think about that.

121
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.820
Ajay: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

122
00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:50.430
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, amazing. And then I think that eventually, when you go to high school, regardless of what high school you pick, I'm sure there will be lots of clubs and opportunities for you to take leadership positions in there in those clubs as well.

123
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.390
Ajay: Group.

124
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.679
Jenny Duan: Maybe that's one thing we can actually think about right now defining your club structure in high school, because I think.

125
00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:20.899
Jenny Duan: regardless of whatever high school you go to, like, similar clubs will exist like, there will probably be some type of environmental club that you could join, but beyond that, like, what other clubs would you be interested in joining like maybe a Cs club like any other things? And then if there, if this club that you want doesn't exist. You could have the opportunity to start one as well, which is not necessary, but maybe, like

126
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.740
Jenny Duan: helpful, for you.

127
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:23.900
Ajay: There.

128
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:43.970
Ajay: So yeah, I'm I'm in a Ml. Club right now. Which is the project that we did recently I was in that club. We did that project with with group members. But I wanna join like a similar club like that, like, there's a club like art of computer algorithms that I want to join next year as well.

129
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.140
Ajay: Soft.

130
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.110
Ajay: That is what.

131
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.420
Jenny Duan: What is that called involve art of computer algorithms.

132
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:59.030
Ajay: It's like, I'll I don't know like the exact details. But we obviously that they obviously go through like different types of algorithms you could use in AI,

133
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.400
Ajay: sir, that's.

134
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:10.430
Jenny Duan: Super cool. Yeah, I think. Some other clubs. Are there any like non academic or service clubs that you might be interested in too.

135
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:22.690
Ajay: Well, I don't know any of the top of my head. I could still do my zoom or research and look through the clubs that my school offers, that.

136
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:46.999
Jenny Duan: Yeah, no problem. I can also look at that, too. I, yeah, I could research. It's very probably pretty easy to find the bellerman and basis club directories online. So I can also take a look at those and suggest some targeted specific clubs. I think that definitely having a mix of academic and non academic involvements is going to be really important. Because I think right now, a lot of our focus is strictly academic. So.

137
00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:04.550
Jenny Duan: looking at the different search opportunities, the different like things you could do with computer science. But I think it's also very important to demonstrate a breath of experiences. So not only depth in a specific field, but also that you could interact in a variety of different environments with a lot of different types of students. And so.

138
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:14.559
Jenny Duan: I think that, like thinking about other extracurricular activities that are non academic, such as like the volunteering that you mentioned or cultural community involvement could also be important.

139
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.610
Jenny Duan: I'm curious, like in your day to day life. What do you like to spend the most time doing?

140
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.380
Jenny Duan: It could be anything. It doesn't have to be school related.

141
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.193
Ajay: Watching TV.

142
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.090
Ajay: Wow.

143
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:38.260
Ajay: it's like, not much time, but cause like this, past few weeks have been like.

144
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.630
Ajay: really like a lot.

145
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.390
Ajay: But in free time I would like.

146
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.289
Ajay: That's free time I have.

147
00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:57.422
Ajay: Oh, I wouldn't really do much. I would like take some rest or something, cause I'd be really tired from homework and everything.

148
00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.519
Ajay: Or like, Yeah, watch TV, whenever.

149
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.629
Jenny Duan: Yeah, what? What do you like?

150
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.993
Ajay: Lagos.

151
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.889
Ajay: what do you like.

152
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.700
Jenny Duan: Watch on you.

153
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:15.149
Ajay: Oh, like some anime, or whatever is for Nda, for basketball games.

154
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:20.619
Ajay: basketball games like watching basketball games, especially now, since it's the playoffs.

155
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.280
Ajay: But yeah.

156
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.640
Jenny Duan: And what and what games do you play.

157
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:34.460
Ajay: Hi! Hi! I like. During the pandemic. I used to play like more, but now it's like limited to like

158
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.639
Ajay: I don't play that much, but like roadblocks

159
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.100
Ajay: like that.

160
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.143
Jenny Duan: That's super cool. You know a lot of people. Actually.

161
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:52.620
Jenny Duan: this isn't your story, but a lot of people who code now actually started by coding games on roadblocks. Have you ever met someone who has made a game? Or have you ever created your own game on roadblocks?

162
00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.299
Ajay: No, I haven't created my own game of robots. I don't think I've many

163
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.030
Ajay: right. Thank you.

164
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.149
Jenny Duan: I I mean, games are not all bad.

165
00:22:02.685 --> 00:22:03.060
Ajay: Grace

166
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.140
Ajay: air

167
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.499
Ajay: for sure. So I didn't. Yeah.

168
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.789
Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! I keep interrupting.

169
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.989
Ajay: No, no, I I was saying, that's all I said.

170
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:20.200
Jenny Duan: Got it. Yeah, I think that actually, games are a really good way for you to first of all teach people something, but also like

171
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:46.560
Jenny Duan: games are a cool thing to build because, they involve actually a lot of strategy and mental thinking. So at Stanford. Actually, there's a lot of people who are really interested in playing like strategy games like board games, and some people even create their own like physical board games or computer games, too. So if that's an interest to you, maybe it would be valuable to design like an educational or playable game in the future. To teach like a computer science or math

172
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.620
Jenny Duan: concept

173
00:22:47.720 --> 00:23:15.779
Jenny Duan: to you know, young children, or just to encourage people to think about these concepts in a different way, because I think, like in the future. More and more younger students will need to learn computer science and what we need to learn like, what is an if statement, what is a for loop. Do like? What is a list of, I think, like creating some type of game or something fun and engaging to teach people that could be could be an interesting project for you. Also, like you're really interested in playing games. Do you ever play like

174
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.170
Jenny Duan: chess or poker, or any like strategic thinking games?

175
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.240
Ajay: Yeah, I can chat definitely, chat like on chess.com like, okay.

176
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.190
Jenny Duan: Yeah, wait.

177
00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.889
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Are you good at chess?

178
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.479
Ajay: Yeah, I'm I'm okay.

179
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:51.709
Ajay: It's like he used to play chess before. Yeah, I never like really memorized like all the variations and openings and endings you could play. But like, I know the basic ones, and like how to win. In these types of situations.

180
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.890
Jenny Duan: Certainly have you.

181
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:53.230
Ajay: Watch, the.

182
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.290
Jenny Duan: Please gamble.

183
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.619
Ajay: Yeah, yeah, I have. And we were.

184
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.159
Ajay: yeah, it was on Netflix, right?

185
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:11.479
Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that gave actually got a lot of people interested in chess, I think. But I'm curious like the opposite like, why'd you stop playing chess.

186
00:24:12.347 --> 00:24:30.420
Ajay: Too much time, and then you'd have to go through different things, plus we already had basketball and piano, so we just didn't have enough time to really keep it all, but, like I still do play, I have an account, just a call. I still do play from time to time.

187
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:37.889
Jenny Duan: Do you like math at all like? Do you ever do like competitive math? Or do you like solving math problems.

188
00:24:38.970 --> 00:25:03.839
Ajay: Oh, I did a little bit of commit like I did. I did math and sixth grade. Yeah. But then there were like lot of other things, so we had to narrow down few things for him. The challenge was the piano and the basketball were too much heavy on, because both required the now. They were also competing a lot

189
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:11.070
Ajay: with time requirements. So we spend a lot of time on on basketball, which is 3 days

190
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.559
Ajay: training every day used to come at 2 and 2 h training

191
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:27.849
Ajay: in the night and then the weekend the entire weekend used to go for games Saturday the whole day would be on the games, and then, whatever the time was left, was on the piano.

192
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:33.960
Ajay: So we used to do a lot of other activities before. But then it was, these 2 are consuming

193
00:25:34.476 --> 00:25:53.310
Ajay: and then once you join basis basis took even more. Because the eighth grade was is most difficult, great because of the transition, especially as well. And that that's what we need to. Now figure out. That's why the piano, if you add that to everything

194
00:25:54.004 --> 00:26:03.780
Ajay: Pierre requires an hour plus every day, and and in basis, if we start taking more

195
00:26:04.208 --> 00:26:25.640
Ajay: electives and extracurricular, his day will start at the 7 30 Am. In the morning, and will end at 5 Pm. And and we. That's where I think we have to really utilize this piano as well. It has to be really key

196
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:40.410
Ajay: that if we anchor on piano we know that it's it's the top most time consuming. Because he's right now in the Sixth level, if he, he plans to get to 8. And you want to invest a lot of time this summer

197
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.680
Ajay: is teacher has told him to invest 4 HA day

198
00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:48.339
Ajay: Indian summer, just doing piano.

199
00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.499
Jenny Duan: Whereas it is expensive to be honest.

200
00:26:51.790 --> 00:27:02.259
Ajay: Because, like, you get to level 8, like, there's a lot of stuff you need to learn level 7 plus the theory and the actual pieces as well. So we would start playing those actual pieces

201
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:13.319
Ajay: chat in the summer and then gradually improve that with the technique and everything so like me 3 to 4 HA day in the summer, besides vacation time.

202
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.590
Jenny Duan: Are you doing as Abs Abrsab? Or what testing do you do?

203
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:25.799
Ajay: The Cms in Mtac. It's not the AV it's like a California

204
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.739
Ajay: certificate on merit.

205
00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.490
Jenny Duan: Okay? And what's the maximum number of levels.

206
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:42.110
Ajay: 1010, same as aviors. They test more. But then be more, is it? There's there's like a a board thing after level 10. But like the the level stop at 10.

207
00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:42.900
Ajay: Yeah.

208
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.780
Ajay: Done.

209
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.220
Jenny Duan: Wedding is in Oregon.

210
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.000
Ajay: Next time.

211
00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:46.820
Ajay: Yeah.

212
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.450
Jenny Duan: Okay, and your goal is to get to level 8.

213
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.180
Ajay: Oh, no! Lovely next year.

214
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.300
Ajay: and then

215
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.170
Ajay: 10.

216
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:55.630
Jenny Duan: Like it.

217
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.020
Ajay: Get that allowed.

218
00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.559
Jenny Duan: So okay, it's for.

219
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.140
Jenny Duan: oh, go ahead, go ahead.

220
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:11.290
Ajay: No, I I think the goal was to get to level 10. So for him to get to level 10 by the time he applies for colleges. He needs to be a level 8 next year.

221
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:16.920
Ajay: and then 9 10. By the time he is ready to apply in the senior in the junior year.

222
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:25.587
Jenny Duan: I see, I see. Okay. So for some context, I actually applied to Stanford with a music portfolio, which means, I

223
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:39.100
Jenny Duan: I submitted my application early, so I could turn in. I had to do a 10 min tape, a music resume and a music letter recommendation. I was pretty serious about piano in in high school. I did a lot of competitions and things like that.

224
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.239
Jenny Duan: Personally, I don't think that reaching level

225
00:28:42.581 --> 00:28:54.859
Jenny Duan: level 10 will have a significant impact on your application. I don't think it'll show a spike in piano. I think piano is going to be something that's more personally meaningful than impactful on your college application.

226
00:28:54.860 --> 00:29:17.350
Jenny Duan: But I think what we can do with piano, and this is something that I was writing on the dog that I'll write more about later. But I think what we can do on piano is, turn that into an opportunity for you to demonstrate leadership and service. For example, if you volunteer at a local music radio station or I think, like classical music is, I think, not a lot of youth. Listen to classical music, and it's not something that

227
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:36.220
Jenny Duan: teenagers spend a lot of time on. So if you started an initiative to introduce youth to classical music like A, podcast A video series, something like that, like something unique. And we can spin up different ways to position this. But I think that's what's gonna be more impactful rather than the skill of your piano itself, because I think, unless your

228
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:49.020
Jenny Duan: purchase, like competing internationally unless you're playing at Carnegie Hall stuff like that is not like many people play piano. And so I don't think that reaching level 10 in and of itself is going to have big impact. So I think that maybe.

229
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:49.350
Ajay: Should be.

230
00:29:49.350 --> 00:30:02.230
Jenny Duan: The focus, but rather to turn piano into a medium, to demonstrate your leadership, a unique aspect of your interest, like classical music, being interested in that as a teenager. That's very unique, like not a lot of people do that, and that will set you apart

231
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:13.629
Jenny Duan: volunteering. Maybe it's like playing piano at a local elderly home or something like that like that's what's gonna be more impactful for you. Your narrative and your story, rather than focusing on reaching a certain level.

232
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.129
Jenny Duan: Does that make sense?

233
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.299
Jenny Duan: Yeah, what are your thoughts.

234
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.170
Ajay: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. That makes sense.

235
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.260
Ajay: There's a lot of.

236
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.330
Jenny Duan: And so.

237
00:30:23.293 --> 00:30:40.699
Jenny Duan: yeah, because a lot of people like reach level 10, a lot of people like a lot of people do piano. But they don't actually care about it, or they only do it because they import it. So if you actually care about piano, it's a really good opportunity, because since not a lot of people do. You'll stand out extra if if you do, personally.

238
00:30:41.199 --> 00:30:54.450
Jenny Duan: And so with that, I think like it's probably, is it worth it to spend 4 h in the summer, like, sure, if you have time but 4 h every day, that is a significant, significant time commitment that

239
00:30:54.610 --> 00:31:03.569
Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if ultimately will be worth it. Given your other summer commitments, is it? Do you think it's possible for you to reach Level 8 without spending 4 HA day.

240
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.950
Jenny Duan: maybe like 1 h.

241
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.439
Ajay: Maybe one and a half to 2 h, but like 2 h

242
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:20.870
Ajay: oh, level 8 next year. Oh, might be a little tough, maybe 2 and a half hours could maybe be done. If I use my time efficiently. If you use efficiently better.

243
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:43.520
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Cause I think another thing is like you don't need to. Necessarily, I think, the level of piano that you are when you apply for college. That's rather arbitrary, like, I think, for colleges. They're not gonna care. They're not gonna be like, oh, he's a level 9 instead of a level 10, like we can't admit you because you're a level 9, like they're not gonna make that arbitrary distinction in your place. They're gonna say, Okay, look.

244
00:31:43.520 --> 00:32:11.590
Jenny Duan: here's a student who has invested significant amount of time into an area that they care a lot about. That's valuable. Not that you hit level 10. Not that you hit level 9, because I think the only difference is, if you're an international piano comp competitor and you travel for piano competitions. And this is your whole life. But like that's, that's a whole different person that that person's going to Music conservatory. They're not going to like an Ivy League school, right. So I don't think that's something that you need to be necessarily worried about.

245
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:23.890
Jenny Duan: I think. If it if playing piano too much compromises your other activities. Then don't do it. If it's something that you want to spend your time in doing, then obviously, very personally valuable, and you could

246
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:30.889
Jenny Duan: spend as much time as you want to. But I think, do you need to spend 4 HA day? Probably not.

247
00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:32.749
Jenny Duan: And so

248
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:49.149
Jenny Duan: I think what we can actually talk about is Bill using piano as a launch point for other passion projects. So in terms of piano like, what are you most interested? Are you interested in performing. Are you interested in theory? Are you interested in just practicing like? What about piano.

249
00:32:49.541 --> 00:33:15.349
Ajay: I like playing piano. So I really like listening to classic P classical music like, I always go on Youtube or spotify, or whatever use and try and look. And I also watch classical music channels to learn more about the history of classical music. So, and I just really like the melody of different pieces. I know a lot about composers, and I wanna

250
00:33:15.807 --> 00:33:18.989
Ajay: just play those pieces and cause it feels

251
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.770
Ajay: it's really nice for me.

252
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.040
Jenny Duan: That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious, like.

253
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.340
Jenny Duan: So a couple of things that I think could be really valuable. Projects are, first of all to volunteer at

254
00:33:33.742 --> 00:33:56.619
Jenny Duan: every every city has like a classical music radio station. I think it'd be cool if you could have your own show, or your own segment on that station, or volunteer for some way like to. I think the theme should be to try to introduce younger people to classical music and to talk about. Maybe you could spend like 10 min at the beginning of like someone's radio session doing like composer of the day. Or you could do like.

255
00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:05.739
Jenny Duan: you know. Let's talk about the romantic period and music history. Or let's talk about like, why this unique block piece is so so important in

256
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.359
Jenny Duan: music history. I think. Like if you could

257
00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:12.833
Jenny Duan: have a section on, I think, cause I think you're a good speaker like you're very

258
00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:32.850
Jenny Duan: concise your articulate, and I think you could use that like. You don't need to necessarily do speech and debate like everyone else, to demonstrate that you're a good speaker. Maybe you could be on this radio show, and that would be very unique. Something like that. I think I'll do some more research. I'll put in a couple of suggestions into your document for place to reach out to. I think that's my first suggestion.

259
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:44.429
Jenny Duan: second, suggestion is starting a podcast or like a Youtube channel or a Tiktok channel, or some medium where you talk about music history to other people. I think, like, there's a lot of

260
00:34:44.947 --> 00:34:57.719
Jenny Duan: yeah, there's a lot of need for young people to share, like their passion for music, history, for music theory. And I think that could be a good opportunity for you again to capitalize on something that not a lot of people do

261
00:34:58.004 --> 00:35:01.970
Jenny Duan: and the key here, how to be as unique, as different as possible. You wanna.

262
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:02.390
Ajay: Love!

263
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.389
Jenny Duan: Something that no one has seen before.

264
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:05.570
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

265
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.650
Jenny Duan: So that's option number 2. Option number 3 is I think, like

266
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:39.030
Jenny Duan: doing performances for free and like streaming them, either on Youtube, on Tiktok, or like playing in in local parks at elderly homes like being a performer. If that's what you're interested in that could also be something could do. And obviously you can do a combination of like all of these activities. You could do one of them go to 2 of them, but they're just launch points for you to take this piano thing further from not only something that you do in your house, but something that you share with other people as well.

267
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.499
Jenny Duan: Yeah, what are your thoughts?

268
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.734
Ajay: Yeah, I think

269
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:57.470
Ajay: I think the podcasting I really connected with me like sharing different my knowledge about classical music, with other. The youth like, you know, and the youth, but like different people.

270
00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:03.880
Ajay: And yeah, I think also playing at elderly elderly homes seems fun.

271
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:05.450
Ajay: math.

272
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.200
Jenny Duan: Yeah, that. That. Yeah.

273
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.300
Ajay: The podcasting. Really.

274
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.070
Ajay: I got it connected with people.

275
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:31.619
Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, that's that's really cool. Another thing is, actually, at Stanford. There's a lot of opportunities for you to study like music, computational or computational music, or to combine like music and Cs in a lot of ways. So if you want to do something related to Cs, it'd be cool like, I know, some people are working on different, like.

276
00:36:32.178 --> 00:36:38.349
Jenny Duan: there's different things, for example, AI tools that if you play a song it'll transcribe it for you automatically or

277
00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.139
Jenny Duan: like tools like that

278
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.402
Jenny Duan: to help people?

279
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:52.300
Jenny Duan: And so if that's an interest area you're you're interested in, there's a lot of faculty at Stanford working on that. And so that could be like a good point if you wanted to do something. Cs related. But

280
00:36:52.380 --> 00:37:03.612
Jenny Duan: yeah, those are all some ideas out there. I'll write that behind the plan. You can choose ultimately what you think is the most interesting to you. There's no really wrong. Answer. They're just all different ideas.

281
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:06.860
Jenny Duan: so yeah, I think even with basketball, too.

282
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:19.140
Jenny Duan: I think we could turn basketball into something that is not only a passion for you, but also a way that you make impact. So I'm curious, like, I'll ask the same question to you. What what about basketball is interesting to you. Why do you like it?

283
00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:31.604
Ajay: Oh, playing the sport is really fun and interesting, and knowing all the facts about different Mba teams and keeping up with basketball and playing it, learning different moves.

284
00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.190
Ajay: See how you can move the defender a different direction.

285
00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.659
Ajay: You know this wish

286
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:41.490
Ajay: of the ball going through the net. It's just really interesting, like.

287
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.210
Ajay: I really like that.

288
00:37:44.644 --> 00:37:55.210
Ajay: because, of course, it's exercise as well, plus, it keeps you your body and condition. But those are all secondary. I I just really like the sport, and playing.

289
00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:18.520
Jenny Duan: Definitely. So if you wanted to take basketball a bit further beyond your team, too. Some ideas that I have are you could start like a basketball mentorship or coaching program for like younger kids, maybe especially from like lower income backgrounds or people who don't have as many resources because I know, like, and I it. This might be a summer thing, depending on your capacity for like next summer or the future, but

290
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:32.699
Jenny Duan: I know that in the summer like a lot of, because a lot of parents have to work, and there's no school maybe there, there's opportunity for you to start like a basketball camp, or like a basketball after school, like daycare type of program for young kids. Because I think one of the best things about sport is

291
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:57.950
Jenny Duan: not only that you know you. You get exercise, but I think like playing the sport. You did discipline to just do teamwork communication and like how to put effort in something, and see that reciprocated, I think, like athletics, is one of the best ways and piano to, and music where I can direct your effort into something. And you can see like, okay, if I I know that if I practice 5 h more I'm gonna get better than if I don't practice at all. I think you can see the difference pretty directly.

292
00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:06.259
Jenny Duan: And so, like sports, teach a lot of life skills. And so if you're able to teach that, or translate that to younger students as well. That could be another direction. Where you

293
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:33.810
Jenny Duan: you bring basketball into something bigger, I think, like the theme of all your activities should be like your interest are the starting point. And you wanna see how you can use your interest to make a difference in other people's lives or to take something small and bring it into something very impactful, because lots of people are interested in coding. Lots of people play piano. Lots of people do basketball. But you wanna figure out how you can make these experiences unique to yourself and to differentiate yourself from those other people. And I think like.

294
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:50.390
Jenny Duan: by by showing your passion with other people, by sharing it with other people and by using it to inspire other people. Either you know through the podcast through the mentoring through other computer science projects, you're gonna be able to make a big difference in in the lives of other people which is ultimately like the end goal. Because

295
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:56.239
Jenny Duan: colleges are not only looking for smart intellectual people, they have a million smart people out there. They have a million, like.

296
00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:22.089
Jenny Duan: you know, really high test scores really high rates, whatever. But they're looking for people who they wanna invest in people who will make a difference in the world in some way. I think that, like you're this type of person who has these ideas about how you want to change the world and what you can do to move in that direction. And that's the type of person that colleges wanna take, too. They don't just want people who, you know, have all these checkbox leadership things. They want people who genuinely care about what they're interested in.

297
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:34.699
Jenny Duan: regardless. If that's hot air ballooning, if that's playing basketball, if that's playing video games like, like, you know, there's competitive esports teams out there at schools, too, like schools have competitive. They recruit people to like play league of legends to play Valerie like

298
00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:43.919
Jenny Duan: I think colleges really do not care what you do as long as you're passionate about it, and you're able to use that to make an impact in in the lives of other people.

299
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.000
Jenny Duan: Yeah.

300
00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.740
Jenny Duan: a month.

301
00:40:46.760 --> 00:41:13.189
Jenny Duan: So I think that that's a like, that's a really good start. I think that having these interest focused down on like, maybe piano basketball Cs will also help shape your extracurriculars moving forward. I think I know summer programs are also a big area of concern. I think that if you start research right now, or the summer, or soon, you'll be in a good position to apply for some of the more competitive research programs in your Junior year or or sophomore year of high school, which are

302
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:17.100
Jenny Duan: the more impactful summer. So have you heard it like Ssp or Rsi.

303
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.100
Ajay: No. Yeah.

304
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:34.899
Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, these, this is something to be actually good to be thinking about early on there are some programs. So with summer programs. There's a wide variety. What what you want to avoid is these paid summer programs that basically you you go into like.

305
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:57.559
Jenny Duan: I don't know, like, learn and learn an AI skill, or they market it as you go there and like, learn business or something. But you pay a very expensive amount. And it's basically like pay to win. If you can pay it, you could get in. And you just do something random that doesn't have a big impact. But what you actually want to optimize for our free summer programs. So summer programs that will actually fly you out there, pay for your stay, pay for your entire instruction.

306
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:20.959
Jenny Duan: And those types of programs some people call them like the ticket to Iv or the ticket to a good school, because typically the types of people that get admitted to those programs are the type of people who get admitted into top schools later on. And so there are these programs called the research Signs Institute and Summer Science program that happened in the junior year of high School. I'll also write this on the doc, so don't worry about it right now, too. That

307
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:31.259
Jenny Duan: I think if you position yourself well, you'll have a really good shot for. And those programs like pretty much all their their students go to top schools like I. I know I can count like at least

308
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:46.490
Jenny Duan: like 10 Ssp graduates at Stanford right now. And that's not necessarily because those programs prepare you for top schools. I mean they do. But because the type of person who gets into those programs also gets into like the elite institutions. And so

309
00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:58.430
Jenny Duan: I think that like doing something like that over your junior or junior summer or sophomore summer is going to be impactful. And we can start planning for that now. I think. As for your freshman summer and your eighth grade summer.

310
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:14.239
Jenny Duan: I think you should use these as more opportunities for exploration. So, for example, for the research aspect to explore a new topic, something that you might be interested in learning, but don't know that much about, because I think, fresh in and eighth grade summer. You should use it to upscale, and also to learn, because chances are like.

311
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:30.619
Jenny Duan: I don't think colleges will really ask you for what you do in eighth grade, or what you did in ninth grade. But they might want to know, like what you're curious about. So if if you just take this as an opportunity for yourself to learn about subjects, the interest areas that you you care about, I think that will be the best use of your eighth grade and ninth grade summers.

312
00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:36.420
Jenny Duan: Yeah, so I wouldn't worry too much about flying for summer programs now, or even next year, because

313
00:43:36.510 --> 00:44:03.800
Jenny Duan: I think that first of all, you're gonna be too young. You're basically once you're 16. That's kind of when you're eligible for more of the competitive summer programs before that. Like, I think all the programs think that you're like too young, or you're not like emotionally mature enough to really go and like, go to another state and like, learn something new. So before you turn 16, I'd say, like, everything is is okay. If you don't apply for any summer programs, or that might not even be the best strategy. But

314
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:20.580
Jenny Duan: I think once you enter your sophomore or junior year of high school, that's when summer programs actually come into the picture. So I don't think you need to spend a lot of time worrying about that right now. I think right now what we. What would be best for you is to look into research and try to discover what subject areas you're interested in.

315
00:44:22.003 --> 00:44:22.990
Ajay: That's that's.

316
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.625
Jenny Duan: Cool

317
00:44:24.671 --> 00:44:31.510
Jenny Duan: and so I think, like speaking about the subject areas, I actually want to go back to Cs again. So

318
00:44:32.021 --> 00:44:48.289
Jenny Duan: we talked a little. I think we focused more of our conversation on like machine learning and artificial intelligence. But is this actually the area that you are most interested in? Or are you more interested in like web development, app development, or even cyber security? Or is it mostly just data? Science? AI.

319
00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.375
Ajay: Yeah, it's

320
00:44:51.740 --> 00:45:09.569
Ajay: no, I don't like web development like after the moment. But it's mostly just data sensitive. I I I think he has to explore a little bit in this this summer as well. I have tried to give him some projects before. Yeah.

321
00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.929
Ajay: just like building something like, Take take a problem and try to solve a problem.

322
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.539
Ajay: Whatever it takes. Learn?

323
00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:21.330
Ajay: We'll build something. I think he, if he's explores certain area.

324
00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:43.899
Ajay: I think cyber security is is definitely another area where they can apply the concepts of how to solve a problem. There, probably other areas of how to how to build something on Silicon on AI that there's so many areas indeed, he has not been exposed to. I'm sure I think that's why we're looking at

325
00:45:44.247 --> 00:45:55.719
Ajay: eighth and ninth summers for him to do a little bit more exploration. I mean, I have so many thoughts of what he he can do. But at least

326
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.690
Ajay: I am not.

327
00:45:57.202 --> 00:46:02.789
Ajay: Because I'm gonna I hit the cyber security for my company, and I'm not even

328
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:17.729
Ajay: saying anything about that, because I want him to feel that, hey? That's an area I want to go into. But yes, I think his exploration is required. I think he just knows data science and AI more, because that's currently

329
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:30.889
Ajay: very hot topic current what's going on. And also he's been just exposed to that recently. But I still wanted to explore other areas right? How? How does even such work, for example? Why would?

330
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.989
Ajay: Why, there are so many engineers in Google are met are doing something

331
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:47.090
Ajay: in that level which is not. Not many people know, because you only see the apps part of it. But what's happening in the back end. So there are a lot of areas I think he should explore before he makes that decision.

332
00:46:48.060 --> 00:47:06.749
Jenny Duan: I think so too. And also, I would add to that, like also, quantum computing, I think, is gonna be really important in the future. Maybe that's something you could look into. Also. I don't know if you've gotten the chance to explore electronics or any hardware but maybe that's another thing that you can look into like circuits like redboard design, like chips.

333
00:47:06.975 --> 00:47:07.200
Ajay: Yeah.

334
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.069
Jenny Duan: That is, yeah.

335
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.290
Jenny Duan: Yeah. Arduino's yeah. All those things. Maybe you can.

336
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:21.318
Ajay: We haven't at home since my years. It doesn't work.

337
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:23.640
Jenny Duan: More than I do. Start.

338
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.260
Ajay: Yeah.

339
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:40.699
Jenny Duan: So I think maybe this summary would be good to like, take a broader look at computer science as a whole subject, and see like, what specific topic you wanna focus on, I think algorithms are always gonna be important data. Science is always gonna important. Be gonna be important, no matter what you do. But

340
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:59.590
Jenny Duan: you might wanna look into like what other areas you might be interested into to see eventually, like, if you could find something more even even more specific, or just something else that you might want to learn about. Because I think right now is AI is very hype. Maybe it won't be in the next couple of years. Or maybe there's a specific aspect of AI that

341
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:21.660
Jenny Duan: you want to go more into, like machine learning or vision. Or, you know, natural language processing or something else. Cognition maybe, like learning about how the brain works and how that influences AI like there's lots of different realms. You could take. So I would try to spend some time this summer and look into these different areas of what is what you think is the most interesting after you're able to understand everything.

342
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:39.210
Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay. I think that we today we went over a lot. We talked about summer. We talked about, you know, leadership. We talked about piano classes, clubs, and basketball. And then also the social impact area and research with computer science.

343
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:49.990
Jenny Duan: Is there anything else that you wanted to sort of talk about, or I wanted to give some time to see if you had any questions about your extracurriculars, your plan, any other areas to explore.

344
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:57.709
Ajay: well, not not really at the

345
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.380
Ajay: well. I can think of.

346
00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:11.180
Jenny Duan: Yeah, and if your parents have any questions, I think now it's also a good time to ask. Obviously, we'll if you have any emails, we could always answer emails. But if there's anything right now, too.

347
00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.300
Ajay: Yeah, I I I think the

348
00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:40.500
Ajay: yeah, the the exploration. I think the some of the things we discussed is great. I think we need to figure out as as we've been discussing how he can stand out in doing this and combine his passion with with the over, I think, is is a fantastic idea, and I think that will also help him explore of what he is. I think lot of things he's seeing today. We never heard before. So I think it's good what we did.

349
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:50.229
Ajay: So I I think that's that's really. But how do we package? How do we do all of this. And how do we build a plan? I think that's that's probably what would be the next step as of now

350
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:51.990
Ajay: we we don't have

351
00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:55.079
Ajay: any questions. I think it's kind of.

352
00:49:55.550 --> 00:50:03.489
Ajay: There's so much information we have already gathered, and we have discussed. I think we're going in the probably the right right direction.

353
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.440
Ajay: Zeph.

354
00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:21.650
Ivylevel: Amazing. Yeah, I think, thanks a lot. I'm glad that we were able to go much beyond, you know the topic. But I think that's why it's good that we had actually kept it for 2 weeks. And you know, it's kind of this particular service that we do right. It's a double edged sword, you know, and we have learned a lot as we have gone through this, because

355
00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:32.420
Ivylevel: I think information and knowledge is the easiest part right? And I think this is where what happens is it's very it's, you know. It's it's very easy for us to give a lot of information

356
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:35.160
Ivylevel: and also the framework as we have discussed. Right?

357
00:50:35.476 --> 00:50:44.079
Ivylevel: What happens is like it. Certain times aligns with parents and certain times. Not right? So they are like, you know, and and sometimes parents just want more.

358
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:58.349
Ivylevel: And you know you give a report with so much detail and so much framework. And and I'm not saying that that's the case. But all I can tell that you know, 2 weeks is not the time where we are able to really deliver even like much more bigger impact. It is an iterative process.

359
00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:02.440
Ivylevel: and execution is where every difference happen. And I can tell you that.

360
00:51:02.878 --> 00:51:20.789
Ivylevel: There are students who are working with us eighth graders, fifth graders. And the reason why a lot of people actually work on. It is because the thing that really stands out are these big ticket items, right? Which is building a business, doing, publishing a research paper, doing a few things that are actually going to drive the biggest community impact.

361
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.590
Ivylevel: I'll tell you what honestly, the

362
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:30.849
Ivylevel: the thing is right and what my fight is against. Parents come to me because they are like, really in that board. Now, summer program, I'm telling you that I've done this 100 times.

363
00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:41.620
Ivylevel: We are all gonna sit there and look at the chaos and frenzy where we don't want our kid to be missing any opportunity. We're gonna sign up for 2,000 3,000 $5,000 upscaling programs just like that. Right?

364
00:51:41.750 --> 00:52:06.629
Ivylevel: The in grand scheme of things, as Jenny said, including Sales Stanford. And to be very honest, Ivy League is actually they are quite culprit when it comes to this, because they actually advertise this as a very, very important thing. And now anything with an AI kind of prefix or suffix actually sells. We all know that. Why haven't haven't we done that? Because it's much. It's very easy to kind of, you know, swipe your card, get into a program, have a structured thing, learn something, and come out

365
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:11.600
Ivylevel: and actually think that that is an extracurricular. The thing that really stands out and which is hard

366
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:18.279
Ivylevel: to build a community impact project that drives an impact and skill. That is an ivy level skill.

367
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:33.279
Ivylevel: It comes, you know. And and we see this unfortunately, during the struggles, right? And and I think this is a significant difference on people who are building a non cookie cutter profile, and students who are going after a very niche profile.

368
00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:41.389
Ivylevel: which is you identify? You show your depth, you work on standout things, and the only way to stand out is to not fit. In.

369
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:45.579
Ivylevel: Simple as that. You start fitting in and putting yourself in a mold.

370
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:47.460
Ivylevel: You don't stand out.

371
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.119
Ivylevel: Unfortunately, everyone tries to do that

372
00:52:50.300 --> 00:53:00.260
Ivylevel: because you're really looking okay. I want to be in these very clubs, and I want to do this. X and Y. Now, I'll tell you what is the biggest struggle and why this whole program came about. And we've really created this ground up.

373
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:14.999
Ivylevel: And you know I've shown you all these documents. Honestly, I don't need a single line of code today. Thankfully, we have so much demand and pull, mainly because of the fact that we are focused on the real unmet need of these students who are not able to deliver that impact.

374
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:31.010
Ivylevel: The people like, you know, talking about an Instagram channel, talking about a social Youtube channel. When you think of successful candidates, you know. And Jenny is a great example. She's a social media influence herself, you know. She's got. So I think when you start thinking about these students who have really built these kind of businesses publish those kind of research papers.

375
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:41.270
Ivylevel: It is not just about doing a particular skill, learning a thing and checking a box. They've been able to literally, holistically build and land and execute and impact.

376
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.510
Ivylevel: And the reason was because they worked on it on a yearly basis. And I'll be very honest.

377
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:49.640
Ivylevel: This is where the weekly execution comes in handy

378
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:57.749
Ivylevel: where? Okay, this is the idea. Now, even defining the project right? We all have an ideation concept. And you know, this year from the tech industry, I'm from the tech industry.

379
00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:05.689
Ivylevel: We start with a very good brilliant idea, and you know, like, thanks a lot for acknowledging. And we hear that all the time, where people actually parents might have not even heard the framework.

380
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:13.840
Ivylevel: Now 3 weeks, 4 weeks. There areunt number of boot camps for passion projects. I can. I can share you because I've I've been a victor myself.

381
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.430
Ajay: Okay. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt. I need to. She has to go for a developer.

382
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:21.120
Ivylevel: Yeah, I'm fine. I mean, we can. We can wrap up. That's fine, you know. I can keep talking.

383
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.040
Ajay: No, no, no, you scored. Go ahead. I have to leave. Yeah.

384
00:54:24.274 --> 00:54:30.140
Ivylevel: Thank you very much. Yeah, because I I think this is the opportunity. Right? Because I think I'll I'll tell you like, what happens is.

385
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:39.190
Ivylevel: This is actually and by the way, Jenny, if you're running late, you know you're free. I can actually just continue with yeah, please feel free to like, you know, create an additional things.

386
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.900
Ajay: And up.

387
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.559
Ivylevel: Don't be shy.

388
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:54.250
Ajay: One thing I wanted to ask, Jenny. I was very curious. What's her passion of doing this? Yes, she is still working on her graduation. I think I was kind of thinking of. I mean, she is in China. She is

389
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:57.589
Ajay: being here just wanted to understand, like in one.

390
00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:00.390
Ajay: Briefly, what's your passion?

391
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:18.750
Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I've actually really been passionate about coaching and mentoring for a very, very long time ever before I first started doing it professionally. I always help students. Like, I posted a lot of resources on social media. I made Youtube videos talking about college application advice I talk about. I made tick talk

392
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:39.850
Jenny Duan: and I think for me, the biggest thing is, I think, that this is such an industry, where information is get kept to an extreme where only people who have gone through the process really understand the extent of the strategies. And I also think college admissions is a game. I don't think that. I think it's a system where, if you know how to the strategies, you can win. But if you don't know, it's

393
00:55:39.850 --> 00:56:09.220
Jenny Duan: very, very hard to break that mold, and that's why legacy students do so. Well. That's why people with families who have gone to Ivy League elite institutions. That's why they do so well, because if you have more knowledge, it's easier to understand the system. And that's why I think a lot of the most smart students are actually left behind in this process, and I think it's very unfair. I think the college system is very unfair. And I really wanna do my best to increase the amount of information out there, so that everyone who

394
00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.026
Jenny Duan: I think

395
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:39.129
Jenny Duan: is qualified can make it regardless of their circumstances. So that's really my goal. Why I do mentoring specifically is because I find it very personally rewarding to see students success, and to be able to see like a personal transformation. I think college mentorship is is not just about getting into a good college. I think. Obviously that's important. But I think what's more valuable for me is seeing students. Confidence grow over time, seeing them really discover their passions, their interest, and to see them like

396
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:46.110
Jenny Duan: grow into more of a leader over time like. And I and I really enjoy watching that process. So that's that's why I do this.

397
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.899
Ajay: Thank you. Thank you.

398
00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:49.240
Ajay: Thanks. Yeah, yeah.

399
00:56:49.445 --> 00:56:50.680
Jenny Duan: I'm gonna pop off now, but.

400
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.729
Ivylevel: And the phone.

401
00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:53.919
Jenny Duan: Feel free to Sir.

402
00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:21.509
Ivylevel: No, I think. And that's the thing right. You know, it's only people like Jenny who actually can help make this happen as well. So I think it's really the the quality of the coach who are passionate about it, and our entire team is built on that. That's why, you know, you cannot drive the same result, you know, by just building a platform. It cannot be technology play. So I think, and we have built a model like that right? So again, I don't want to take away the passion and commitment, but I think our success has been in really being able to identify people like Jenny, and I think

403
00:57:21.743 --> 00:57:31.330
Ivylevel: that is why we are a team and the framework and the process. And Jenny has delivered a lot of outcomes and many other coaches have delivered outcomes right. And that is why we it comes to us because

404
00:57:31.785 --> 00:57:38.679
Ivylevel: I think one is the gate kept strategy, but also, like, think about, I'll be very blunt and honest, right? What she was talking about. Strategy.

405
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:47.989
Ivylevel: how many of the Cs students actually, who are actually studying Stanford. They actually might be, you know, you can close your ears. They came in through.

406
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:53.669
Ivylevel: you know, gender education and sex education kind of a major, and they're doing Cs right now.

407
00:57:54.300 --> 00:58:24.040
Ivylevel: How many there are things that people don't talk about, right, not everyone gets in. And this is where I think the problem with a very competitive kind of type. Parents coming from the especially like you and me like coming from that. I'll talk a bit to background where we think that. Okay, let's keep doing more. Unfortunately, when they come late, they don't figure they don't realize the gender identity. The school they went to like that's actually can be prohibitive. Right? So then, it's not to say that the expectation are high. If you know, if if are. I was studying in a private school.

408
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:48.069
Ivylevel: The bar is also high because you have access to those resources. Correct. And then you have someone actually studying in like an East base school, their access to resources. The way it is very contextual. So we need to plan like how the good thing is that definitely, he's gonna learn more. He's gonna do great in his life, you know, there is so much benefit of private and absolutely for private. But again, it is a game. So if you don't play smartly early on

409
00:58:48.080 --> 00:59:13.379
Ivylevel: and pick the right things to execute upon what happens is lot of stress kids. UN, you know. Unfortunately, the stress of compare Number One. The biggest prohibitive thing is comparison. Think about it, and we parents don't do a good job, and I am guilty about that as well right? Because I don't know the game. So I'm always thinking about. 015-60-1580. Ask Jenny. We have students who get 1560 and still want to go to start to get a 1,600. Why? Because her friend did it

410
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:21.430
Ivylevel: absolutely the wrong way to think about it, like, you know. And this is where it is the 80 20 rule where you guide and you make an impact.

411
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:45.529
Ivylevel: So yeah, I mean, Jenny, feel free. Right. I mean, I just wanted to. I I think a reason why it's important is this is the moment where it's important for me as a parent to kind of just share, like, you know. Thanks, Jenny, have wonderful data, please, you know. Write the report if you can. Yeah. So the only reason I'm saying, this is very simple, right? I you know, number one like this basic service. The only reason I've kept it

412
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:55.909
Ivylevel: is just to show parents and not tell. That's it. Like, you know, the thing is okay, and my success rate with this particular conversion has been near 100. I would say, probably one or 2 cases right?

413
00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:05.089
Ivylevel: And and also we have really like we were able to end the final essay services on the college app, where I told you where the pool is. So

414
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:09.282
Ivylevel: this is again. The only reason I'm saying is like,

415
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:17.879
Ivylevel: you know, if you are really serious about this kind of journey prep journey. Right? I'm I'm just giving like more on how

416
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:42.509
Ivylevel: a wrong summer is gonna be spent. The same effort and impact. And I did that. And I'm just telling parents when they come to me that you know it's up to you, because I know at the end of the day. I'm a parent. I have. You know, my my daughter. Like older daughter. I sent her to 2 2 summer programs. I will do it because for me it's very easy to swipe card, and then for me the best thing is like, you know, why should my child be left out? If everyone is going to an upper, you know. An AI program. Thanks.

417
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:48.090
Ajay: Hi, welcome. Yeah, he has some reports today.

418
01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:48.700
Ivylevel: Yeah.

419
01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:56.419
Ivylevel: Yeah. So I think, see, first thing is really for me to show the value. And then at the end of the day is really for parents first to like.

420
01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:03.739
Ivylevel: I think, whether you sign up or not, for the long term is perfectly fine, but I also want to prevent parents from not doing the wrong things.

421
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:13.019
Ivylevel: you know. And and this is where? Because we have that kind of heard mentality right? We are all in the fear, the the biggest 2 drivers of purchase. Right? And you know that you're an exec yourself.

422
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.770
Ivylevel: It's fear of missing out

423
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.250
Ivylevel: in the wrong things.

424
01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:21.910
Ivylevel: and really just comparing on the wrong things as well like you're just comparing. And you're seeing and very contextual, right?

425
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:39.349
Ivylevel: But it does not drive the result. The the simple thing is, we have to think different. We have to think, do things that are different that are unique, because at the end of the day. The the way they're looking at it is like, you know. Oh, not one more Indian guy, you know, coming from Bay Area of a tech. Exec, you know, coming with another stem profile and doing another. AI!

426
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:46.019
Ivylevel: AI is become like a throw, you know. Buzz word. Now everyone wants to throw anything you do is an AI like, you know. Is it going to help?

427
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:54.600
Ivylevel: I think impact is where I'm telling you big. And I showed you Rishi's profile and stuff like that. The brilliant students, you know, 3.8 Gpa. He doesn't have an award.

428
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.089
Ivylevel: How does he get in?

429
01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:01.900
Ivylevel: Is you have the admission officers eventually telling how many people actually have that kind of a unique profile

430
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.330
Ivylevel: and impact.

431
01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:09.879
Ivylevel: And you know, like, just in the previous call, right? We were actually discussing about some extracurricular ideas and things like that where

432
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:14.060
Ivylevel: the guy just a profile. I'm just telling you, like, you know, Cs and business.

433
01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:23.019
Ivylevel: plus they're actually from Christian Valley, you know. Again, the very similar week we had like 2 people I told you so. They are, you know, business and Cs.

434
01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:39.379
Ivylevel: and he's also passionate about tennis. But now we are actually defining a extra curricular project for him to basically work with the the Cam Detention Center people in Detention Center on, how can you use actually use cyber security? He wants to do cyber security as well.

435
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:46.200
Ivylevel: How can you build something that actually benefits that. So you're kind of weaving this from early on. And I'll tell you where the problem is.

436
01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:50.510
Ivylevel: The problem is, our kids are able to execute and build. They are in the build mode.

437
01:02:50.590 --> 01:03:00.889
Ivylevel: You keep building, you build, keep building in vacuum. Nothing happens. You know. What happens is the people. When I look at these profile. A lot of them are celebrated. They have done search engine optimization. They had publicists.

438
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:12.259
Ivylevel: They had. You need to work on framing, packaging, marketing. You need to reach out to newspapers. You need to make noise and look at Harker school. Right? They have publicity, and they're able to help. But again, not everyone is able to do

439
01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:30.380
Ivylevel: so. It is actually a very. It's very hard for me, because it is a qualitative aspect. Right? So parents are very easy for me to converse like, okay, join our program. Now, if your child works for 2 years, they will get a 1,600 and sat. They will keep spending and keep spending and keep spending because it's quantitative.

440
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:48.989
Ivylevel: What they don't understand eventually is the extra curricular is what actually makes the biggest difference. Look at the top recommendation. Jenny wrote down Brainstorm first about the extra curricular. It's not even about the curriculum, because that is the easy part, and someone as brilliant as you know. Rf, I have no doubts right? He's got a great school. He's gonna learn academics and all that.

441
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.850
Ivylevel: But again, he's again gonna be with another all of those clubs. How is he gonna stand out?

442
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.290
Ivylevel: So I think the way you stand out is build something very unique

443
01:03:57.590 --> 01:04:12.959
Ivylevel: I did, and and and also passions right just imagine, like how many passions in one session you start working. And for the previous student, he, we did not know. We ended up actually, now, work after we started with cyber security. Then he basically said that my dad is cyber security. That's why I like it.

444
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:19.169
Ivylevel: And then we started this jenny asked more and more, and then finally, it turns out that he's actually very interested in Astro.

445
01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:29.450
Ivylevel: So I think this is a framework that you need to apply, but, more importantly, very tactical help on a on a week by weeks. And I've shown you right all those things. So

446
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:35.269
Ivylevel: yeah. So first thing is like, you know. I I would say that, you know it's a long term plan.

447
01:04:35.575 --> 01:04:47.710
Ivylevel: Having a coach work with them. And you know, driving result. And you know, getting into these programs like mit launches or getting into there are students who are working on. And and the good thing is, once you have a passion project.

448
01:04:47.780 --> 01:05:03.450
Ivylevel: you can get the credit, the the accreditation and attestation from different places. Either. You get to a ticket to an Iv program. You kind of reuse that. But lot of work actually happens in writing that essay writing that because you are taking a passion project.

449
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:19.820
Ivylevel: Either you're scaling the impact to social channel and media and marketing and publicity. That's one area. One data point to prove that you have done an impact. The other data point is to go to a very highly accredited free program which is very highly competitive. So the only data, the metric that matters there is. Oh.

450
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:26.049
Ivylevel: there are certain programs that are even more competitive than getting into Harvard and Stanford. So you see, I got into a program.

451
01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:43.399
Ivylevel: you know, like my, I'm telling my daughter. My daughter got into 2 programs. One she won the National Award. Now. She got selected into the top journal. It's not even publicly known yet. They have asked her. She she got selected 30 students they selected in the entire country. It's got a 6% as a journalist Jcam.

452
01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:50.110
Ivylevel: She's not a journalist, she is a game developer. But the reason why you need a journalism because of the advocacy.

453
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:57.699
Ivylevel: but she was selected by Cnn. Nbc. Like those kind of celebrity judges, they selected 30 students in the entire country.

454
01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:07.119
Ivylevel: So now what happens is her advocacy gets an attestation. Her national award in computing gets her an attestation, and I don't know where she lands tomorrow. But her profile is not strong.

455
01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:13.629
Ivylevel: And she's actually. And then you're weaving it. So bit by bit, you have to target these things. And this is actually the hard work, right?

456
01:06:14.154 --> 01:06:19.485
Ivylevel: And you know, everything is like a mini college application. So

457
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:21.100
Ivylevel: yeah.

458
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:29.539
Ivylevel: I think it's iterative, right? It's like plan. Every week. This is our model. I said, okay, I said, Okay, what would be our kind of a process framework? You plan.

459
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:32.000
Ivylevel: you execute.

460
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:39.280
Ivylevel: Sorry you assess everything we do. Listen to assess. Then you plan, you execute end of the week, you have a check-in.

461
01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:54.439
Ivylevel: and then you basically kind of reflect what is gone, you measure, and then you reassess, and then you do again, and every circle every week it basically changes. So I think I'll I'll let you basically decide. But I I also want to make sure that

462
01:06:54.710 --> 01:07:11.759
Ivylevel: you know this QA. Is not the thing that I'm looking at. I'm I'm really about execution we want, and that is where the unmet need is. And then, you know, it's too late, you know. You know, even like, you know, sophomore year and freshman year, you know freshman is a good time, I would say. The last effort, like, you know, you should start by freshman

463
01:07:12.101 --> 01:07:20.819
Ivylevel: but you know, for example, he gets an advantage if he can really identify a resource. So I I now have a request connection with 2 Uci professors.

464
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.700
Ivylevel: Uc. Irwine, and you know also, Uc. Berkeley.

465
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:31.779
Ivylevel: Now, we are basically, we have our students, and we are trying to help them connect to these professors to get them a research project.

466
01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:35.149
Ivylevel: But you see now, how do I quantify that

467
01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:41.980
Ivylevel: that requires work? You have to frame? You have to target. You have to use your relationships and your network to get in.

468
01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:48.250
Ivylevel: But what happens is it's much more easy to do a one click checkout right? There are hundreds of

469
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:58.839
Ivylevel: scammers out there who are going to sell you a research project for $7,000 every. We have. Like so many profiles who come. They go to the same shop, and they publish a research paper same journal.

470
01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:03.569
Ivylevel: So you know. So I think that's the thing. It has to be unique. It has to have an impact.

471
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:20.540
Ivylevel: And we should make. Of course we should make nods. I think marketing is very important. Publicity is very important. You have to put these weves right, these things. And I'm telling you that our students have put trackers in there. They know that, you know. During that mission time or Stanford Professor came. He looked at my video. He spent 5 min on it.

472
01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:33.270
Ivylevel: The so we have data to prove on how the portfolio. I'll show you some portfolios of our students. You will be blown away like last year. We have one who went to a early decision. Who got into Stanford, Astro.

473
01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:59.599
Ivylevel: Victoria Tan. Actually, from one of the competitive school from New York. Actually, News, New York, New York, New England, is top schools right? And her pro, her profile and portfolio will be honest, right like Ju, just the way like, you know, working for years on building your kind of music kind of the portfolio supplemental, because now the thing is like we know the end right game. So we are anything that we are choosing here. We are always trying to say what will give you the best return of investment eventually.

474
01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:01.589
Ivylevel: And if these are small decisions.

475
01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:14.999
Ivylevel: right? So that's it. So let me know. I mean honestly, I'm more than happy to give it. But I also don't want to lose the momentum. You know, if you're really interested, what it means is you're really signing up your son with a team of you know Stanford coaches

476
01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:18.230
Ivylevel: who have been there done that, and I can tell you that.

477
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:29.520
Ivylevel: In fact, I I know that you asked Jenny for the passion, but also, like, you know, the thing that we have cracked is really, how do you incentivize and keep them like? Where even a person like Jenny, who's on the road is able to attend 2 back to back calls.

478
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:35.299
Ivylevel: So they have. They have. They've seen the success. They've seen the growth. They've co-created something new.

479
01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:42.570
Ivylevel: and they have. They're vested in my company, right? They have. They are part of the team there that she's a founding. Pm, so I think the way I've built it is.

480
01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:47.699
Ivylevel: that is one of the risk I have right like, how do I make make sure that I've got the best coaches.

481
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:54.929
Ivylevel: and that's why recruiting and incentivizing every bit of their behavior is being driven by incentives.

482
01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:06.840
Ivylevel: If they get an outcome. If they help one of the people get like a national, a level award. Get into a top. Iv like, you know, they get 5,000. 3,000. 4,000. It's a very tiered performance.

483
01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:27.120
Ivylevel: and they help someone get into an Iv school. They get $10,000. So I've I've built something very, very contractual where they are committed, and they my goal is really not to let like people like Jenny go and work for $25, you know, in a you know. Summer camp. You know, for example, like in a Starbucks. So yeah, I'm more than happy.

484
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:53.119
Ivylevel: Honestly, that's why I'm a bit hesitant to actually, you know, offer the services to kind of middle schoolers, because I think there's no Russian urgency. So what happens is we are able to de deliver a lot of value. But then, you know there's always this kind of or you know, might be this. There's a better time to start. I. My, my view is like this, like, I have 8 graders who actually go. And I'm telling that. Okay, let's plan on the foundational kind of Projects Fashion Project.

485
01:10:53.220 --> 01:11:17.299
Ivylevel: Let's identify a research project for him. Let's have someone work with him. Why can't we have him get into one of the top competitions in ninth grade and freshmen and win it. Right? So think of it like that that you start building it. You're building it already, just like you're sending your child to academics and other things. You are basically having a private, very individualized support for extra curriculars which is actually going to be the biggest outcome driver.

486
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:26.609
Ivylevel: So anyways, I think I I don't want to be more pushy, but I I want to make sure that you know my intention behind offering the service is really to help you see it.

487
01:11:27.012 --> 01:11:29.619
Ivylevel: And then, you know, decide accordingly.

488
01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.299
Ajay: So a few questions. Siraj. If it's okay.

489
01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:34.140
Ivylevel: Yeah.

490
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:50.270
Ajay: So you you talk about Stanford. Go! But this is across all the colleges. Right? Be just, Stanford, are the people you're just hiding, but they have experience of how do we get into any other? Iv, if it's not just Stanford correct, or any other top schools?

491
01:11:51.157 --> 01:11:59.321
Ajay: Right? Okay. And you talked about something like, for example, there are this hackers, or there are people who

492
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.729
Ajay: help with publications or how to publish stuff.

493
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:05.350
Ajay: And there are other

494
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:20.449
Ajay: services which for higher cost, does that? Are you saying that you are also kind of doing that here as part of this package which which other are not doing, and in a way helping people helping in that kind of publications of those.

495
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:23.320
Ajay: the research.

496
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:28.959
Ivylevel: E, exactly. See, I think the the the thing I'm trying to tell you is

497
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:48.229
Ivylevel: number one. Yeah, we are only doing ethical work right number one. So there's nothing like where there is a lot of unethical stuff that happens. I've even posted on Linkedin, on how a parent came to me and asked me that I'm going to pay you $30,000. Please have your from Korea right when you when you do business in this space. I never thought there's a lot of grey area here.

498
01:12:48.836 --> 01:12:52.320
Ivylevel: But the thing about what I was trying to mention is

499
01:12:53.167 --> 01:13:02.990
Ivylevel: doing a research project with a shop who guarantees like, you know. 2 months summer program come and we'll publish something. And then I have 3, 4 profile coming from the same shop.

500
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:07.849
Ivylevel: You think that is actually going to give you validity? No, it's a red flag, same thing with boot camps.

501
01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:14.770
Ivylevel: I will. I will show you, and you can ask. You know, I think one of the words that is actually a taboo in our team is a inspirate AI.

502
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:23.830
Ivylevel: Last year there was something called in spirit. AI, every every student coming from Bay Area. What did you do? The summer in spirit? AI and spirit. AI mit students

503
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:27.190
Ivylevel: see? That is why it's very easy to be honest.

504
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:47.000
Ivylevel: I I'll tell you, Brutio, as I have many friends in a tech who are running upscaling programs now for corporate, and they told me that the brutal reality, product, faculty, everything else like, you know, he's my friend. Actually, he's done that. He's telling me that the brutal reality is, have an upscaling program. No quality, nothing you can. It's so repeatable it's scalable. You will just make money till end of times.

505
01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:53.549
Ivylevel: The reality is getting outcomes is hard. So to answer your question, of course. But what do we want to do?

506
01:13:53.590 --> 01:14:04.190
Ivylevel: We want to like? Look at the recommendations I can bring up. We have identified Rsi, Ssp, we are looking at ticket to Iv kind of competitions we are keeping in mind

507
01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:12.359
Ivylevel: that we want him to, and we want to do it through home, through, Professor. I want your child to do so now with Arnold.

508
01:14:13.007 --> 01:14:20.440
Ivylevel: You know who's actually Monta Vista. He's going to do a research on climate change this summer with a Uc. Berkeley professor.

509
01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:40.849
Ivylevel: I I want to be very transparent with you like let me let me show you like. I I want to be very transparent, so that because, you know, at the end of the day, when I'm not marketing or anything else. And it's also a very high kind of privacy kind of service, you know. It's a edge service. The only thing I can do is I can basically show my parents.

510
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:46.370
Ivylevel: you know, transparently like what goes behind. Right? So

511
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:53.760
Ivylevel: see?

512
01:14:54.130 --> 01:15:01.539
Ivylevel: So this is actually one of my this is actually one of my design coaches. Right? I do have a team of specialists. That's the way I think about it.

513
01:15:01.959 --> 01:15:11.649
Ivylevel: I do have, you know, different type of coaches. So I wanted to give you an idea. So basically, what happens again? Right? So she's already having one student. But she's doing a design major.

514
01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:27.489
Ivylevel: And parents come to me. And they suddenly ask like, and you know, all rightfully, for example. So parents come and parents basically say that, oh, yeah. But we don't want design, you know, very major oriented. What they forget is, everyone in the high school

515
01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:50.060
Ivylevel: basically did many things they don't. They don't understand. And she actually did not even enter as design. She entered, as you know, one of the community kind of projects public policy or kind of program she entered into. Now, now she switch into this. So she's basically attending. And she's telling me your parents are asking me, you know. Tell them that I'm actually on the AI track. So more adjacent to Cs because there is a fixation about Cs right? We come from.

516
01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:56.459
Ivylevel: Then look at this, that that she also specializes in community service projects. So she's telling me, basically.

517
01:15:56.470 --> 01:16:03.939
Ivylevel: right? So you know, if you can. And she got a perfect score in act. So think about how holistically this candidate is.

518
01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:26.089
Ivylevel: Now that is why I'm a team. She's already working with Ryan, you know, as an example that, you know, helping him. Basically position you know and define this whole. We are having 2 coaches for the student son of a Vp. Microsoft, you know, from Seattle as an example. Then I will show you one more thing to your point. What is the second question? Yeah, on the research right?

519
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:36.109
Ajay: Yeah, the the publication you you mentioned. I was not aware that Harker helps people with publication and making marketing on their research papers.

520
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:42.458
Ivylevel: Yeah, yeah, I I mean, I see. I I'll I'll tell you like you know marketing, I I mean, I'll I'll just tell you like

521
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:52.579
Ivylevel: Now my my daughter is working with Rishi, so Jenny is my daughter's primary coach, but I have a secondary coach now, helping my daughter just to market and publicize, and I'll show you. She already got.

522
01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:53.090
Ajay: And very.

523
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:58.230
Ivylevel: Going to publish, you know, a few news articles. And she got into journalism. You need that because.

524
01:16:58.726 --> 01:17:02.029
Ivylevel: okay, one more thing for just for the research I want to show you.

525
01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.219
Ivylevel: The way we work

526
01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:05.905
Ivylevel: is,

527
01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:11.510
Ivylevel: yeah. So

528
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:34.080
Ivylevel: okay, see this. Now. So Rishi basically comes, hey, I have a Uci professor now who wants to do a research? If you have a lead, tell me which is a good student. We discuss a few students. Then he says, No, no, you know, actually, Arian is not a good fit. Actually, one of the students ninth grader. He's because he's not very good in math.

529
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:49.860
Ivylevel: So now he's telling. Okay, let's go with that Monte Vista student. But Montavista student is already doing climate change. I'm telling him that you know Berkeley. So the way I'm so the way, see, you have the 1 one thing that people don't understand, there's a lot that happens behind the scene that students don't know

530
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:54.780
Ivylevel: and then I will show you the publicity. That my daughter is working on

531
01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:21.269
Ivylevel: and trust me. My daughter has been working on a passion project for how many like 2 years? 3 years! Right a. And she got a national award on that passion project just on the Passion project. So you have a national, and you know I told you my daughter got in apple intention because of that she's doing as a high schooler she's doing. I'm an ex apple. But I did not use any influence, but she's getting be. So the thing is the the way is, you have to. Actually.

532
01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:24.730
Ivylevel: yeah.

533
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:43.780
Ivylevel: see, they just started. I actually asked him, even though, even though Jenny is been doing 2 years now, they are working on this entire publicity. So his goal. And very confidentially, I'm sharing, because, you know, I don't want my daughter to miss out. It's part of the game.

534
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.200
Ivylevel: so they have they just kicked it off?

535
01:18:46.970 --> 01:19:08.110
Ivylevel: He's actually now going to help her make a crunch based profile. Make a help in Imdb because my daughter is the president of Vfx Club in her school. So she did. A videographer is her passion. So in Imdb, my daughter is, gonna put it like, think about it like, though, that's the level that's happening. So you know, storyboarding that all this stuff she's gonna write all these action items. This is one week

536
01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:15.699
Ivylevel: my daughter is working on all this now, trying to build her profile right look at this, Victoria. 10 our last year student.

537
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:22.550
Ivylevel: and I'll tell you one thing. You know, that the community that has really cracked this. I've told this again as well

538
01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:27.270
Ivylevel: are really Southeast Asians. And you know, East Asians.

539
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:31.420
Ivylevel: So this is Victoria Tan. She came to us. We did entire work.

540
01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:36.217
Ivylevel: And yeah, she made it into Stanford, and

541
01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.949
Ivylevel: she made it into Stanford early decision.

542
01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:45.490
Ivylevel: Of course she got a lot of credentials. Look at her profile right? She is now a violinist, and this is what

543
01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:51.979
Ivylevel: you know. These things take 2 years to build, and they are. She has all that but her narrative, her portfolio about me

544
01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:57.989
Ivylevel: is that music? Writing 3 things? You know the aptitude and the passion and the community impact.

545
01:19:58.676 --> 01:20:09.749
Ivylevel: Science research. She went into research, published a paper. She founded her thing again. Everything aligns with one team. You need to have one central theme. It is about viewing something which is one spike.

546
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:12.430
Ivylevel: See, our community impact is around Astro.

547
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:14.590
Ivylevel: Her research is around Astro

548
01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:16.960
Ivylevel: and even the community impact.

549
01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:18.210
Ivylevel: But

550
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:28.549
Ivylevel: there was a publicist to actually help doing this like, look at this. This is this, is not. This is actually, I I remember I told you first time that we actually, if we know the kind of branding that's happening

551
01:20:29.286 --> 01:20:36.159
Ivylevel: you'll be surprised, because what happens is admission officers do at the end of the day they do a quick check after admission. Reviewers.

552
01:20:36.906 --> 01:20:38.120
Ivylevel: You know

553
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:40.210
Ivylevel: everything. Now look at it.

554
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:47.990
Ivylevel: This is all. It takes time. It it takes lot of time, I'm telling you right. And and this is where the advantage difference is.

555
01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:49.760
Ajay: Got it.

556
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:57.729
Ajay: So, Bobby, how do you have a people join Ivs in computer science as well? You have. You have them getting to computer sciences as well.

557
01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:04.540
Ivylevel: So I think we are really not. We are not. See, that is fundamentally the reason.

558
01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:14.510
Ivylevel: When parents come to us, when we look at the profile, and especially if it is an Indian student, they've got into data science. And so we always look at a non Cs route to get in.

559
01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:20.720
Ivylevel: We got one student who got into Cs. But he went to Uc. Berkeley as a environmental science.

560
01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:32.079
Ivylevel: You have to be smart, though. Same thing for my daughter, you know, with my daughter now, because of her profile, and she's a very Diehard game developer. And again, see, I'm we are not playing it nasty

561
01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.250
Ivylevel: of

562
01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.600
Ivylevel: game development. Mit has a great program. Now.

563
01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:52.190
Ivylevel: see, she's developing games like she's a software engineer already, I know, like she's one hackathons, and she's been doing this like I don't want Cs is not the only way for her to succeed. There is that kind of perception and brand where you know. Of course, you know Cs probably has a slight edge. But to be very honest

564
01:21:52.240 --> 01:22:03.259
Ivylevel: now, with AI and everything else, and humanities and liberal arts, you know, the opportunities like, look at Jenny. She got apple intenship. She did not go to Apple. She's going to d shop. She's symbolic system.

565
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:10.620
Ivylevel: Jenny is actually symbolic system. As an example like that is actually a mix of 3 things, Cs, AI and psychology and philosophy. 4 majors.

566
01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:23.580
Ivylevel: It's an interdisciplinary program. So the thing is, if you just go with Cs, the problem with Cs is this, mainly because of the Asian population coming from that background, we only apply to 3 things. Cs, Econ, bio bio.

567
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.890
Ivylevel: Everyone comes there.

568
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:37.879
Ivylevel: Of course you are going to have the least acceptance, because you are another Indian guy applying to the same thing. So what is a smarter way of think about? And and you know this whole strategy is is is what you have to start early on

569
01:22:37.890 --> 01:23:00.329
Ivylevel: if we are targeting a few colleges which will learn. So the way, okay, if you want to go to Uc, then we are going to target. Uc. Professors help you get work there. So the thing is, we just cannot. You know, we can easily have. You know, I've got all experts. I've got neuro research experts. I've got biomed coaches. We are helping. Biomed engineering is another very popular one. We are doing that. But

570
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:08.290
Ivylevel: the thing is all I'm saying. We are anti that because our students know it like just the way, Jenny, right? They know what does not work anymore.

571
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:18.490
Ivylevel: The thing that does not work anymore is the paid kind of programs. So you have to basically try to find areas where you're not able to establish a paid element, a privilege element.

572
01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:23.630
Ivylevel: a neurologist's son actually got it to Emery. He worked with us last year.

573
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:30.220
Ivylevel: So neurologist son worked with a Stanford research student in Europe.

574
01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:41.270
Ivylevel: The reason he sent here was he wanted to have far away connection across the border, working with Stanford. Even Stanford was not not his Ring school. The only reason I'm saying Stanford is.

575
01:23:41.520 --> 01:24:03.090
Ivylevel: It's my product strategy, basically, that I don't. I? I do have Howard and Mit still want to join. But my products are very similar. These people have gotten into once they get into Stanford, there is high chances they've got. Like all my coaches. Literally, they've got into Ucs. They've got into you know. Howard Stanford Mit. And they chose Stanford over. See, Stanford is like the apple and the Iv plus right?

576
01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:06.890
Ivylevel: So it has its own space. So I wanted to create that premium around that.

577
01:24:07.311 --> 01:24:11.676
Ivylevel: But no, you're absolutely yeah. App just to clarify. Right? So it's it's everything.

578
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:17.359
Ajay: So what you what you're saying was eventually they can go work for companies

579
01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:21.530
Ajay: with whether you have Cs background or you get into Cs major.

580
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:27.700
Ajay: but you, we are going through that through a non Cs route, but eventually they'll be doing the same thing.

581
01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:35.019
Ivylevel: Yeah. In fact, the the thing I was trying to tell you is that the people who are pursuing Stanford Cs today. Okay, 2 things here, right?

582
01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:43.410
Ivylevel: The private schools and public schools have a big difference. And and you know this, I mean, you are an Exec. You know this because funding at the end of the day. There's no funding.

583
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.290
Ivylevel: Uc. I'm talking about Uc. Berkeley and Ucla.

584
01:24:46.510 --> 01:25:06.360
Ivylevel: Th. There is absolutely no funding. Just talk to a Uc. Berkeley. We. We just had one student from Ucla who's trying to do a transfer to Stanford. We help her in the transfer application she got into already. Cornell last year. 4 years they've given her a free pass. She also applied to Upenn hopefully. She'll get into Upen. Stanford is hard to get in. Only 20 people transfer

585
01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:18.580
Ivylevel: the problem she was telling. She doesn't want. She got into Berkeley. She got into La. But now she wants to transfer. You know why, she said, that in Ucla to get connected to a research professor, I have to stand in line for 20 min. Same issue public school.

586
01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:21.120
Ivylevel: Why you're sending your child to a private school.

587
01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:27.229
Ivylevel: The thing with good thing about private schools is this, why, ib plus? Because they do not have a cap.

588
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:29.629
Ivylevel: So what they do is

589
01:25:30.049 --> 01:25:41.910
Ivylevel: you come in through. They do have a very acceptance lot of people still end up applying to Cs. So the acceptance rate is always low because the volume is high, the volume is high. Of course the acceptance rate will be low.

590
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.239
Ivylevel: So what you do is you go through

591
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:52.859
Ivylevel: like, even like I think it's it's one of the worst. We don't want to do that data, science, social science very easy. There are paths to get in.

592
01:25:53.030 --> 01:26:04.629
Ivylevel: People are getting through general education and sex education. Right? That's what I said. There are majors that are coming up which are not competitive or sustainability. As an example, you try to get in, then you start to move.

593
01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:14.239
Ivylevel: In fact, it's much harder to switch in the public school as an example like Uc. Berkeley and Ucla, because they have, like many capped, they do capping because they don't have enough.

594
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:34.769
Ivylevel: So yes, I think. But but you see these things. What happens is, parents will spend money at the last year. I have many seniors, but it's already too late. What can I do now. I have shrinid and some path, you know, coming from Berkeley. He works at Dod. His daughter wants to go to Nsa. Amazing daughter! Right from both from Tamila do. They're amazing like

595
01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.160
Ivylevel: he's come to me. We are helping her. She did. Nero, brother is an autistic person.

596
01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:47.529
Ivylevel: She wanted to do Nero. But now parents want her to do data science. They want her to get into data science. She wants to work in 4 and 6. She wants to get into Nsa.

597
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:53.300
Ivylevel: She has no experience on Nsa, sorry software. And you know, data science, anything.

598
01:26:53.630 --> 01:27:01.580
Ivylevel: So now in one month they joined February, I'll show you. In one month we help them bring up, spin off a passion project.

599
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:04.260
Ivylevel: What we did start

600
01:27:04.330 --> 01:27:09.840
Ivylevel: data science right? Start making a platform to help other parents who have autistic kids

601
01:27:10.210 --> 01:27:22.090
Ivylevel: start using data science, you know, data start doing data visualization. With that, let's start, you know, showing a data, helpful information. And let's start writing a blog to market it.

602
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:34.520
Ivylevel: Let's take it to the legislation. See? What you have to do is this, I'll show you profiles of our our students. I showed you, Rishi, last time might be. It makes sense more sense. Now, one thing is just doing the the exciting world of building.

603
01:27:35.284 --> 01:27:58.529
Ivylevel: And what did Rishi do? I? I showed you as an example. In fact, Rishi will be a good coach in my mind if you were thinking about. You know a. A. Rf. Because number one he has. He's Cs at Stanford. He has done all his high school projects on cyber security, and he has done projects on you know, entrepreneurship business. He's built a business which actually generated 63,000 revenue.

604
01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:17.449
Ivylevel: all Ucr wine, competitive public school, but Uc. R. Wine, and most importantly now is he is a Pr. Master. Like campaigning Pring. He made his published his article right from Sophomore. Very simple business. He did take that old phones resell it $300 premium, repair it. But the story was

605
01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.110
Ivylevel: everything he was doing. Number one evist.

606
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:22.880
Ivylevel: He. The story became about sustainability.

607
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:33.889
Ivylevel: So we are basically recycling the iphones from home, and we are creating money. But to reduce e waste. And he took it to the right to repair your own phone to the legislation in the city Council.

608
01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:44.509
Ivylevel: See this effort? I'm telling you only the people who are bookish and learning and just doing checklist will never do this. They will never have this impact because it takes

609
01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:46.470
Ivylevel: months and years to doing it.

610
01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:51.100
Ivylevel: building relationships, going and showing up in city council, speaking up.

611
01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:59.209
Ivylevel: driving change. They want change makers, right? These even Uc. Berkeley. They want change makers, and our kids, unfortunately, are not able to show the impact.

612
01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:05.650
Ivylevel: So I think this is what actually, if I were to really just focus and tell you that. Okay, I can promise you 2 things.

613
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:07.940
Ivylevel: It will be this right?

614
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:16.449
Ivylevel: I can tell you that our goal will be really to help. You know, students, that we're doing really have high impact items, passion project research

615
01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.159
Ivylevel: have it completely published and publicized

616
01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:20.850
Ivylevel: hand hold them.

617
01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.380
Ivylevel: I think we are going to hand over to them, because.

618
01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:28.080
Ivylevel: like, I don't know like, you know, of course, Arab is a great guy, but I don't know. How

619
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:45.680
Ivylevel: is he like a social media guy? Does he know how to market things does he know to make an impact? Can he go? And and and this is where you know they work with a coach like, look at Daishi. My daughter is a shy girl. She has an amazing, she's built an amazing product. I mean, you can see, like she's teaching AI ethics through her gaming.

620
01:29:46.141 --> 01:30:00.259
Ivylevel: Amazing program game she's made. But the problem is, she doesn't have enough traffic to her site to her social channel. And there is no noise when I open Victoria 10, Victoria 10 has, like, you know, 3 articles already published up to her in tenth grade, eleventh grade.

621
01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:05.840
Ivylevel: I just do me a quick exercise. Right? Go and just do Harker school, like, you know, school students, they will publish everything

622
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:10.139
Ivylevel: this award school will publish. Oh, our kids have won 3 award for award.

623
01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:19.060
Ivylevel: So now we are gonna work on search engine optimization. I'm sorry. But this is unfortunately how the game is played I mean you and and a lot of things happen.

624
01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.719
Ivylevel: but you know this is where the execution takes

625
01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:44.170
Ivylevel: and and that's why, I I don't have you know, like, Oh, my! My yearly program, I tell parents is like, my job is really to have a commitment from a coach, because I have a yearly, and I'm be very transparent on how. How I'm building this right? You can imagine that with the biggest risk for me as a as a founder, as a startup is my coach quality, and retaining them and making sure they are reliable

626
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:49.629
Ivylevel: by reliability of service and making sure. So the way I do it is very simple. You pay them high

627
01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:54.520
Ivylevel: that they are not able to find you. You you are the I'm the highest payer that I I do number 2.

628
01:30:54.850 --> 01:30:56.240
Ivylevel: You invest in them.

629
01:30:56.510 --> 01:31:01.910
Ivylevel: You connect them to your network, you get them, help get help them internship and stuff like that it's a mutual partnership that you have.

630
01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:06.720
Ivylevel: and the second thing is, you have yearly contracts with them, so if I have a yearly contract with them.

631
01:31:07.330 --> 01:31:09.620
Ivylevel: they are committed, I'm able to secure them.

632
01:31:10.101 --> 01:31:13.320
Ivylevel: And that's why my log programs work for me. Right?

633
01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:14.080
Ivylevel: Yeah. So.

634
01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:17.529
Ajay: Yeah, I think we we talked about it last time. Yeah, I understand that. Yeah.

635
01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:18.930
Ivylevel: Yeah. So

636
01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.941
Ivylevel: I I think for me, the only thing is like, you know,

637
01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:32.140
Ivylevel: I actually used to spend lot of hours and all. My only the reason that a lot of parents have actually kept kept signing. And I've been like nearly 100% success rate is

638
01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:38.399
Ivylevel: because I'm passionate about this topic, and second, like I have myself like, it's a personal thing for me where I've struggled. I've wasted money.

639
01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:40.390
Ivylevel: My fight is only against.

640
01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:57.419
Ivylevel: you know the crimson and the big shops, and you know who are marketing heavily. And you, you are a data person at the end of the day like, think about it, just because an agency that has been a company that has been around for 10 years shows you a statistic of 450 success rate.

641
01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:02.520
Ivylevel: Now, how does it really translate to your child? Please help me understand? I don't understand. Right?

642
01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:10.609
Ivylevel: But data, you know, data is a. This is how data can be manipulated and and showed differently. So all I can tell is

643
01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:18.800
Ivylevel: what is more important to parents. As I say, look at our framework and thought problems. You saw the 2 sessions. You look at the quality of how this thing is being done.

644
01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:38.700
Ivylevel: You look at our report when we give you, you know you're gonna review it like how precise we are about targeting things, and that I can show you outcome after outcome social proof where I can tell you the 10 things we plan for our students, we have, we hit 3 or 4 that already. We have a very ambitious list. It's an okay. R, we'd say, Okay, I want to hit 10 national level awards.

645
01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:41.570
Ivylevel: We at least try to deliver 3 or 4.

646
01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:46.069
Ivylevel: Already you are in a strong position, because we know that they will get into the top 10

647
01:32:46.942 --> 01:32:50.980
Ivylevel: and and I think that's it. And and the best part I'll tell. You see, at the end of the day.

648
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:52.350
Ivylevel: the more

649
01:32:52.828 --> 01:33:01.460
Ivylevel: see, this is all again a college outcome, because again, results have to be important, because that is a differentiation. We all want results, you know, especially as Indian parents and

650
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.980
Ivylevel: competitive parents.

651
01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:07.379
Ivylevel: the reality hour as a parent. When I look at it, there is a huge transformation that happens

652
01:33:07.690 --> 01:33:24.769
Ivylevel: writing skills, you know, le like, look at Jenny as an example, like she goes to Washington, DC. Talking about AI ethics policy. She has. She goes to meetings with FBI right? And does. I mean, you know, this, like Stanford, does have access right? There is something that is up unique about these Iv schools. It gives you unfair advantage.

653
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:31.400
Ivylevel: So, working with those kind of people, and, you know, biomed as an example, right? She opens up doors, you know, connects

654
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:38.859
Ivylevel: so, and I just showed you like Rishi coming proactively coming to me. Hey? By the way, I connected with the Uci professor. Tell me if there's a student.

655
01:33:39.090 --> 01:33:46.590
Ivylevel: it's because they are. They are all like we are. They are a part right. Any small thing they do. They get rewarded like I'm I'm literally like, so that's the point. So

656
01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.119
Ivylevel: me up.

657
01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:59.330
Ivylevel: And you know everything is included. Right? See the for me, the easiest part is students. At the end of the day they should feel like, Okay, I have a real co-pilot, a human being like, I don't have to worry.

658
01:33:59.470 --> 01:34:05.139
Ivylevel: They are going to guide me on a month on a weekly basis. What to do? Just see how many ideas they brainstormed.

659
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:16.540
Ivylevel: She will identify 2, 3 put in. Really, you want your child also to enjoy the journey right? So you're taking away the stress you're letting someone else kind of really plan everything, and let them execute and enjoy it.

660
01:34:17.170 --> 01:34:30.649
Ivylevel: And they go, and they come back and say, You know I cannot start a club in my school. You know, this new school is very competitive, but I don't have friends. There's a lot of politics happening. You know. The real place where things are really big difference is really the soft skills and emotional skills and navigating these things.

661
01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:44.460
Ivylevel: they are able to give them very tactical help. Right? You know, the school politics is terrible. You will see that for sure, getting a letter of recommendation. So, getting a good letter, you know, my daughter got a letter from recommendation from Principal in 2 years

662
01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:51.749
Ivylevel: it takes one and a half years to plan it. Imagine if you, if he arf can get a letter of recommendation for principal

663
01:34:52.540 --> 01:35:00.599
Ivylevel: top. 3 items, and I'll I'll send you the whole deck from Rajashetti. You know the best college preparation data till date.

664
01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:03.039
Ivylevel: What drives the outcome. Eventually

665
01:35:03.744 --> 01:35:08.000
Ivylevel: the outcome is really driven to these 3 things extracurricular. Your recommendations

666
01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:13.920
Ivylevel: academic is not even a factor. Actually, that is not even the standout factor to get into top schools.

667
01:35:14.291 --> 01:35:28.439
Ivylevel: So these these are things, unfortunately. You know. They don't. I mean, private schools are good. But the problem with private schools again, like, you know, expectation is high, you know. Where is he coming from? Oh, he's coming from a place where there were 15 clubs in his school like, what does he done? Right? That's how they are going to think about it.

668
01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.520
Ivylevel: So, yeah.

669
01:35:30.610 --> 01:35:32.110
Ivylevel: anyways, I think.

670
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:33.130
Ivylevel: yeah.

671
01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:57.330
Ivylevel: think I I think the the point is again for me. The way I see it is, you know. I want to first clarify the service also because parents, I think it takes time. I initially assume that. Okay, because I live and eat and breathe this. I think parents also understand this because I've been in the problem space that takes time. Oh, then they ask me the same question after 3 weeks. Oh, I told you that I'm not gonna count you for number of essays and things like that.

672
01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.320
Ivylevel: Also I remind them

673
01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:13.249
Ivylevel: that you've been looking at commodity always right. And you're you're again starting. You're starting to compare me with like, you know, this is what is available in the market. I'm telling you that we have created something different, mainly because we know to stand out. You have to be different.

674
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:16.569
Ivylevel: We are going to find very unique even the awards we are going to select.

675
01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:22.490
Ivylevel: How do you? How do we get these kind of outcomes. You know that, you know. Remember that Jenny's a lot of gate kept things.

676
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:28.520
Ivylevel: People don't share certain awards and ceremonies and competitions that are, you know, very. They have been targeting.

677
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:32.210
Ivylevel: And and so it's very close. Number one. We identify those things it's not about.

678
01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:36.679
Ivylevel: It's not about the college prep knowledge. It's about hitting, you know, things

679
01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:40.419
Ivylevel: having close gated access to some professors having access.

680
01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:43.840
Ivylevel: Th, that's that's really what we are talking about.

681
01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:44.850
Ivylevel: So.

682
01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:48.689
Ajay: I I I think this this is great. I think the way

683
01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:51.707
Ajay: they were exposed to part of their

684
01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:57.669
Ajay: offering is was very helpful right? Because I think now auto has been involved.

685
01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:08.409
Ajay: and that's also key for for us to make a decision of where he feels comfortable. So I think this is great. Give us a week definitely

686
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.750
Ajay: do, and and I think you will send us the.

687
01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.129
Ivylevel: Nico, and.

688
01:37:13.130 --> 01:37:25.130
Ajay: This report, and some of the things you you discussed about some presentations and some profiles that'll be really helpful. I I think we wanna make a decision. I think we've been on this for almost a month or so.

689
01:37:25.765 --> 01:37:30.460
Ajay: We can't continue to keep doing it after a while. It sets off.

690
01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:40.490
Ajay: It's a it's the same information we'll be getting in different ways. So again I I I think I know where I'm waiting. But I think I need a week to make a decision.

691
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:41.190
Ivylevel: Hi! This man!

692
01:37:41.599 --> 01:37:46.100
Ajay: And then and then I will definitely reach out

693
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:51.860
Ajay: I mean, of course, it will be conversations in between, because there'll be some queries as well

694
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:53.630
Ajay: in between, right?

695
01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:57.037
Ajay: So in terms of the this particular

696
01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:59.289
Ajay: offering I I bought.

697
01:37:59.579 --> 01:38:05.770
Ajay: What's the next step on that I think I'll get a report and that's pretty much is what it would be right.

698
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:21.049
Ivylevel: Yeah, I think that's I mean, you know, it's like, you know, the thing is like, you know, we can share so much right, and one of the things also I tried to tell my coaches to kind of slow down, because some of the parents have come back to me, or there's too much to digest right. And we don't want to throw a lot of things.

699
01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:33.589
Ivylevel: I think we we have, I think, to be very honest. We've been very productive to meetings, because we also covered like a lot of Ap's and stuff like that. Typically, I try to avoid, you know, going very deep into that, because it's about building the profile and identifying.

700
01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:52.530
Ivylevel: So you you still have a week you know, from the report. And I'm not gonna count number of days, and all that. The whole idea is like we feel comfortable in giving you a compass. Right? We are, we are. We? We want to show you the quality of how we are thinking about it. And you know that roadmaps are evolving documents. They are living documents. So it's just the best guest.

701
01:38:52.530 --> 01:39:00.980
Ajay: I I I like. I like the touch of of the the high touch of of the offering. I mean, that's that's pretty key, and also the

702
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:03.139
Ajay: the the thought process of

703
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:13.219
Ajay: the entire package, or how to package into the outcome. I think I think that's that's very key. And also, I really like the way auto has been involved, and

704
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:23.530
Ajay: the the interest he has. I think I am confident that this offering would really help him see for again for me the end of the day.

705
01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:34.089
Ajay: Yes, there is a big thing of Iv, and there is a lot of advantages, but I want him to be a person who can enjoy this journey and also be successful as a overall package.

706
01:39:34.210 --> 01:39:44.570
Ajay: Worst case scenario is. Yeah, it doesn't end up with Ivy Lea. That's fine, but he has really become an individual which he can discover very early in his life. What he wants to become.

707
01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:52.310
Ivylevel: Absolutely. I think one last thing just as a social proof. I wanted to show you what an eighth grader is doing with us. Right?

708
01:39:52.678 --> 01:40:07.959
Ivylevel: Again. You know, I this is one of my challenges. Right? Of course you love it. But you can imagine that as as a founder I'm like, Okay, by high touch, is actually my biggest disadvantage to scale. But I'm fine because I'm generating a value where, just with word of mouth, I'm going on it

709
01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:09.820
Ivylevel: now. This is

710
01:40:10.303 --> 01:40:13.639
Ivylevel: Nilima. I think she's Vp. At Palo Alto Network

711
01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:25.299
Ivylevel: and the cyber security. I'm more than happy to connect you to just get her kind of thought because she had her elder daughter 2 years now she got into a competitive summer program and we are hopefully she'll get in. She's from Lynn Brook.

712
01:40:25.410 --> 01:40:33.629
Ivylevel: She took out her son eighth grader chess player, who, she put in something called Upward path. You know it's an eighth grader program

713
01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.900
Ivylevel: she took out. I'll show you that as well now.

714
01:40:38.650 --> 01:40:47.600
Ivylevel: So she. I have paired her son with a Cs. And business, Major Andrew, just like, you know. Jenny, right? One more person.

715
01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.440
Ivylevel: And

716
01:40:49.670 --> 01:41:04.629
Ivylevel: what she did was initially she came up with cyber security and Cs. And the son in 2 sessions the the son in 2 sessions basically said that I know I don't like cyber security I don't like Cs. He is a pro Fintech guy like finance Guy.

717
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:19.460
Ivylevel: He is all about investment and this. And he said, You know, but Mom still insists, and we are going to help her explore. Now he's working with a guy who's who's actually a Cs. At Stanford. But his minor is investment.

718
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.719
Ivylevel: And look at it. He's just flying back as a freshman.

719
01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:28.260
Ivylevel: He got accepted into 2 investment analysts role, talking about privilege and exposure.

720
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:34.201
Ivylevel: A freshman think about it as a Cs student. He's getting accepted in Wall Street into a big investment firm and.

721
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.300
Ajay: Which way, where? Which Stanford is also in Stanford.

722
01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:40.740
Ivylevel: Yeah. Standard. Yeah. My coach is one of one of my coaches. Right?

723
01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:41.510
Ajay: Oh, gotcha!

724
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:51.079
Ivylevel: I'm just telling you that, you know, just like you know, Jenny is just like the reason with Jenny is because Jenny has been with me. I treat her as a founding pm, because we co-created this, and she's my daughter's

725
01:41:51.483 --> 01:41:56.510
Ivylevel: and you know, like, mostly with bills. But guys like working with guys. To be honest, I've seen, you know, and we tried to match that

726
01:41:56.550 --> 01:42:11.689
Ivylevel: now, you know. So thanks, Sir Raj. I found the document. I'll show you the document they're working on. It was shared to another email congratulations to Andrew as we wants to apply for Uci course, as received by Andrew. So they spend 2 sessions

727
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:18.219
Ivylevel: to find a investment course in Uc. Irvine as a top course. He wanted her to enroll in the summer.

728
01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.129
Ivylevel: Now, what does Neil say?

729
01:42:20.583 --> 01:42:25.280
Ivylevel: You know, she said. Andrew, can you help him with the essay to the next session?

730
01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:43.530
Ivylevel: See, this is where the parents will understand he's an 8 grader, right? But parents know that. Why should I start early to get into a good program? Number one, who will help you to get into the right program and build your profile. Then you basically, you know, we are more than happy. Sometimes you do 30 min, 1 h. So basically, Andrew says that tomorrow is a session.

731
01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:59.710
Ivylevel: I will do essay writing and brainstorming on the long process. You know. It's a long process. You have to make a winning application to get into prestigious programs right? The. And and so I'm just telling you like that. He's an 8 grader admin. And then, he I don't know if I showed you because his sister is anushka

732
01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:00.440
Ivylevel: and

733
01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:03.966
Ivylevel: you know, this is where

734
01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:08.930
Ivylevel: She just kept winning like, you know winning after winning so many.

735
01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:12.280
Ivylevel: Because, yeah, see.

736
01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:17.749
Ivylevel: 2 months. We, you know again, preparation for years like whole sophomore. Now she won like back to back

737
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:40.099
Ivylevel: National Award. She got like, you know, 4 wins in a row like, you know. She got into Dharma program. She got another research project in National Smithsonian. She won the you know, the election at school like, so these things are all happening because because of that. So I think this is what I mean by outcomes right that we are not really talking about the final outcome.

738
01:43:40.330 --> 01:43:46.960
Ivylevel: Look at the profile and and the confidence that you're going to win. So anyways, I'm I'm more than happy, you know, because

739
01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:51.200
Ivylevel: you know. So I have to show, because this is a social proof that I can show right?

740
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:52.890
Ivylevel: So.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:54.479
Ajay: Yeah. Cool. Alright.

Ajay: Great thanks. Raj.

744
01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:22.170
Ivylevel: more than happy to go support you. I mean, I would say, let's get started. What's the harm? Because you can anyways use the the sessions, and we can at least use the summer let we can do something great in the summer, you know. Might be we should target a good good program is the way, yeah.

745
01:44:22.170 --> 01:44:26.570
