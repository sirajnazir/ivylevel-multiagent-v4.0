Yeah, I'll probably like, you know, first half an hour 5 00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.680 Ivylevel: I will kind of. Ask a few things I'll 6 00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.149 Ivylevel: then I will let you guys go into. 7 00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.620 Ivylevel: I mean, what? What is the top things that you had any tactical things you wanted to discuss with Jenny 8 00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.300 huda: first, I wanna talk about options. Yeah. 9 00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.370 Jenny Duan: hey? How's it going? 10 00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.269 huda: Hi, I'm well, how are you? 11 00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.829 Jenny Duan: I'm doing? Well, yeah. Well, I thought we could just get started. Could you 12 00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:41.509 Jenny Duan: start before we go into our normal updates? I'd love to just talk a little bit about how your sat went, and how you feeling about that? Because again, like this, the jump in scores is a little bit. Yeah, surprising. Because I think before you took the sat. You're also scoring about the same right on the practice test, and then, unless it went down. But now you're back to what your standard was like before everything. Could you tell me a bit about how you're feeling with that? 13 00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.609 huda: Yeah. So again, I'm kind of like confused because this time, like 14 00:02:47.610 --> 00:03:15.359 huda: I definitely like had no distractions or anything while I was taking the test. And, in fact, for some of the sections. I like, I tried taking a test area where, like, they're kind of a few noises, and like, cause, you know, in like testing sites, it's kind of there's a few noises in the background. So I kinda wanna test that climate and the results like, honestly, they were the same as before when I took the sat. But one thing I'm like unsure about is 15 00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.250 huda: how like the jump itself like is kind of confusing me as well 16 00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.280 huda: like. 17 00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:38.620 huda: and also like reading or like math is like, definitely like a lot easier for me on these practice tests. I don't know if it's because, like, these questions are like easier or like I just know how to solve them better or like, maybe I'm less stressed. But. 18 00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.899 huda: I don't know. I just feels like a lot easier than normal, like the actual sat. 19 00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.630 Jenny Duan: Do you feel like the questions themselves were easier? Or do you just feel like you were more prepared? 20 00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:12.739 huda: I think I was more prepared, actually cause there are like some difficult questions on there, but like I felt like I knew how to do them. And then also, especially after since we practice like deriving geometry like like equations. We didn't know them. I think that's like something that helped me during the practice tests. But yeah, I think I definitely felt a little more prepared. 21 00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:23.599 Jenny Duan: Got it? Okay, cool. Can we go just briefly over some of the questions that you said you wanted to talk about like you said there were a couple of math questions right? And was there anything else that you wanted to go over. 22 00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:36.530 huda: I think the other sections were pretty fun for me. So sorry to interrupt. Here II joined Jenni. Actually, I wanted to actually take an opportunity today. 23 00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:48.750 Ivylevel: And I don't know what what's a good time. Probably you guys can spend some time on sat, but I think I would at least need like a half an hour. I think what I wanted to do was more like a check point. In 24 00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.619 Ivylevel: really kind of, II think. Let's just repeat the whole kind of game plan and roadmap for Houda again. 25 00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.530 Jenny Duan: because I think 26 00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.070 Ivylevel: you know, primarily 2 things here right? And I'm again like talking like a dad now. Not like a dad. I am a dad. 27 00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.119 Ivylevel: That's the debate I have always with Huda. 28 00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:15.399 Ivylevel: She's so upset with that. But I think there are 2 things right. In fact, 3 things. So one is number one. 29 00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.269 Ivylevel: I still feel that Hooda and I, as well as a parent. 30 00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:46.559 Ivylevel: I think just knowing why we are doing certain things. It's still there's a still significant gap there, right? I think the why it, you know, knowledge. And and I think that's that's clear, you know, like lot of lot of students, a lot of parents are not aware of it. Parents don't have time, and it really depends on, you know, students who are really like into it. You know, like you're you're an exception, for example, right now you've gone to Reddit, and you've really learned a lot of things. 31 00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.069 Ivylevel: I think a lot of students are not aware of that. So 32 00:05:49.140 --> 00:06:03.269 Ivylevel: II would love to ask us to kind of just kind of re revisit. And and you know, focus on these 3 areas of aptitude and passion. And you know the themes that we are working on that that's critically required from an evaluation perspective, right? So just to understand that first 33 00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.040 Ivylevel: second is also, like, you know, focusing a bit more on the college. And the major list is important. 34 00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.860 Ivylevel: I feel like, you know it's it's a good time. Where? 35 00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:23.230 Ivylevel: II you know, while I know that Huda has been doing lot of things, and she can continue doing that. But I want Houda to like be very clear on. 36 00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:36.300 Ivylevel: You know, her target kind of schools and and programs, and there can be iteration and evolution, but at least at like 80%, she should be clear in her head. What she's aiming for. Why, she's working, you know, on a few things 37 00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:47.319 Ivylevel: that's 2, and then number 3 is, I know that there are a bunch of kind of tasks and goals and objectives that you have been working on in a very execution mode. 38 00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.109 Ivylevel: I would also want us to kind of reassess, revisit. Firstly, what pro progress has happened so far. 39 00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:08.480 Ivylevel: and really focus on a few things. No, might be, you know, if Huda is not able to handle a few few of those things, let's just eliminate them. You know, I want her to really like focus on the things where she can make an impact like, as an example, like, you know, Apa had a 40 00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:20.429 Ivylevel: you know, had a score kind of you know issue recently, like, I don't know if issues the right word. But I think Ap is kind of not working in a favor at this time. Right? So I would love to discuss that. 41 00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:32.299 Ivylevel: You know the the academic rigor. You know things things like that. So II want to do a holistic. Let's treat this kind of session as as a as a revisit. I would love to also, learn lot of things. 42 00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:40.309 Ivylevel: And I want HUD to also really start learning like why certain things are important, because unless she knows what the evaluation process is. 43 00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:52.959 Ivylevel: you know, it will be hard for her, like you know, she I don't want her to be like checklist follower, like. Oh, yeah, I've applied for this I applied for that I applied for I think she also needs to have a point of view 44 00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:14.850 Ivylevel: if she feels like oh, there are 3 programs that I've applied for. You know. I want her to have that kind of point of view. And then I would love to have. That doesn't make sense, because I would love to do that. I feel like Huda has that gap, and I also like I don't have time. So I'm I'm so I would love you to kind of educate us a bit more. Let's draft her whole roadpap again. 45 00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.780 Ivylevel: and let's take some decisions. I'm perfectly fine. 46 00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:35.490 Ivylevel: you know, based on her current academics and her trajectory. Let's let's have a very brutally honest, you know I would love you to have a very brutally honest kind of assessment, and tell you know what her chances. What's our best bet to get into like, you know, one of the top schools, you know that that aligns with her, and things like that. Sorry there are too many things. 47 00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:40.049 Ivylevel: This is really the Iv level kind of game plan session. Let's do that again for Huda. 48 00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.869 Ivylevel: So and we can do like half a half session today. And we can do another half session later. 49 00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.120 Ivylevel: Does that make sense? 50 00:08:47.610 --> 00:09:10.180 Jenny Duan: Yeah, totally but do you want us to spend more time talking about this? Or would you like to go over the SAT. We can start with this and just do this forward and pause the SAT. For another time, or we can start with the SAT. And then, after we finish that, go to this, what do you prefer? I think maybe we could talk about the SAT. In a separate small fast. So maybe like a 30 min session. 51 00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:26.220 Jenny Duan: Okay? Sure. No problem. So let's just get that scheduled for the future. But let's focus on your game plan right now. So and you know, sorry. Jenni, again, like you know, think that I don't know anything. Okay. Think you're meeting us first time I would love you to really start afresh. 52 00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:36.560 Ivylevel: And might be. You can give us an update like, you know. What? What do you think has been Hooda's journey. I know that you gave me a document as a as a product person as well like on on Houdas roadmap and evolution. 53 00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:47.859 Jenny Duan: And then I would love you to do an assessment, and, you know, start drafting a a game plan for Huda, and we can join. Do you work on it. Yeah, that makes sense. Sure. Yeah. Sounds good. So I guess 54 00:09:48.050 --> 00:10:11.010 Jenny Duan: what I would like to know is right now, at this point, you're still a junior your sat is come back. I think your sat is not at an optimal point for top schools, but I don't think that's like a major blocker. Because again, there's always the option to go test optional. But given that, your sat is a bit low. I think that is one like 55 00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:34.449 Jenny Duan: critical area. So I think I'm just gonna break it down from maybe like the most important to the least important things in the order of that the admissions officers look at. So the first major thing that they look at is your academics. So back to just checking in on your grades. How is that going for you this year? And how are your grade trajectory looking? Across high school? 56 00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:59.050 huda: Okay, so this is something that, I think is one of my weaknesses. Actually, so like I've had so far, I've actually had 3 B's and throughout. And I feel like there's a really high likeliness that I'm gonna get another. Be this semester for apus history, I'm like working on retaking some 57 00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:13.159 huda: like tests and stuff. But II really it's kind of like a low chance that I can get a. And I'm working really hard. I'm trying to persuade this teacher, and I've had her for like 2 years. And actually, last year I was able to like 58 00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:30.899 huda: kind of persuade her, I mean, like, obviously, I was close to an A, but I was like, Get an 89.9, and then she was able to round it. So I'm like trying, like my hardest to persuade her, but I'm not sure how high it's looking from here. So I'm not sure if I'll be able to get an a this semester 59 00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.080 huda: in a push. Yeah, but 60 00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:48.649 huda: usually like my trends and grades that I get like one B during the first semester and then and second semester full. A's that's how it's been like the past few years or the past 2 years. 61 00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.549 huda: that's kind of like the pattern of my grades. Yeah. 62 00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. What other classes have you received these in? 63 00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:09.250 huda: So honors biology for? First semester and then for sophomore year? Ap human geography 64 00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.849 huda: and chemistry. 65 00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.780 Jenny Duan: This is all for semester. 66 00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.360 huda: Oh, yeah. And then always for the second semester. 67 00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.129 Jenny Duan: Cool and then. just in general, what is your Gpa. 68 00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:31.349 huda: I think last time I checked like waited was like 4 point like 69 00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.630 huda: a 70 00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:43.619 huda: like I wanna say, last time I checked last year was 4.2 but unweighted. I think it's like 3 point 71 00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:51.359 huda: 3 9, maybe 3 or something like that in that range. 72 00:12:51.400 --> 00:13:00.910 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then the total number of aps that you've taken is api human geography, a push. And what's the total number of Aps and honors? 73 00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.190 huda: So far? It honors as well. 74 00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:14.069 huda: 8 Ap's and honors so far. How many are offered at your school? 75 00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.569 huda: Aps, I think 76 00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:32.360 huda: 18. But Ap's. I'm trying to take more next year. I think I'm gonna I'm planning for 4 right now for like ap environmental science, ap literature. 77 00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:38.639 huda: ap site. And there's one more I'm forgetting. Oh, I think 78 00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:45.110 huda: actually, I'm forgetting. But I was planning for 4 Ap's next year 79 00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:53.250 Jenny Duan: got it, and then out of the 8 ap honors classes you've taken. How many of those are Ap's and how many are honors? 80 00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.620 huda: 3 honors and 5 Aps. 81 00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.749 Jenny Duan: Got it. Okay. 82 00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:15.170 Jenny Duan: okay, so do you know, you don't have class rank? Right? Okay, cool and then SATP. SAT. 83 00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.230 Jenny Duan: You do have plans to take the act at all. 84 00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:25.460 huda: I was thinking after this sat no matter the score. I think I want to try the act at least once. 85 00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.210 Jenny Duan: Have you taken an act practice test yet? 86 00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.839 huda: I have. I think I got a 29 on that one. 87 00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.230 Jenny Duan: Okay? And what do? Why do you want to take the act? 88 00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.839 huda: I feel like the A CT, 89 00:14:39.850 --> 00:15:03.140 huda: although there's like a whole science section which is kind of intimidating me at first. I feel like the reading sections are a lot more straightforward as well as the math questions. And generally it's kind of considered easier. Not saying it is. But like, I think it's like more of my it could be a different testing test taking style. 90 00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:12.170 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, we'll leave that up to there. Okay? So then, so the first block of things that your 91 00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:23.450 Jenny Duan: evaluator will evaluate you on is academics, and this includes, you know, your your grades, test scores and your letters of recommendation. 92 00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:30.170 Jenny Duan: and the reason why that teachers want to look at this or schools want to look at. This is to see if you can 93 00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:43.379 Jenny Duan: like, if you would be a good academic fit for that institution. So they don't want you to fail. They want you to be successful at their institution, and that's what they use your academic performance to measure. 94 00:15:43.720 --> 00:16:08.780 Jenny Duan: I think right off. The bat. Having 3 B's is a big limiting factor. That's not to say that it's going to be the factor. I know that it's not something you can control at this point. So that's something that you know, we moving forward. It's really important to like, be on that upward trajectory. But I think I mean it's not. It's out of your control right now. But I think that having 3 B's will be a significant 95 00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:16.670 Ivylevel: let. Yeah, let's spend some time on this right. And I think you know, this is also like for 96 00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:24.959 Ivylevel: II think the this is like again, a very objective and and brutally honest kind of assessment. And the reason is very simple 97 00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.180 Ivylevel: that 98 00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:37.329 Ivylevel: I think we decide, and we focus on things that can really contribute, and that we can control moving forward and land in the best possible. And you know, maximize the best place where Huda can land. 99 00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:44.090 Ivylevel: And you know, because there's no point right like th. And this is where the fundamental issue is, where, when you don't understand. 100 00:16:44.250 --> 00:17:01.289 Ivylevel: like, it is morally challenging. You know it creates anxiety and stress on parents, on student. And they feel like, Okay, II absolutely have no chance now anymore, like, I'm done. So le so I want to also compare this with some of the discussions that we had, and this is also from my knowledge. So 101 00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.830 Ivylevel: no. 102 00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:10.940 Ivylevel: this is what does this entail everything that? You know, when we say aptitude. 103 00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:16.589 Ivylevel: is this like the the aptitude, or or is there anything else that's also a part of aptitude. 104 00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.579 There's also 105 00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:37.180 Jenny Duan: like prestigious awards. And but I don't think that that is something that right now who does necessarily eligible, for, because that's more like if you do signs fair, or if you win like math counts, or if you win something like that, but that's like, if you haven't been preparing for that since 106 00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:55.500 Jenny Duan: middle school. Then that's like, not necessarily something. So I think I think I think again, like you know, sorry for my ignorance. But I really want to understand this right? So really, the first theme and the main bucket is about your aptitude. And academic is actually the fundament the the core part of that aptitude 107 00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.830 Jenny Duan: and everything else like one is great test scores. 108 00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.659 Ivylevel: It's really to prove that. You know, your academic excellence correct. 109 00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:16.460 huda: Gp. 110 00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:24.789 Ivylevel: okay, so so I think, yeah. So I think, grades are critically important to and also to show that 111 00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:41.230 Ivylevel: your I'm again, like, I'm trying to understand the the meaning of aptitude here. Right? It's really around your subjects, your curriculum, your basic stem. It's very focused. It's it's it's it's absolutely not about extracurriculars. Correct. It's really your curriculum. 112 00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.730 Jenny Duan: that's what absolutely 113 00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.440 Jenny Duan: right. And and say, for example, you know, if there is 114 00:18:47.470 --> 00:19:05.459 Ivylevel: kind of Ssp, research. You know program that. Who that makes into that would also fall into aptitude correct because it proves her skill for for research. And okay, great. So the more credentials you add there, right? And I think, that's one. And as you said that. 115 00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:13.279 Ivylevel: how does any admission officer actually evaluate the the strength 116 00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:21.189 Ivylevel: or like, how would you actually give this score to this particular pillar, like, you know, academic rigor was one of them. So what are the main signals here? 117 00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:31.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So the the main thing that they would look at is the rigor of your school. So given that your school has 18 Ap's. That's 118 00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:54.239 Jenny Duan: quite a lot. So I mean, that gives good credentials that you're like coming from a rigorous institution. However, with that, then they would look at your Gpa. And seeing how you do compared to other students in your school and given that you have 3 B's that I mean, they don't rank. They don't rank, but they do have access to previous admin students from your school and other people who are applying. 119 00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:08.639 Jenny Duan: So if you have 3 B's and someone has maybe all A's, that's not to say that you're not an eligible candidate. They're just seeing that like you're not as strong in maybe these areas as another student. That doesn't mean that they won't admit you. That's just something that they'll take note of. 120 00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:27.230 Jenny Duan: And I'm not saying that 3 B's is like you won't get into any school. I think my roommate had 3 B's, and she's at Stanford, so it's not like, you know, awesome. I think that's precisely the kind of you know, profiles you wanna focus on right? Because. 121 00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:34.549 Ivylevel: to be very honest, like, just see, II wanna walk you through the experience here. And the pain point right? So Huda comes and tells me about this yesterday. 122 00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:40.049 Ivylevel: right? And me as a parent. Absolutely no idea about how the grading system works here. 123 00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:45.049 despite spending 8 months. And I'm ashamed to say that like because I never focus on grades. 124 00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:55.460 Ivylevel: I don't understand a bit of it, and to me it's already a bummer. I'm like what what like, you know. And then I go back to her. And I said, like, why did you? Why did you take this? Ap? Then? Right? 125 00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:03.970 Ivylevel: Oh, yeah. Because, you know, I had to show rigor. And you know, II discussed with Jenny and I came. I'm like now then, the question is 126 00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:10.710 Ivylevel: like, What if she did not take a piece? And she had, like, you know, her stead, she probably would have got like A's right. 127 00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:21.890 Ivylevel: So like my. My point is, there is one student now who hasn't taken Aps who doesn't show the rigor, but has a very good Gpa. Right? Because the and so how do you compare these 2 things? Now? 128 00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.280 Ivylevel: You have to have a good Gpa in difficult classes. 129 00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:35.110 Jenny Duan: It's yeah, it's really challenging. It's not like, you can have a. It's like you have to have both like. 130 00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:44.519 Jenny Duan: I think if it's it's not. If a student with bad like 3.5 Gpa. Is with assuming with the 4 point Ogpa, who doesn't take 131 00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.299 Jenny Duan: any a piece. It's not like one of them is going to get admitted. It's they're both gonna get rejected. 132 00:21:49.310 --> 00:22:06.219 Ivylevel: Does that make sense? So it's not like a comparison which one's better. It's they're both gonna get rejected. Okay, okay, so basically, what you're saying is like number one, not taking Ap is not an option for good schools. Number one. Is that a correct score? Unless your school doesn't have any Ap's. 133 00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.699 Jenny Duan: then it won't be put against you. But if your school offers a piece and you don't take them. That's 134 00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:20.160 Jenny Duan: red flag. But also Huda does. Huda school doesn't have lot of Ap's correct 18 is a lot. 18 is quite a bit, actually. 135 00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:35.599 Ivylevel: Oh, okay, I thought that, Huda. Actually, you know, there were not many like, because there there isn't that culture of Ap's in in Houdas school, and I thought that they were not offering, but looks like, you know. I'm sorry for my ignorance here, but I really want to understand this. So you're saying, Okay, good 136 00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.510 Ivylevel: So I think. 137 00:22:38.100 --> 00:23:01.099 Ivylevel: there's definitely a a, a kind of a risk right with with a student like, you know, who doesn't have that rigor. And they're trying to really do this for the first time. Or you know, there's always a risk. I mean, I'm not even saying about like Non. Look at Victoria as an example. Right? Like she's amazing. She's done all these research. She has got 2. B's right in Ap. Math, and she's applying for astrophysics, and she's published some amazing papers. Think about it 138 00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:10.089 Ivylevel: right but having to be as an astrophysics candidate in mathematics Ap. Or 2. She got a 2 just recently. 139 00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:35.489 Jenny Duan: The Ap. Scores don't matter that much. You don't have to report that unless you want to, and you can retake every year, so so does the Ap. Score like, does it help you in your application? Or is it just there for like credit. When you go to college, it helps you in your application. If, for example, you get a be in a class, but you get a 5 on the Ap test. That shows that you understand the content, which is what they care about. 140 00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:53.940 huda: Okay, yeah. I go to 5 on my Ap hug, exam, despite like having a be in the first semester. So yeah, I feel like, that's that's fine. Yeah. So now let's talk about what is the mitigation and fixing strategy. Right? I want to go really detail into this, because this is a problem that many students have. Jenny 141 00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:11.529 Ivylevel: having a bee 1 s, I'm gonna switch to this another screen. Because so I'm just gonna switch devices. Really, 1 s, no worries. This is very helpful. And Hoda, you also please feel free to jump in, because II really wow. 142 00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:26.559 Jenny Duan: that's not your room. You're still working late. This is the study study room in my the Wi-fi in my room as who to knows? It's not good. It's very laggy, so I'm now taking my meetings in a different room where the Wi-fi is much better. Yeah. 143 00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:55.039 Jenny Duan: See who the I mean. Like you're sign. I mean getting into Stanford is is just the beginning. It's it's it's it's a jail. Okay, you need to just keep learning. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. You'll enjoy but yeah. So I think Victoria's situation is a little bit different. But I think in this situation like, since you got a 5 on that test that shows them that you understand the material. So that's something that you should definitely put on your application. And it's not just, you know, for credit. So they under know that you understand the material. So that's good. 144 00:24:55.050 --> 00:25:08.660 Ivylevel: Okay. So let's do this now, like Jenni, I'm I'm telling, like, you know. Imagine that I come to you like we we are meeting for the first time like next year, when Huda is applying right, and we are going to do that. We are. We are launching this, and I'm kind of mixing both. 145 00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:18.349 Ivylevel: There are a lot of students who are gonna come and say, like, these are my weak spot number one. My grades aren't perfect, but I've done some great things in life. Right? III have an amazing narrative. 146 00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:29.289 Ivylevel: I've really shown a great trajectory rigor and all that stuff. But I have 3 Bs or 4 Bs. so let's work on a strategy like for Huddana. What concretely can Hudar do? What is the game plan here? 147 00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:38.419 Ivylevel: Because this is clearly a red flag. Right? You have said that this is a red flag, because when I compare, like another of students who are like all straight A's perfect scores. 148 00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:57.210 Ivylevel: but there is also this counter argument that being like too perfect, is not the goal right? We that that you have to show, standing out like just having a perfect grade is your very more requirement. But that is not the guy. And and and I would love to actually talk to your roommate like, you know, would love to ha understand like you know, what? 149 00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:18.159 Ivylevel: What did she do to change that game? And that is to me very inspiring story, right like, how do you change the game from 3 B's so so fix this for me. Now, right like I've come to you as a dad very vulnerable like. You know me, my daughter. I'm like, okay. She's got other things. Might be she's got an award, might be. She made it to like launch. I don't know like we'll be, because there is still hope to do that. 150 00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.599 Ivylevel: but sorry. No control. She's got 3 B's. What will you do? 151 00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:42.830 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Well, I would say, first of all, emphasizing in your narrative, like what other, what other things make you more special or more distinct from other students like, what about your background? Makes you a really good fit for this school? And what and what about you makes make it so that you can be academic. 152 00:26:42.830 --> 00:27:07.079 Jenny Duan: academically successful at this institution. And what else do you bring that maybe isn't reflected in your transcript, because, as you know, like the grades aren't the most important. I mean, they are very important, but they're not the only important thing about a student like they have a story. They have other aspects of their character that they can bring, and like emphasizing those other things, I think also, if you have poor grades, but a very strong test score that can help balance it out. 153 00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:32.059 Ivylevel: yeah. So that would be one thing I would say like, if you are senior, I would say you should take a test, and you need to get this scroll. And how is it different for Houda now? Okay, senior, I get it like, you know, it's already too late. She can't change anything now. Who does got these 3 Ap's sorry, I mean, I sorry for my ignorance again. I don't know like, you know I still don't get the difference between Ap. And the Transcript score. Probably it looks like, you know, Ap is optional. I can share it or not. 154 00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:48.559 Ivylevel: But transcript is something that's on the record. You can't just like. It's immutable record. It's already there. You can't just like, you know, erase it, or you can't change it anymore. Right? So what can Hudar do? Specifically? Now that you know these subjects? Tell me something very like, you know, a concrete plan as to. How can Houda 155 00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.359 Ivylevel: fix or enhance or mitigate these things apart from like just on the grading? 156 00:27:53.420 --> 00:28:02.689 Ivylevel: Forget about you know the test scores right. Any anything that she can do, or it's completely gone now out of out of her control. Well, the semester is not over. Do you have finals? 157 00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.649 huda: Yeah. If you get a hundred on your final, we can a in the class. 158 00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:22.809 huda: So we have like unit tests. Actually, instead of the final. So it's kind of weighted the same. But if I were to add, like a few retakes, that I could get cause here, if you get like just anything below a 90 you can score up to a 90. So I got like an 80 on my test 159 00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:34.869 huda: and then maybe I can like retake that to get a higher score, and then, if I if I do all my assignments and I get to a 90, then that's the only possibility of me getting an a 160 00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.189 Jenny Duan: so that sounds like a plan, then. 161 00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.909 huda: Yeah, but I don't know how like 162 00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.869 huda: possible. You told me yesterday there was no plan, and now you're giving me a plan. I don't understand. 163 00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:52.799 Ivylevel: Yeah. So I think I think there is there. So I think again the freshman and sophomore is gone right. It's a done deal. 164 00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.260 Ivylevel: You can change that. 165 00:28:54.300 --> 00:29:12.610 Ivylevel: And I think one one pattern that Huda has highlighted is she always gets these things at the beginning of the semester, and she ends up in an A at the end. So there is that upward trajectory, and I would still love to know, like, you know why that happens. And she did the same thing this time as well, and I don't know why that that's the recurring pattern here. Right? 166 00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:40.859 Jenny Duan: But sometimes for me, like I can only push myself if I'm kind of in like this underdog mentality where I'm like, okay, I did bad. But so now I have to do better. But I don't know if you feel that way, because I think the first semester you don't have that pressure where you're like. I need to do better. But I think in the second semester, if you don't do well in the first semester, then you have like I need to do better, and then you do. I don't know. Experience that sometimes it happens for me between like a midterm and a final 167 00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.630 huda: yeah, for sure. 168 00:29:42.650 --> 00:30:12.539 huda: I think one thing is like in the first semester, at least, like the courses are really different. For example, like I took ap human geography the year previous, and then we only had to do like simple Frqs. But this year we have, like essays which are like really different to me at least. And then it's like definitely like a lot more different from before. And I think in the second semester you kinda get used to like the way of taking those tests like the way of like learning 169 00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.299 huda: in those classes, and like you kind of get better at that. But 170 00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:28.809 huda: I don't know. I think that's just like how I learned. But I needed. I knew, like, fix that in this semester. So yeah, okay, so, Huda, you said that you have like 3 already. And this was the fourth. B, correct. 171 00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:36.830 Ivylevel: Yeah, okay, so what I'm hearing is that you still have an opportunity to correct the fourth B into an A, 172 00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:48.950 huda: I'd have to. 173 00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.549 Ivylevel: And why is that hard? 174 00:30:53.750 --> 00:31:02.469 huda: Well, I don't know. Just like the tests in general, the retics in general really difficult. Okay? And and this is like history. Yeah, ap, history. 175 00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:14.449 Ivylevel: okay? And and okay, so that's number one. Okay, so at least you have a plan there. The next thing is, what are the things not to do right? Because she's already got this thing like, I think the things that she cannot afford 176 00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:21.650 Ivylevel: to do moving forward is to get another B, and how do you avoid that? And I think that's something that we need to discuss as well. 177 00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:47.219 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think the key to that is like looking at your study habits and how you study. This is, I think, very individual and depending on the person like in your habits, like, if you tend to procrastinate, then fixing that if you tend to not do assignments on time facing that, if you maybe just have struggles with a material or content, then you know you schedule office hours with your teacher, you get peer advising 178 00:31:47.220 --> 00:32:02.689 Jenny Duan: from your friends. You get tutor. If you really don't understand, you look at Khan Academy. There's lots of things you can do once you identify the root cause of the issue. If you're not memorizing things well, maybe you need to sleep more. You know it is very dependent on the person and what 179 00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:18.139 Jenny Duan: the issues are causing are caused in their life. I think, for me, for example, some issues that I experience with my grades is I'm a procrastinator, which means I don't study until the day before the test. And then that's not really an effective way to study. And I recognize that, but 180 00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:29.149 Jenny Duan: that like impacts my grades. And so, but for other people, it's, you know, very different. Like some people. They don't understand the content. They they don't understand the lectures, and then they will get a tutor to fix that. 181 00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:46.659 Jenny Duan: and like in high school in my classes for me math is very challenging. I got tutors like I worked with other students. I found ways to learn the content because I didn't understand it from lecture. So it really depends on, I think, what you think your issue is, and then going in to fix that sort of on an individual level. 182 00:32:47.190 --> 00:33:04.079 Jenny Duan: But I think that, like definitely high school grades are something that should be achievable with time and hard work. I think that you're not gonna encounter any material in high school that you really don't know how to do. I think, April, especially if you can memorize the content. 183 00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:10.229 Jenny Duan: you just memorize it and imply on the test that maybe that means you need to study 2 weeks in advance before every test. 184 00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:23.299 Jenny Duan: But that's something that you can do. It's very. It's very much something that is in your capacity. So I feel like you shouldn't feel like it's something that's out of your reach, because this is content and material that you're very capable of doing. 185 00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:33.569 Ivylevel: Yeah. And I'm I'm really want, like, you know again, like see? Again, Mike noticed, because I absolutely have no idea how is this calculated? And you know, like it's it's a cumulative kind of score. You see like, how. 186 00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:49.340 Ivylevel: Imagine a person like me like you know, who spent so much time on this? I have no clue about it like this is this is the limited knowledge of parents, right? Because we don't understand, especially migrant parents. Here. I think tutoring as an example. I don't know why. Why haven't we taken any tutoring yet? Right to the 187 00:33:49.500 --> 00:34:06.379 Ivylevel: I think these are the kind of things that I would love to see, like, you know, might be putting a game plan here number one fixing the Ap. History, but also anticipating which other Ap's. Are you thinking that you might end up getting a B, then right 188 00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:16.510 Ivylevel: preparing for that. So yeah. So tutoring is clearly an extra. I'm looking at like, what extra support can Hooda get right? So tutoring is is important, like, you know, 1 one good mean 189 00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:20.590 Ivylevel: any other tools and techniques and tips. Jenny. 190 00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:41.040 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think like just making a good study plan and be on top of study habits is something that is very challenging to develop. I recognize that. But I think, like for test taking and stuff that's very much in your control? With a push test. Are they like memorization? Are you writing? Dbqs? What are you doing in your test. That is difficult for you. 191 00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:57.339 huda: I think just generally like the topics are really like widespread. And it covers like, really like wide topics, so like Mc. Queues and sausage are both kind of difficult for me, but mainly saues I struggle with the most 192 00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:24.959 huda: because it's kinda hard to think about like a specific example on the spot, especially when there's like one thing you've been setting for. And then like. And then you just get the question based on something really different. It's like, kind of like, especially, we go to her we call it success session. But basically office hours and then she kinda like hints at what's gonna be on the test. And sometimes she hints on the wrong things, throw us off. And so like 193 00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:51.089 Jenny Duan: that was kind of like off putting one we had that. But yeah, well, I think you can just do more sa que? That's like the best way to practice is, look at previous tests. The good thing about a push is like all the past tests have been released. So if you literally go from like the beginning of when a push was started to. Now, or go from now to the beginning, you can look at all the previous and just do more practice. 194 00:35:51.100 --> 00:36:16.200 Jenny Duan: And then eventually you'll just be more familiar with every concept. But, for example, with understanding concepts and connecting them, maybe you can find a way that works for you to like connect different topics across different a push errors, for example, making mind maps, making tables, visualizing it in different forms like, I think if you look online, I like April study tips and advice like, you'll probably find a lot of people breaking it down of. You know how you can best prepare for a push. 195 00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:32.700 Jenny Duan: How you can better study how you can better organize the content review, etc. And so I think that again, I feel like getting your very much in your capacity, and also what's challenging about the assignments? That you feel like it's difficult to get 90 on 196 00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:44.089 huda: they're all like retakes, really, and like honestly, I think the thing is well, first of all, like I told my teacher how I needed to do like multiple retakes 197 00:36:44.090 --> 00:37:09.619 huda: and she kind of like she's like, you don't have to do that. You're it's fine if you have a B, but I told her I need an A and she's like she kind of tried to restrict me from taking multiple retakes. But you know, I just said like II don't think it's fair that you're limiting me from doing that. And so like, now, I'm gonna retake like 4 different tests. But I think what's diff difficult about that is just like 198 00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:31.820 huda: there units from like far back and then till now. And I think it's just the like. I said that the contents really like widespread. I think if I spend more time on it, like maybe do some research and watch videos and stuff and redo my notes. Basically. I might be able to like, revisit those things and maybe get a higher score. 199 00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:43.799 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. One channel that I really like on Youtube is Heimar's history. I'm gonna put that in the chat. But he makes really good. He's like another teacher that makes really good a push reviews. 200 00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:51.410 Jenny Duan: So I recommend watching his videos. But I think that you know, if if all you need to do is. 201 00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:55.220 Jenny Duan: you know, do redo 4 tests to get a I feel like that's very much 202 00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:10.500 Jenny Duan: in your capacity and to do to take the Ap test. Anyways, you're going to have to review it from the beginning. So maybe you can just think about this like you reviewing for the Ap test, because you'll need to know everything for the beginning, for the real test, anyways. 203 00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:18.099 Ivylevel: Okay? Oh, okay. So first thing is like for her to just retake. And that is not even ap right, that is, 204 00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:43.570 Ivylevel: that is just like her kind of regular class retakes to fix this right on the transcript. And then there is also an Ap. Exam towards the end, where she, if she gets a good score and and it's gonna be the same prep right? Whatever she prepares here is what's gonna help her. And if she gets a 5 there, that's actually a great story. Then right on showed the improvement amazing. And what do you mean by study plan? 205 00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.780 Ivylevel: Jenny, like. What? How would you define a good study plan? 206 00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.660 Jenny Duan: Well. 207 00:38:49.760 --> 00:39:13.579 Jenny Duan: I think what a bad study plan is, is just looking at your notes before the test. I feel like that doesn't help you at all. A study plan is just whatever method you use to review for an exam. Usually, that's like over a couple of days, like saying, Okay, I need to review these units here. And here I'm going to do X amount of practice problems. I'm gonna take X practice test. I'm going to use active recall, 208 00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:26.010 Jenny Duan: use other memory devices to help ensure that I know all this information. That's like a study plan. It's when you break down exactly how you're going to study and prepare for an exam instead of kind of doing whatever, and then going in blind. 209 00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:34.480 huda: And this what the tutor helps you with Jenny, like you said, you yourself have taken some tutors right like I haven't seen who that taking tutors. 210 00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.520 Ivylevel: I think she recently did one or 2 like math tutor for something. But. 211 00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:57.929 Ivylevel: like W. What does it to you to really help you with like. So I'm wondering. I mean, as part of this mentoring program. It's something like, you know, the value that like th, the information that you're actually giving now like, that's an integral part, right? Because it's an integral part of the college prep, too. Right? And and, for example, like, just like, forget about all the academics. 212 00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:13.770 Ivylevel: But for Hudar to really be on top of her ap you know the B grade. It's something that's pretty much within the limit of of a mentor here, right like you can really help her just like you're helping or or on sat as well. So I just wanna understand, like, you know, what does the tutor really do like, you know? Do they really help you with 213 00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:19.020 Ivylevel: kind of giving this kind of a study plan instead of a game plan for college prep. 214 00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:37.670 Jenny Duan: In my opinion. No. The reason why I had a tutor specifically for math is because I didn't understand what my teacher was saying in class. and so I needed to have someone else who, in my opinion was a better explainer. Just review the lecture with me, review the contents and just basically reteach me the material. 215 00:40:37.720 --> 00:41:02.699 Jenny Duan: But I think different people have different uses for tutors. That's the same thing with sat tutors. Some people on sat, and they're going to be teaching you content. Some other sat. Tutors are going to just be holding you accountable for your practice. So it really depends on what the students individual need is like. Some people can have a tutor to help them make study plans if that's what they need to do. But for me, I didn't really have any issues with studying was more understanding 216 00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:09.570 Jenny Duan: content. So it depends on what specific issue the student is experiencing. Then they can find someone to help them resolve that issue. 217 00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:28.560 Ivylevel: Yeah. And II definitely think that. You know, the teacher. The quality of teacher and the school also, like, you know, plays into this right. Those are some of the variable factors correct? You know how you know. So you know, whatever we can control, we should. And I would love to see who that really like, you know, change the game here. 218 00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:34.559 Ivylevel: I mean, that will be like II honestly like, you know, don't even care like you know where she eventually like, you know, lands, I think for me 219 00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:47.920 Ivylevel: these small wins are more important, and these are like, you know, this is what will be will be very helpful. So so that's one I think. And 220 00:41:48.330 --> 00:42:01.520 Ivylevel: so, first fixing this Ap. And then whatever remaining Ap's are there, she needs to be on top of that. She needs to be top upgrades. I think she should probably have a goal that she's not getting any more like, you know. Be, I think that should be your kind of not star now, right 221 00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:04.879 Ivylevel: so being more like, you know, on top of it 222 00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:12.840 Ivylevel: great, then sat, as you rightly said, I think that becomes even more critical now, right? Because 223 00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:18.389 Ivylevel: that's the thing. Okay, cool aptitude. Now. 224 00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:26.020 Ivylevel: what are the other things that you had actually planned for the to boost her aptitude score. Right? So this is like grade. 225 00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:33.200 Ivylevel: You know, she you know she has to just be. II don't think we can do drastically anything different. She has to, just like, you know, do good 226 00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:39.699 Ivylevel: but sat. She has a great opportunity to really come up with like even a perfect score. Why not? 227 00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:44.060 Ivylevel: And I think, what else? In the aptitude bucket? 228 00:42:44.740 --> 00:43:11.459 Jenny Duan: That's mainly it in terms of aptitude. Letters of recommendation. That's also something down the line. I think it's really important to establish good relationship with your teachers and also sure that you're academically curious by asking questions in class, by, you know, working well in teams, by communicating well with your teacher. That's also really important. But other than that, there's not that much else for aptitude. Basically, just your test scores and your grades. 229 00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:18.009 Ivylevel: Okay? And what about those th, the awards and the scholarships that you are applying to that doesn't fall under aptitude. 230 00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.729 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think those are more like 231 00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:35.899 Jenny Duan: impact passion for the most part, but I think, depending on what it is that could also qualify your aptitude. But again, those like major sides bear things. If you are not involved in that, since, like middle school or early high school. It's 232 00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.639 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's worth spending time to do that. 233 00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.010 Ivylevel: Yeah. 234 00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:50.480 Ivylevel: and and and that's something that again, it's very subject and curriculum driven right, like math or science, or something like that, right Olympiad as an example. 235 00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.660 Ivylevel: Where would the Decca Club? And things like that fall? 236 00:43:54.220 --> 00:44:15.129 Ivylevel: Extracurriculars. Well, those are extracurriculars. Yeah, I think it's a great area, right? Because you can. You can. You can literally like, okay, say, Hey, I did a stem research. I published a paper. Now, is that an aptitude, or is that an extra? It's mostly extra curricular, like all that is majority, is extracurricular. They feed into each other. 237 00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:31.310 Ivylevel: They're connected like the web, as you really say, okay, cool. Okay. So that's pretty much it. Okay, now, let's focus on the second. Sorry I'm driving the conversation a bit more here, because I want to also learn and and reiterate a few things. Now let's talk about the extracurricular or the passion, as we call it? 238 00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:43.599 Ivylevel: And then the community and the service right? So passion like, let's let's focus on what are the things that hoda you know is working on. And and just if you could give me an update and you know that you could give me an update like, you know. 239 00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:50.120 Ivylevel: Where are we with that? And and you know, how will, how will that really contribute and impact 240 00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.749 Ivylevel: in terms? I mean, again, you can play the dual role of an admission officer. 241 00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:03.400 Ivylevel: you know. So just just simulate that thing for me. If Buda can do XYZ, that really boost her chances to do it, you know, get into like these kind of schools. 242 00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:08.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think that right now, what who does doing is already quite a lot. I think it's. 243 00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:33.479 Jenny Duan: I think, right now what I'm seeing as her main, like 3 types of activities are. First of all like being a developer freelance, developing, working on her video game, doing, empowering AI, doing her Youtube channel. I think that that lens of like being a being a developer, especially a female developer, is really impactful and important. I think that that's awesome. I also think that her passion for filmmaking. 244 00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:42.529 Jenny Duan: especially with folklift and her Youtube channel, and like film club at school, that's also really impactful. 245 00:45:42.530 --> 00:46:04.729 Jenny Duan: and so right now, I think that those are like the 2 main, like types of activities that I see Huda really involved in. I think that within those 2 types of activities there's still a really good mix of leadership, of extracurricular service. And so I think that that's all good. Who does anything we want to add in regards to like extracurriculars. 246 00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:28.270 huda: I guess. Maybe like my filmmakers club to like highlight my passion for filmmaking. And like media arts. I think one thing that kind of took initiative in is we're making the short film right now, and we've already published one before. But we're I'm gonna try to publicize it a bit more. But 247 00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:55.020 huda: besides that, like, I think we're making a pretty full fledged short film this this year, and I did all the script writing for this one because there was there wasn't that much club involvement. But like besides that, I think that this one's gonna be pretty grand. And we're planning on doing like like a movie night where we premiere it basically. And we're trying to have it school wide. To have like a greater impact. And like more people attending. 248 00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:18.969 Jenny Duan: Yeah? And then I think right now, what I'm seeing is the most necessary is, I think you have a good foundation. I don't think it's really necessary to like start a lot of new organizations now, but I think what is most impactful would be to like, expand your impact within these organizations or within these projects that you're doing. Another thing that I think is 249 00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:29.090 Jenny Duan: could be impactful is just expanding your I guess, like cultural identity and being more like connected to that, because I think that that really drives a lot of 250 00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:55.879 Jenny Duan: that drives like a lot of motivation, even with affirmative action. I think that it's really important to emphasize your culture. Specifically, I know, for my roommate. This is something that she emphasized a lot. She did a lot of Asian American advocacy in Chicago that was like her main spike, and she connected that to like her passion for public health, and why she wants to become a doctor because she's pre-med. But I think for you, obviously that connection is going to look a little bit different. But I think it's 251 00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:01.559 Jenny Duan: still really important, like, especially within technology and within video game development, to have like 252 00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:11.890 Jenny Duan: diversity in characters and video games in developing in software engineering. And like, you can really use your background as something to help you. So I think that that's like. 253 00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:23.690 Jenny Duan: so an opportunity for you to add a little bit more depth to your application. Because that's the thing with, you know, a lot of applicants is that on paper, a lot of people might look really similar, like, there's a lot of people who 254 00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:46.089 Jenny Duan: are involved in coding. Okay, there's a lot of people who maybe like video games that doesn't really make you different. But what makes you different is the intersection of all these things, and how your identity and your background really motivate you to pursue these things like no one else? Is you? So what are? What are the things about you that make you you like. Those are the things that you should bring out in your application, so they can distinguish you from other people. 255 00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.950 Jenny Duan: So I think that right now, like. 256 00:48:48.990 --> 00:49:13.249 Jenny Duan: I am really happy with your progress so far, I think that what's just most important is expanding the impact. So getting the word out to other people, because to be honest like for years is not really a lot of time to do stuff. And unfortunately, I think it is almost more important to like, tell other people that you're doing things rather than actually doing the things that make sense like. It's more important to have your impact 257 00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:43.030 Jenny Duan: really shown to other people and demonstrated then to like, even make the impact itself like, if that makes sense, I think you need to have some more like proof of work. Like, how many people have you impacted? How? What have you done like Xyc, and like, how are you working on developing that more? Because, remember, colleges are not investing in your work, they're investing in your potential. So they don't actually really care how much you've done? Or do they want to see like at their institution. What will you do 258 00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.299 Jenny Duan: in the future? 259 00:49:44.300 --> 00:50:06.800 Jenny Duan: And so how does your interest in your background, and what you're doing right now? Inform your decision making for the future. So they don't actually care if you're like a coder, or if you're an artist, or if you're a musician or anything else. All they want to see is that you have a passion. And you're gonna like, eventually do something bigger with this passion. So they wanna see like, why you're interested in and how you hope to expand that over time. 260 00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:12.829 huda: Amazing, amazing! II think this is so enlightening. And II think 261 00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:20.429 Ivylevel: you know. And and this has been. This is really fundamentally the the kind of mystification of 262 00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:29.530 Ivylevel: this whole college pro process, right? Because it is such a such a ambiguous area. Right? Like you can. Literally, you can frame it the way you like it. 263 00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:38.859 Ivylevel: And it's not a standardized space. And I think that's what we are also trying to do. Because if you, I think students don't even know like what they are aiming for right like. And 264 00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:51.779 Ivylevel: you mentioned spike. And I've heard this multiple times, right? Like, because I think different mentors have absolutely different kind of play books. Right? So, Janice, her playbook is very simple right. She comes in to any call, and she would just say. 265 00:50:51.820 --> 00:51:00.189 Ivylevel: there are 2 paths, and you know this is like 3 years 4 years old, like kind of thing, you know. She's already like, you know, on on her way out, like now to to the the workforce. 266 00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:06.949 Ivylevel: So she would like, you know, either spike or broad, right? And you know, maybe is like even like 2. So, for example. 267 00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:19.669 Ivylevel: what I so I think this is how I would love to frame this right so that Huda understands. So what do you and I'm I'm just kind of internalizing it and trying to capture it in in some framework. 268 00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.270 Ivylevel: That's kind of our dashboard as well that I'm building. 269 00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:32.499 Ivylevel: So what you just mentioned like Number one, this academics or aptitude, whatever you call it like in academics. Partly. Next thing is really these extra curriculums right, which is really passion at the end of the day. 270 00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.770 Ivylevel: I think 271 00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:54.830 Ivylevel: 2 things right one is really a mean, and the other thing is the outcome and the goal that you're it's really to demonstrate your passion. What? What is the goal. What is the objective of what you're doing? I think all these extracurriculars and this passion projects, and all these are just means to demonstrate that you are really passionate about something 272 00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:57.410 Ivylevel: and with depth, and that spike. 273 00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:13.740 Ivylevel: and that when you come to this particular school you will be able to really make a big impact, right as an alumni, or you know, as as as a college student, you know of this particular school. So I think that's what you're demonstrating, and the way the admission officers again internalizing 274 00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:18.920 Ivylevel: the way the admission officers evaluate that in whatever one or 2 min they get 275 00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.080 Ivylevel: is through the lens of the impact you have done. Is that correct? 276 00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:45.600 Ivylevel: It's it's not to really know who the other see? At the end of the day of the like all the great work, and she's been showing me amazing work, like she's such a great developer. I even told her that, you know. Maybe you don't even have to go to school right? Like, just go in and maybe should just get a job right? She can be a great game developer like she's amazing in development. Like II can vouch for that. But she's like, No, I wanna go to school. So 277 00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.169 Ivylevel: what they're gonna look at it is not your game, what you've done? 278 00:52:49.260 --> 00:53:01.069 Ivylevel: They're like, okay. What impact did you make like, for example, Maddie? As an example. she had a Minecraft server. She generated $60,000 revenue in her middle school. 279 00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.639 Ivylevel: right? And her story was her mom actually 280 00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:14.620 Ivylevel: a tiger? Mom did not like her playing game, and she basically just threw off her laptop or or computer. And this is a publicly available interview. And I'll show a very inspiring story. 281 00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:37.679 Ivylevel: And and she basically said, You know what like, I'm gonna make my own money right? A bit rebellious. But she constructively used it. And that's what got her into mit launch X video. I saw that video as well, and she got another program as well. She got accepted into 2 just because of that kind of narrative and that story that she built. So it's one kind of that impact that Huda has to show something that that will be a good spike for her 282 00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:46.290 Ivylevel: number one, and then also, like what are the 3? If I were to put like 3 attributes right? One is your 283 00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:52.270 Ivylevel: passion in your subject, your stem correct? Because you're saying that she's a developer. That's number one. 284 00:53:52.500 --> 00:54:03.629 Ivylevel: Then you're telling that it's not enough to be a developer, because there are too many developers out there like. There is nothing special about it. That's why don't just blindly run towards AI time a dozen. 285 00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.229 Ivylevel: But you're also 286 00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:10.580 Jenny Duan: a videographer. That's your creative side. Your humanity's side of it. 287 00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:20.040 Ivylevel: Then you are trying it together, right and plus your, then you need to bring in the impact. So stem humanity's impact 288 00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:24.749 Ivylevel: the community service impact right? And and the impact is really the community impact correct 289 00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:52.050 Jenny Duan: yeah impact can be through various forms. So for example, if you're a science researcher. You publish your paper. That's a big impact, too. Impact is dependent on what you want to do. But for who to like? If she's able to reach a lot of people with her video game. That's a big impact. If she's able to, you know, inspire a lot of people to support these small businesses. That's big impact, too. It's dependent on. You know what a person does. Okay, it doesn't necessarily have to be a community impact. Is that correct? 290 00:54:52.050 --> 00:55:01.889 Jenny Duan: It's best if it translates into community, like, for example, with the science thing like, how does what you've learned impact the community? But I mean. 291 00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:20.930 huda: so I I'm in the process of like trying to get other people in like involved with folklift. So I'm like trying to expand it to like other communities beyond the Bay Area, and, like, you know, getting them to write their own articles about their own minority groups. 292 00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:41.429 huda: so that cause like impact, like having like have having impacted like multiple regions with like more people involved or is like, is the act of having like, for example, like if I were to put I produce like 50 articles. As comparison to like. I've contacted like 293 00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:53.279 huda: 5 people throughout the nation. And they've written it around written about their own minorities like which one do you think like would be a better way to Port Portray like folklift? 294 00:55:53.310 --> 00:56:08.510 Jenny Duan: You could say you've built this platform now with over 250 articles. That's what you would say. like you built. This doesn't matter if other people contributed to it. There's now 250 articles on it. If 5 people each right 50, I mean, that's how you present it. Yeah. 295 00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:19.290 Ivylevel: So, Huda, you are in a scale-up mode here, and I think one very important point that Jenny mentioned that this particular, like the at this point in time, Huda. and also great learning for me. 296 00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:39.650 Ivylevel: It's all about scaling and impacting your focus. Your energy should be on that. I think whatever you've developed are your assets. Now you need to see how you can really showcase them and how you can bring that out. And I think that's not a not. That's not an easy thing, Jenny, and I'm I'm kind of talking this like as as on the Pm. Front. I think a great value that we can add here, because. 297 00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:52.669 Ivylevel: you know, that's where kids struggle like, you know, Huda has got these assets. She like, for example, like she has been there, you know, really like struggling to get these middle schoolers for a free kind of AI thing. 298 00:56:52.730 --> 00:57:08.210 Ivylevel: because she's not very exposed to like social media scaling of channel. She's doing it for the first time, and I think this is where we can really help and guide her. I mean to a point that I've actually spoken of the record, and maybe we can delete this. I've spoken to many Stanford students, you know, right? 299 00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:17.979 Ivylevel: And I've heard some weird, weird stories right like on how these things work. And you know, especially with international students coming from abroad like, you know, that. You know, things are like. 300 00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:33.459 Ivylevel: you know, I don't wanna call it out. But yeah, so it's like having a pr agency, you know, having like a videographers like, you know, they literally they they, you know, they spend money to to make this thing like, you know, have your Pr out there. Things like that. This happens 301 00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:38.899 Ivylevel: right? It's a gamified system at the end of the day. So I think that's something 302 00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:43.679 Ivylevel: is is a good value. Add right? That we can really position. 303 00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:51.800 Ivylevel: It's not so much about what extracurricular to do. I think it's also about scaling and showing that impact where the the beauty is. Right? 304 00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:54.720 Definitely. 305 00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:55.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 306 00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:06.399 Ivylevel: okay, great. I know that there's one last minute. But this was important. I think, then, eventually, I think the third bucket is is really having that that narrative that you want to tell. And I think. 307 00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:16.979 Ivylevel: And this is where you brought this. II didn't really know where to fit the identity, because identity to me, like, you know, it's really an underlying layer. Right? You have to deeply personalize it at every point. 308 00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:26.860 Ivylevel: right? And I think, whether it be your Cs projects, or whether it be your videography, I think the more you bring your cultural identity and your identity and personalize it, it's it's always good. 309 00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:51.809 Jenny Duan: Is it fair to say that it's more like an underlying layer that cuts across everything. Yeah, I would agree. And so right now, like what I'm trying to do, for Huda is giving her more opportunities to platform her work. I think that's the main thing, like platforming your work and getting recognition for what you're doing, because, you know, I feel like you're very humble like you don't really like to take ownership or recognition for your work, but it's really important, too, because you're so skilled. 310 00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:52.740 Like. 311 00:58:52.780 --> 00:59:15.080 Jenny Duan: honestly, most of the people who make it are not the people who are the smartest. They're really not not the people who work the hardest people who can do the best at presenting themselves. And that's like a really hard truth, because we want to see like the smartest and most talented people succeed. That's not often the case, because it's often times and people who can express their work the best you can communicate it with other people. Those are the people who 312 00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:42.730 Jenny Duan: gain the recognition. And so that's not necessarily right. But that's the way that the world is. So right now, what we're working together on is the reason why, we're applying for things like the Nc. With sc. Like women and computing aspirations and computing award or bank of America. Student leaders or Notre Dame leadership seminars is to give you a platform and to add credibility because you've already done the work. Now, you just need someone to recognize that you've done the work. 313 00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:46.020 huda: Does that matter? Does that make sense like? Ultimately 314 00:59:46.310 --> 01:00:09.379 Jenny Duan: the value in your work comes from yourself? But you also need other people to see it into like, recognize that. So you can add more credibility to you. Because if you say like, okay, I'm like a really good game developer, everyone's gonna be like cool. But if 10 other people will say that okay, who? That? You're a really good game developer, then that like, adds another layer of credibility. 315 01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:30.830 Jenny Duan: But I think. Be careful with this, because you don't want to be chasing other people's validation, for your whole life like this is, that's not the goal here, but the goal here is just to have other people recognize your work so you can get a platform and like, demonstrate that on your application. It's a game plan. It's a gamified system. Let's be honest, right? I mean, you're a gamer. You're developing games. So that right? How can you not know this like you have to play by the rules. Right? 316 01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:44.960 Ivylevel: So I'm glad that I think lot of these things are coming across. I know we are running out of the hour. But let me just wrap this up. In fact, what you're just telling me is. And and and just last thing is, where does this go Jenni. 317 01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:57.389 Ivylevel: Eventually, the way this manifests in the 2 min that these application officers are actually reviewing your application like, it's just the funny part, right all these 4 years. And all this hard work, you know, eventually comes down to this thing 318 01:00:57.430 --> 01:01:09.559 Ivylevel: and they'll. I think one thing is your essay critically important. That's why everyone wants to spend money and narrative. That's a narrative and narrative, and that's personality of who you are. It doesn't have to do anything with your 319 01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:17.770 Ivylevel: academics or anything else. But then the other things is where the activity list, right? Where do they see this proof of work? 320 01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:19.480 Ivylevel: Here's my question to you. 321 01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.920 Ivylevel: where do they see the proof of work? How do they do the do they Google search you like, how do they verify it? 322 01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:44.150 Jenny Duan: They don't have time. They just look at what you write about yourself. That's what I'm like. It's kind of big, because, honestly, people like rely on their application all the time, like the most common lies. People have an Instagram account, and they call a nonprofit. That's like, so everyone does that. That's like a big lie like there's lots of 323 01:01:44.350 --> 01:02:02.920 Jenny Duan: they. They can't know the only way they can note letters and recommendations. That's why they really care. Letters. Recommendations are honestly, very, very undervalued. Those are really important, and people don't pay enough attention to their relationship with their teachers, because that's one of the best ways they can get validation about what kind of student you are. They reach your letters, recommendation. They look at your activities. 324 01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:18.019 Jenny Duan: your activities, they only looking for like the type of activities that you do. If you hold leadership positions, what kind of impact you've made bullet points. I have 100 people in my club, or I raise $30,000, or I built 5 325 01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:48.119 Jenny Duan: XYZ. You know they're looking for the concrete number numbers, and then awards. The awards are is another very valuable thing because awards you apply, and someone else has already judged you at that point. So, for example, if you win coca Cola scholarship, that organization, a very reputable organization has already judged you. And so the colleges, because they trust that organization they can trust that organization is judging you. So that's why awards are so important because it's like another layer of validation that, like you are a good student. Because. 326 01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:56.080 Jenny Duan: if someone else thinks that you're a good student, then the college is, gonna think that you are a good zoom because they trust that middle party. Does that make sense? 327 01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.290 Yeah. 328 01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:24.809 huda: I wanted to update you like, I know we're running short on time. But so I've kind of tried to been be like more frequent on my social media account. Yeah, I posted like a few reels, and a few of them are actually like, doing pretty good. And apparently like, okay, I don't know if this is that grand? But it says I've reached like a a thousand like non followers. 329 01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:33.940 huda: And it's kind of like a big step. And I think also, for for once, like, my content is kind of going out towards like 330 01:03:33.940 --> 01:04:01.099 huda: other game developers as well cause my other videos. Usually they just kind of like target, like people that I know or like just random people. But for the first time, I think, like, my content is actually going out to people that I want my content to go out to. So like, that's kind of something that I've been happy about this week. 331 01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:16.129 Jenny Duan: I think, is very inspiring and also motivating, because, like, if you don't have other game developers in your life, you don't really know, like what the game developing community is thinking about what kinds of opportunities are out there. But once you start connecting with other game developers, they can kind of direct you in the 332 01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:21.099 Jenny Duan: direction that you need to be. You know, in terms of 333 01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:33.519 Jenny Duan: different opportunities to publish your games, you know potential users things like that 334 01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:40.439 Ivylevel: probably like knows that a lot of things that I say, too, but it's good to hear this validation coming from you and 335 01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.530 Ivylevel: helping us align as well. Great, I think. 336 01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:53.310 Ivylevel: yeah. So let's continue on this. I think you have your game plan. I think what I'm gonna do is also like, you know, craft. 337 01:04:53.380 --> 01:05:16.990 Ivylevel: What you've just done is actually you're again highlighted. A few things are critically important, very outcome, driven like letter of recommendation. Strategy. Right? Your Ap. Strategy your you know proof of work like, you know, everyone keeps talking about extracurricular passion project. Blah, blah, blah blah blah! You know Julie came, and all that stuff. No one talks about this important thing which really matters at the end of the day. Right? 338 01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.680 Ivylevel: So I think 339 01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:23.310 Ivylevel: this is how we we can really like help these students. So 340 01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:44.800 Jenny Duan: it's not. It's not bad who the see, like, you know, who does literally like, you know, she was yesterday, like, you know, yeah, II just can't like get into these schools anymore, like I'm done. It's never over and like you should never be the person to tell yourself, no, never tell yourself. No. If they if an admissions officer wants to tell you no that's up to them, but shouldn't be up to you. 341 01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:52.730 huda: So like, okay, so I know. I know it's like it's still possible. But like. 342 01:05:52.950 --> 01:06:11.079 huda: if compared to Stanford, like, would Usc, be more like accepting of people with bees or like do you think it's like just the same like, kinda like, obviously like you said, it's possible if I keep trying. But like, I just wanna see like 343 01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:24.889 Ivylevel: is Usc, like more accepting to like, I sorry to interrupt. Yeah, I think we? Let's respect her time. I think it's already quite late. Even though I would love to show you the a glimpse of the site that we're going to launch tomorrow morning 1030. 344 01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:44.090 Ivylevel: But I think what I want to do is wanna have another session where? Let's go through college list. And Huda I want, you know again. Sorry. I've been a bit assertive, and you see, like this is the bad side of me as a dad Jenni, a bit more assertive here like I want you to take like what? The model of the story for me. Here, here is this Huda, right 345 01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.579 Ivylevel: like you shouldn't be like thinking and valuing yourself just through the lens of B. 346 01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:57.699 Ivylevel: You're not just a B right, that's word like Ja, that's the model of the story to me doesn't mean that you. You can live with B. You have to fix it. 347 01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:04.680 Ivylevel: But that is just one small data point. Think about it like you're you. You are so unique for the 348 01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.960 Ivylevel: and the other thing that Jenny has really highlighted. 349 01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:16.240 Ivylevel: I mean, this is a land of you know you fake it till you make it. Unfortunately, I mean, don't you know the power of narratives with 350 01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:22.479 Ivylevel: Don't you know the power of narratives? That's what's happening today. Whoever's got the strongest narrative wins right 351 01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:39.080 Ivylevel: like. So you you have to build your like. And and I think you know th, this is a pro. And this is very unfair Jenny, because there are a lot of brilliant minds, and students, unfortunately, are unable to showcase their work, and especially more the analytical and stem folks like, you know, Cs, and 352 01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:51.009 Ivylevel: right amazing, like technical skills. But they are not able to showcase themselves because of the communication gap and stuff like that. So so ku kudos and thanks a lot for bringing that out. 353 01:07:51.610 --> 01:08:01.589 Ivylevel: yeah, I think next week, let's I think, college list Maddy. And I've been discussing every parent till the last moment. Everyone's just talking about college list. 354 01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:05.090 Ivylevel: I have been glued on to these Facebook groups. 355 01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:13.069 Ivylevel: and I can tell you that by the day EAED. December, Jan. College list, college list, college list number one. 356 01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:17.950 Ivylevel: It's all about college list. It's never over. So I think. 357 01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:31.150 Ivylevel: I'm I'm you know. II can really now correlate with all the initial micro services that you had actually built. Right? It's it's very clear that major. Those kind of things are very important. So let's focus on college list next session. 358 01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:38.250 Ivylevel: And find, you know, a good session, so you know, she can still make it to Stanford. So you see, like, although it's not over for you, so 359 01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:44.910 Ivylevel: don't. Yeah. But I think more important, I would say, is like your narrative should be very clear, and you need to work backwards 360 01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:58.609 Ivylevel: right? I think ideally. You know what I'm thinking is, Jenny. We, the the part of our game plan is to give them a future. You right? What is your profile? What is your narrative that you're giving? Right? This is this is, go and stick it on your wall. 361 01:08:58.649 --> 01:09:06.580 Ivylevel: And now you're working backwards. You need to work on it. Work on it to achieve that profile, to make it to these dream schools. That's what it is. 362 01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:08.450 Ivylevel: Your narrative. 363 01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.970 huda: So yeah. 364 01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:33.350 Jenny Duan: cool. Well, yeah, thanks again. We'll schedule another session and break through it soon. But what I wanted to just give you the take away is like it's always upwards. Trajectory in your mindset is the most thing that matters like a push that's in your control. If you can control it, you can do it. You can't change the past. But you can change the future, you know. 365 01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.380 Jenny Duan: Anyways. 366 01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:37.510 Jenny Duan: talk to you soon. Thanks again. 367 01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:47.200 Ivylevel: Yeah, I don't hold you. I think I'll send it to you tomorrow, because already quite late. That's fine. We'll spend time. But you've actually, I've learned a lot, and it's gonna be very helpful. 368 01:09:47.229 --> 01:10:09.869 Ivylevel: and Huta. You can do it. I think you have to do Sat, and then you have to nail it. So thanks a lot Jenny. Talk to you on Sunday. I'll set up some time. Sorry I've been late on a few things on your Pm. On your mentoring. I've been like pretty on time and all that stuff. So I really I really appreciate you being patient because I've been really like heads down, you know, and and hopefully you'll like it, and and we'll make some. 369 01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:12.850 Ivylevel: I think we are launching basically 3 services, Jenny. 370 01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:17.470 Ivylevel: One is now that we have this 6 weeks. You see, 2 weeks. 371 01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:27.580 Ivylevel: We want to do an application boost. We want to do an essay, elevate 500 $500 session, and we want to do, you know, and prep, you know, iv level prep, and all that. So you'll see. 372 01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:34.559 Ivylevel: I think it's it's good time for us, because peak of the moment till common app, Jan. First deadline. So 373 01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:37.369 Ivylevel: I think whatever you just said, it's amazing. 374 01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:41.180 Jenny Duan: Oh, take care, bye, bye.",

    "Week 7 - Coaching_Jenny_Huda_Wk07_2023-11-16_M_9c2bd28b502abb8aU_U_00-00-00 WEBVTT 1 00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.709 Ivylevel: Hello, though. 2 00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.670 huda: Hi, there, Iv, Lovell. 3 00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.310 Ivylevel: Yeah. 4 00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.870 Ivylevel: I think I will. Yeah, I'll probably like, you know, first half an hour 5 00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.680 Ivylevel: I will kind of. Ask a few things I'll 6 00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.149 Ivylevel: then I will let you guys go into. 7 00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.620 Ivylevel: I mean, what? What is the top things that you had any tactical things you wanted to discuss with Jenny 8 00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.300 huda: first, I wanna talk about options. Yeah. 9 00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.370 Jenny Duan: hey? How's it going? 10 00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.269 huda: Hi, I'm well, how are you? 11 00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.829 Jenny Duan: I'm doing? Well, yeah. Well, I thought we could just get started. Could you 12 00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:41.509 Jenny Duan: start before we go into our normal updates? I'd love to just talk a little bit about how your sat went, and how you feeling about that? Because again, like this, the jump in scores is a little bit. Yeah, surprising. Because I think before you took the sat. You're also scoring about the same right on the practice test, and then, unless it went down. But now you're back to what your standard was like before everything. Could you tell me a bit about how you're feeling with that? 13 00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.609 huda: Yeah. So again, I'm kind of like confused because this time, like 14 00:02:47.610 --> 00:03:15.359 huda: I definitely like had no distractions or anything while I was taking the test. And, in fact, for some of the sections. I like, I tried taking a test area where, like, they're kind of a few noises, and like, cause, you know, in like testing sites, it's kind of there's a few noises in the background. So I kinda wanna test that climate a",
    "nd the results like, honestly, they were the same as before when I took the sat. But one thing I'm like unsure about is 15 00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.250 huda: how like the jump itself like is kind of confusing me as well 16 00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.280 huda: like. 17 00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:38.620 huda: and also like reading or like math is like, definitely like a lot easier for me on these practice tests. I don't know if it's because, like, these questions are like easier or like I just know how to solve them better or like, maybe I'm less stressed. But. 18 00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.899 huda: I don't know. I just feels like a lot easier than normal, like the actual sat. 19 00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.630 Jenny Duan: Do you feel like the questions themselves were easier? Or do you just feel like you were more prepared? 20 00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:12.739 huda: I think I was more prepared, actually cause there are like some difficult questions on there, but like I felt like I knew how to do them. And then also, especially after since we practice like deriving geometry like like equations. We didn't know them. I think that's like something that helped me during the practice tests. But yeah, I think I definitely felt a little more prepared. 21 00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:23.599 Jenny Duan: Got it? Okay, cool. Can we go just briefly over some of the questions that you said you wanted to talk about like you said there were a couple of math questions right? And was there anything else that you wanted to go over. 22 00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:36.530 huda: I think the other sections were pretty fun for me. So sorry to interrupt. Here II joined Jenni. Actually, I wanted to actually take an opportunity today. 23 00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:48.750 Ivylevel: And I don't know what what's a good time. Probably you guys can spend some time on sat, but I think I would at least need like a half an hour. I think what I wanted to do was more like a check point. In 24 00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.619 Ivylev",
    "el: really kind of, II think. Let's just repeat the whole kind of game plan and roadmap for Houda again. 25 00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.530 Jenny Duan: because I think 26 00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.070 Ivylevel: you know, primarily 2 things here right? And I'm again like talking like a dad now. Not like a dad. I am a dad. 27 00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.119 Ivylevel: That's the debate I have always with Huda. 28 00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:15.399 Ivylevel: She's so upset with that. But I think there are 2 things right. In fact, 3 things. So one is number one. 29 00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.269 Ivylevel: I still feel that Hooda and I, as well as a parent. 30 00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:46.559 Ivylevel: I think just knowing why we are doing certain things. It's still there's a still significant gap there, right? I think the why it, you know, knowledge. And and I think that's that's clear, you know, like lot of lot of students, a lot of parents are not aware of it. Parents don't have time, and it really depends on, you know, students who are really like into it. You know, like you're you're an exception, for example, right now you've gone to Reddit, and you've really learned a lot of things. 31 00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.069 Ivylevel: I think a lot of students are not aware of that. So 32 00:05:49.140 --> 00:06:03.269 Ivylevel: II would love to ask us to kind of just kind of re revisit. And and you know, focus on these 3 areas of aptitude and passion. And you know the themes that we are working on that that's critically required from an evaluation perspective, right? So just to understand that first 33 00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.040 Ivylevel: second is also, like, you know, focusing a bit more on the college. And the major list is important. 34 00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.860 Ivylevel: I feel like, you know it's it's a good time. Where? 35 00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:23.230 Ivylevel: II you know, while I know that Huda has been doing lot of things, and she can continue doing that. But I want Hou",
    "da to like be very clear on. 36 00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:36.300 Ivylevel: You know, her target kind of schools and and programs, and there can be iteration and evolution, but at least at like 80%, she should be clear in her head. What she's aiming for. Why, she's working, you know, on a few things 37 00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:47.319 Ivylevel: that's 2, and then number 3 is, I know that there are a bunch of kind of tasks and goals and objectives that you have been working on in a very execution mode. 38 00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.109 Ivylevel: I would also want us to kind of reassess, revisit. Firstly, what pro progress has happened so far. 39 00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:08.480 Ivylevel: and really focus on a few things. No, might be, you know, if Huda is not able to handle a few few of those things, let's just eliminate them. You know, I want her to really like focus on the things where she can make an impact like, as an example, like, you know, Apa had a 40 00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:20.429 Ivylevel: you know, had a score kind of you know issue recently, like, I don't know if issues the right word. But I think Ap is kind of not working in a favor at this time. Right? So I would love to discuss that. 41 00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:32.299 Ivylevel: You know the the academic rigor. You know things things like that. So II want to do a holistic. Let's treat this kind of session as as a as a revisit. I would love to also, learn lot of things. 42 00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:40.309 Ivylevel: And I want HUD to also really start learning like why certain things are important, because unless she knows what the evaluation process is. 43 00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:52.959 Ivylevel: you know, it will be hard for her, like you know, she I don't want her to be like checklist follower, like. Oh, yeah, I've applied for this I applied for that I applied for I think she also needs to have a point of view 44 00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:14.850 Ivylevel: if she feels like oh, there are 3 programs that I've applied for. Yo",
    "u know. I want her to have that kind of point of view. And then I would love to have. That doesn't make sense, because I would love to do that. I feel like Huda has that gap, and I also like I don't have time. So I'm I'm so I would love you to kind of educate us a bit more. Let's draft her whole roadpap again. 45 00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.780 Ivylevel: and let's take some decisions. I'm perfectly fine. 46 00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:35.490 Ivylevel: you know, based on her current academics and her trajectory. Let's let's have a very brutally honest, you know I would love you to have a very brutally honest kind of assessment, and tell you know what her chances. What's our best bet to get into like, you know, one of the top schools, you know that that aligns with her, and things like that. Sorry there are too many things. 47 00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:40.049 Ivylevel: This is really the Iv level kind of game plan session. Let's do that again for Huda. 48 00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.869 Ivylevel: So and we can do like half a half session today. And we can do another half session later. 49 00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.120 Ivylevel: Does that make sense? 50 00:08:47.610 --> 00:09:10.180 Jenny Duan: Yeah, totally but do you want us to spend more time talking about this? Or would you like to go over the SAT. We can start with this and just do this forward and pause the SAT. For another time, or we can start with the SAT. And then, after we finish that, go to this, what do you prefer? I think maybe we could talk about the SAT. In a separate small fast. So maybe like a 30 min session. 51 00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:26.220 Jenny Duan: Okay? Sure. No problem. So let's just get that scheduled for the future. But let's focus on your game plan right now. So and you know, sorry. Jenni, again, like you know, think that I don't know anything. Okay. Think you're meeting us first time I would love you to really start afresh. 52 00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:36.560 Ivylevel: And might be. You can give us an upd",
    "ate like, you know. What? What do you think has been Hooda's journey. I know that you gave me a document as a as a product person as well like on on Houdas roadmap and evolution. 53 00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:47.859 Jenny Duan: And then I would love you to do an assessment, and, you know, start drafting a a game plan for Huda, and we can join. Do you work on it. Yeah, that makes sense. Sure. Yeah. Sounds good. So I guess 54 00:09:48.050 --> 00:10:11.010 Jenny Duan: what I would like to know is right now, at this point, you're still a junior your sat is come back. I think your sat is not at an optimal point for top schools, but I don't think that's like a major blocker. Because again, there's always the option to go test optional. But given that, your sat is a bit low. I think that is one like 55 00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:34.449 Jenny Duan: critical area. So I think I'm just gonna break it down from maybe like the most important to the least important things in the order of that the admissions officers look at. So the first major thing that they look at is your academics. So back to just checking in on your grades. How is that going for you this year? And how are your grade trajectory looking? Across high school? 56 00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:59.050 huda: Okay, so this is something that, I think is one of my weaknesses. Actually, so like I've had so far, I've actually had 3 B's and throughout. And I feel like there's a really high likeliness that I'm gonna get another. Be this semester for apus history, I'm like working on retaking some 57 00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:13.159 huda: like tests and stuff. But II really it's kind of like a low chance that I can get a. And I'm working really hard. I'm trying to persuade this teacher, and I've had her for like 2 years. And actually, last year I was able to like 58 00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:30.899 huda: kind of persuade her, I mean, like, obviously, I was close to an A, but I was like, Get an 89.9, and then she was able to round it. So I'm lik",
    "e trying, like my hardest to persuade her, but I'm not sure how high it's looking from here. So I'm not sure if I'll be able to get an a this semester 59 00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.080 huda: in a push. Yeah, but 60 00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:48.649 huda: usually like my trends and grades that I get like one B during the first semester and then and second semester full. A's that's how it's been like the past few years or the past 2 years. 61 00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.549 huda: that's kind of like the pattern of my grades. Yeah. 62 00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. What other classes have you received these in? 63 00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:09.250 huda: So honors biology for? First semester and then for sophomore year? Ap human geography 64 00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.849 huda: and chemistry. 65 00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.780 Jenny Duan: This is all for semester. 66 00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.360 huda: Oh, yeah. And then always for the second semester. 67 00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.129 Jenny Duan: Cool and then. just in general, what is your Gpa. 68 00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:31.349 huda: I think last time I checked like waited was like 4 point like 69 00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.630 huda: a 70 00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:43.619 huda: like I wanna say, last time I checked last year was 4.2 but unweighted. I think it's like 3 point 71 00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:51.359 huda: 3 9, maybe 3 or something like that in that range. 72 00:12:51.400 --> 00:13:00.910 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then the total number of aps that you've taken is api human geography, a push. And what's the total number of Aps and honors? 73 00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.190 huda: So far? It honors as well. 74 00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:14.069 huda: 8 Ap's and honors so far. How many are offered at your school? 75 00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.569 huda: Aps, I think 76 00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:32.360 huda: 18. But Ap's. I'm trying to take more next year. I think I'm gonna I'm planning for 4 right now for like ap environmental science,",
    " ap literature. 77 00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:38.639 huda: ap site. And there's one more I'm forgetting. Oh, I think 78 00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:45.110 huda: actually, I'm forgetting. But I was planning for 4 Ap's next year 79 00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:53.250 Jenny Duan: got it, and then out of the 8 ap honors classes you've taken. How many of those are Ap's and how many are honors? 80 00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.620 huda: 3 honors and 5 Aps. 81 00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.749 Jenny Duan: Got it. Okay. 82 00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:15.170 Jenny Duan: okay, so do you know, you don't have class rank? Right? Okay, cool and then SATP. SAT. 83 00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.230 Jenny Duan: You do have plans to take the act at all. 84 00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:25.460 huda: I was thinking after this sat no matter the score. I think I want to try the act at least once. 85 00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.210 Jenny Duan: Have you taken an act practice test yet? 86 00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.839 huda: I have. I think I got a 29 on that one. 87 00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.230 Jenny Duan: Okay? And what do? Why do you want to take the act? 88 00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.839 huda: I feel like the A CT, 89 00:14:39.850 --> 00:15:03.140 huda: although there's like a whole science section which is kind of intimidating me at first. I feel like the reading sections are a lot more straightforward as well as the math questions. And generally it's kind of considered easier. Not saying it is. But like, I think it's like more of my it could be a different testing test taking style. 90 00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:12.170 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, we'll leave that up to there. Okay? So then, so the first block of things that your 91 00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:23.450 Jenny Duan: evaluator will evaluate you on is academics, and this includes, you know, your your grades, test scores and your letters of recommendation. 92 00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:30.170 Jenny Duan: and the reason why that teachers want to look at this or schools want to look at",
    ". This is to see if you can 93 00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:43.379 Jenny Duan: like, if you would be a good academic fit for that institution. So they don't want you to fail. They want you to be successful at their institution, and that's what they use your academic performance to measure. 94 00:15:43.720 --> 00:16:08.780 Jenny Duan: I think right off. The bat. Having 3 B's is a big limiting factor. That's not to say that it's going to be the factor. I know that it's not something you can control at this point. So that's something that you know, we moving forward. It's really important to like, be on that upward trajectory. But I think I mean it's not. It's out of your control right now. But I think that having 3 B's will be a significant 95 00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:16.670 Ivylevel: let. Yeah, let's spend some time on this right. And I think you know, this is also like for 96 00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:24.959 Ivylevel: II think the this is like again, a very objective and and brutally honest kind of assessment. And the reason is very simple 97 00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.180 Ivylevel: that 98 00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:37.329 Ivylevel: I think we decide, and we focus on things that can really contribute, and that we can control moving forward and land in the best possible. And you know, maximize the best place where Huda can land. 99 00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:44.090 Ivylevel: And you know, because there's no point right like th. And this is where the fundamental issue is, where, when you don't understand. 100 00:16:44.250 --> 00:17:01.289 Ivylevel: like, it is morally challenging. You know it creates anxiety and stress on parents, on student. And they feel like, Okay, II absolutely have no chance now anymore, like, I'm done. So le so I want to also compare this with some of the discussions that we had, and this is also from my knowledge. So 101 00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.830 Ivylevel: no. 102 00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:10.940 Ivylevel: this is what does this entail everything that? You know,",
    " when we say aptitude. 103 00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:16.589 Ivylevel: is this like the the aptitude, or or is there anything else that's also a part of aptitude. 104 00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.579 There's also 105 00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:37.180 Jenny Duan: like prestigious awards. And but I don't think that that is something that right now who does necessarily eligible, for, because that's more like if you do signs fair, or if you win like math counts, or if you win something like that, but that's like, if you haven't been preparing for that since 106 00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:55.500 Jenny Duan: middle school. Then that's like, not necessarily something. So I think I think I think again, like you know, sorry for my ignorance. But I really want to understand this right? So really, the first theme and the main bucket is about your aptitude. And academic is actually the fundament the the core part of that aptitude 107 00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.830 Jenny Duan: and everything else like one is great test scores. 108 00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.659 Ivylevel: It's really to prove that. You know, your academic excellence correct. 109 00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:16.460 huda: Gp. 110 00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:24.789 Ivylevel: okay, so so I think, yeah. So I think, grades are critically important to and also to show that 111 00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:41.230 Ivylevel: your I'm again, like, I'm trying to understand the the meaning of aptitude here. Right? It's really around your subjects, your curriculum, your basic stem. It's very focused. It's it's it's it's absolutely not about extracurriculars. Correct. It's really your curriculum. 112 00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.730 Jenny Duan: that's what absolutely 113 00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.440 Jenny Duan: right. And and say, for example, you know, if there is 114 00:18:47.470 --> 00:19:05.459 Ivylevel: kind of Ssp, research. You know program that. Who that makes into that would also fall into aptitude correct because it proves her skill for for research. An",
    "d okay, great. So the more credentials you add there, right? And I think, that's one. And as you said that. 115 00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:13.279 Ivylevel: how does any admission officer actually evaluate the the strength 116 00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:21.189 Ivylevel: or like, how would you actually give this score to this particular pillar, like, you know, academic rigor was one of them. So what are the main signals here? 117 00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:31.019 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So the the main thing that they would look at is the rigor of your school. So given that your school has 18 Ap's. That's 118 00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:54.239 Jenny Duan: quite a lot. So I mean, that gives good credentials that you're like coming from a rigorous institution. However, with that, then they would look at your Gpa. And seeing how you do compared to other students in your school and given that you have 3 B's that I mean, they don't rank. They don't rank, but they do have access to previous admin students from your school and other people who are applying. 119 00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:08.639 Jenny Duan: So if you have 3 B's and someone has maybe all A's, that's not to say that you're not an eligible candidate. They're just seeing that like you're not as strong in maybe these areas as another student. That doesn't mean that they won't admit you. That's just something that they'll take note of. 120 00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:27.230 Jenny Duan: And I'm not saying that 3 B's is like you won't get into any school. I think my roommate had 3 B's, and she's at Stanford, so it's not like, you know, awesome. I think that's precisely the kind of you know, profiles you wanna focus on right? Because. 121 00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:34.549 Ivylevel: to be very honest, like, just see, II wanna walk you through the experience here. And the pain point right? So Huda comes and tells me about this yesterday. 122 00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:40.049 Ivylevel: right? And me as a parent. Absolutely no idea about how the grading system ",
    "works here. 123 00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:45.049 despite spending 8 months. And I'm ashamed to say that like because I never focus on grades. 124 00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:55.460 Ivylevel: I don't understand a bit of it, and to me it's already a bummer. I'm like what what like, you know. And then I go back to her. And I said, like, why did you? Why did you take this? Ap? Then? Right? 125 00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:03.970 Ivylevel: Oh, yeah. Because, you know, I had to show rigor. And you know, II discussed with Jenny and I came. I'm like now then, the question is 126 00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:10.710 Ivylevel: like, What if she did not take a piece? And she had, like, you know, her stead, she probably would have got like A's right. 127 00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:21.890 Ivylevel: So like my. My point is, there is one student now who hasn't taken Aps who doesn't show the rigor, but has a very good Gpa. Right? Because the and so how do you compare these 2 things? Now? 128 00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.280 Ivylevel: You have to have a good Gpa in difficult classes. 129 00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:35.110 Jenny Duan: It's yeah, it's really challenging. It's not like, you can have a. It's like you have to have both like. 130 00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:44.519 Jenny Duan: I think if it's it's not. If a student with bad like 3.5 Gpa. Is with assuming with the 4 point Ogpa, who doesn't take 131 00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.299 Jenny Duan: any a piece. It's not like one of them is going to get admitted. It's they're both gonna get rejected. 132 00:21:49.310 --> 00:22:06.219 Ivylevel: Does that make sense? So it's not like a comparison which one's better. It's they're both gonna get rejected. Okay, okay, so basically, what you're saying is like number one, not taking Ap is not an option for good schools. Number one. Is that a correct score? Unless your school doesn't have any Ap's. 133 00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.699 Jenny Duan: then it won't be put against you. But if your school offers a piece and you don't take",
    " them. That's 134 00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:20.160 Jenny Duan: red flag. But also Huda does. Huda school doesn't have lot of Ap's correct 18 is a lot. 18 is quite a bit, actually. 135 00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:35.599 Ivylevel: Oh, okay, I thought that, Huda. Actually, you know, there were not many like, because there there isn't that culture of Ap's in in Houdas school, and I thought that they were not offering, but looks like, you know. I'm sorry for my ignorance here, but I really want to understand this. So you're saying, Okay, good 136 00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.510 Ivylevel: So I think. 137 00:22:38.100 --> 00:23:01.099 Ivylevel: there's definitely a a, a kind of a risk right with with a student like, you know, who doesn't have that rigor. And they're trying to really do this for the first time. Or you know, there's always a risk. I mean, I'm not even saying about like Non. Look at Victoria as an example. Right? Like she's amazing. She's done all these research. She has got 2. B's right in Ap. Math, and she's applying for astrophysics, and she's published some amazing papers. Think about it 138 00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:10.089 Ivylevel: right but having to be as an astrophysics candidate in mathematics Ap. Or 2. She got a 2 just recently. 139 00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:35.489 Jenny Duan: The Ap. Scores don't matter that much. You don't have to report that unless you want to, and you can retake every year, so so does the Ap. Score like, does it help you in your application? Or is it just there for like credit. When you go to college, it helps you in your application. If, for example, you get a be in a class, but you get a 5 on the Ap test. That shows that you understand the content, which is what they care about. 140 00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:53.940 huda: Okay, yeah. I go to 5 on my Ap hug, exam, despite like having a be in the first semester. So yeah, I feel like, that's that's fine. Yeah. So now let's talk about what is the mitigation and fixing strategy. Right? I want to go r",
    "eally detail into this, because this is a problem that many students have. Jenny 141 00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:11.529 Ivylevel: having a bee 1 s, I'm gonna switch to this another screen. Because so I'm just gonna switch devices. Really, 1 s, no worries. This is very helpful. And Hoda, you also please feel free to jump in, because II really wow. 142 00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:26.559 Jenny Duan: that's not your room. You're still working late. This is the study study room in my the Wi-fi in my room as who to knows? It's not good. It's very laggy, so I'm now taking my meetings in a different room where the Wi-fi is much better. Yeah. 143 00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:55.039 Jenny Duan: See who the I mean. Like you're sign. I mean getting into Stanford is is just the beginning. It's it's it's it's a jail. Okay, you need to just keep learning. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. You'll enjoy but yeah. So I think Victoria's situation is a little bit different. But I think in this situation like, since you got a 5 on that test that shows them that you understand the material. So that's something that you should definitely put on your application. And it's not just, you know, for credit. So they under know that you understand the material. So that's good. 144 00:24:55.050 --> 00:25:08.660 Ivylevel: Okay. So let's do this now, like Jenni, I'm I'm telling, like, you know. Imagine that I come to you like we we are meeting for the first time like next year, when Huda is applying right, and we are going to do that. We are. We are launching this, and I'm kind of mixing both. 145 00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:18.349 Ivylevel: There are a lot of students who are gonna come and say, like, these are my weak spot number one. My grades aren't perfect, but I've done some great things in life. Right? III have an amazing narrative. 146 00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:29.289 Ivylevel: I've really shown a great trajectory rigor and all that stuff. But I have 3 Bs or 4 Bs. so let's work on a strategy like for Huddana. What concret",
    "ely can Hudar do? What is the game plan here? 147 00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:38.419 Ivylevel: Because this is clearly a red flag. Right? You have said that this is a red flag, because when I compare, like another of students who are like all straight A's perfect scores. 148 00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:57.210 Ivylevel: but there is also this counter argument that being like too perfect, is not the goal right? We that that you have to show, standing out like just having a perfect grade is your very more requirement. But that is not the guy. And and and I would love to actually talk to your roommate like, you know, would love to ha understand like you know, what? 149 00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:18.159 Ivylevel: What did she do to change that game? And that is to me very inspiring story, right like, how do you change the game from 3 B's so so fix this for me. Now, right like I've come to you as a dad very vulnerable like. You know me, my daughter. I'm like, okay. She's got other things. Might be she's got an award, might be. She made it to like launch. I don't know like we'll be, because there is still hope to do that. 150 00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.599 Ivylevel: but sorry. No control. She's got 3 B's. What will you do? 151 00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:42.830 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Well, I would say, first of all, emphasizing in your narrative, like what other, what other things make you more special or more distinct from other students like, what about your background? Makes you a really good fit for this school? And what and what about you makes make it so that you can be academic. 152 00:26:42.830 --> 00:27:07.079 Jenny Duan: academically successful at this institution. And what else do you bring that maybe isn't reflected in your transcript, because, as you know, like the grades aren't the most important. I mean, they are very important, but they're not the only important thing about a student like they have a story. They have other aspects of their character that they can bring, and like em",
    "phasizing those other things, I think also, if you have poor grades, but a very strong test score that can help balance it out. 153 00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:32.059 Ivylevel: yeah. So that would be one thing I would say like, if you are senior, I would say you should take a test, and you need to get this scroll. And how is it different for Houda now? Okay, senior, I get it like, you know, it's already too late. She can't change anything now. Who does got these 3 Ap's sorry, I mean, I sorry for my ignorance again. I don't know like, you know I still don't get the difference between Ap. And the Transcript score. Probably it looks like, you know, Ap is optional. I can share it or not. 154 00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:48.559 Ivylevel: But transcript is something that's on the record. You can't just like. It's immutable record. It's already there. You can't just like, you know, erase it, or you can't change it anymore. Right? So what can Hudar do? Specifically? Now that you know these subjects? Tell me something very like, you know, a concrete plan as to. How can Houda 155 00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.359 Ivylevel: fix or enhance or mitigate these things apart from like just on the grading? 156 00:27:53.420 --> 00:28:02.689 Ivylevel: Forget about you know the test scores right. Any anything that she can do, or it's completely gone now out of out of her control. Well, the semester is not over. Do you have finals? 157 00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.649 huda: Yeah. If you get a hundred on your final, we can a in the class. 158 00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:22.809 huda: So we have like unit tests. Actually, instead of the final. So it's kind of weighted the same. But if I were to add, like a few retakes, that I could get cause here, if you get like just anything below a 90 you can score up to a 90. So I got like an 80 on my test 159 00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:34.869 huda: and then maybe I can like retake that to get a higher score, and then, if I if I do all my assignments and I get to a 90, then that'",
    "s the only possibility of me getting an a 160 00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.189 Jenny Duan: so that sounds like a plan, then. 161 00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.909 huda: Yeah, but I don't know how like 162 00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.869 huda: possible. You told me yesterday there was no plan, and now you're giving me a plan. I don't understand. 163 00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:52.799 Ivylevel: Yeah. So I think I think there is there. So I think again the freshman and sophomore is gone right. It's a done deal. 164 00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.260 Ivylevel: You can change that. 165 00:28:54.300 --> 00:29:12.610 Ivylevel: And I think one one pattern that Huda has highlighted is she always gets these things at the beginning of the semester, and she ends up in an A at the end. So there is that upward trajectory, and I would still love to know, like, you know why that happens. And she did the same thing this time as well, and I don't know why that that's the recurring pattern here. Right? 166 00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:40.859 Jenny Duan: But sometimes for me, like I can only push myself if I'm kind of in like this underdog mentality where I'm like, okay, I did bad. But so now I have to do better. But I don't know if you feel that way, because I think the first semester you don't have that pressure where you're like. I need to do better. But I think in the second semester, if you don't do well in the first semester, then you have like I need to do better, and then you do. I don't know. Experience that sometimes it happens for me between like a midterm and a final 167 00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.630 huda: yeah, for sure. 168 00:29:42.650 --> 00:30:12.539 huda: I think one thing is like in the first semester, at least, like the courses are really different. For example, like I took ap human geography the year previous, and then we only had to do like simple Frqs. But this year we have, like essays which are like really different to me at least. And then it's like definitely like a lot more differen",
    "t from before. And I think in the second semester you kinda get used to like the way of taking those tests like the way of like learning 169 00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.299 huda: in those classes, and like you kind of get better at that. But 170 00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:28.809 huda: I don't know. I think that's just like how I learned. But I needed. I knew, like, fix that in this semester. So yeah, okay, so, Huda, you said that you have like 3 already. And this was the fourth. B, correct. 171 00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:36.830 Ivylevel: Yeah, okay, so what I'm hearing is that you still have an opportunity to correct the fourth B into an A, 172 00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:48.950 huda: I'd have to. 173 00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.549 Ivylevel: And why is that hard? 174 00:30:53.750 --> 00:31:02.469 huda: Well, I don't know. Just like the tests in general, the retics in general really difficult. Okay? And and this is like history. Yeah, ap, history. 175 00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:14.449 Ivylevel: okay? And and okay, so that's number one. Okay, so at least you have a plan there. The next thing is, what are the things not to do right? Because she's already got this thing like, I think the things that she cannot afford 176 00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:21.650 Ivylevel: to do moving forward is to get another B, and how do you avoid that? And I think that's something that we need to discuss as well. 177 00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:47.219 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think the key to that is like looking at your study habits and how you study. This is, I think, very individual and depending on the person like in your habits, like, if you tend to procrastinate, then fixing that if you tend to not do assignments on time facing that, if you maybe just have struggles with a material or content, then you know you schedule office hours with your teacher, you get peer advising 178 00:31:47.220 --> 00:32:02.689 Jenny Duan: from your friends. You get tutor. If you really don't understand, you look at Khan Academy. T",
    "here's lots of things you can do once you identify the root cause of the issue. If you're not memorizing things well, maybe you need to sleep more. You know it is very dependent on the person and what 179 00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:18.139 Jenny Duan: the issues are causing are caused in their life. I think, for me, for example, some issues that I experience with my grades is I'm a procrastinator, which means I don't study until the day before the test. And then that's not really an effective way to study. And I recognize that, but 180 00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:29.149 Jenny Duan: that like impacts my grades. And so, but for other people, it's, you know, very different. Like some people. They don't understand the content. They they don't understand the lectures, and then they will get a tutor to fix that. 181 00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:46.659 Jenny Duan: and like in high school in my classes for me math is very challenging. I got tutors like I worked with other students. I found ways to learn the content because I didn't understand it from lecture. So it really depends on, I think, what you think your issue is, and then going in to fix that sort of on an individual level. 182 00:32:47.190 --> 00:33:04.079 Jenny Duan: But I think that, like definitely high school grades are something that should be achievable with time and hard work. I think that you're not gonna encounter any material in high school that you really don't know how to do. I think, April, especially if you can memorize the content. 183 00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:10.229 Jenny Duan: you just memorize it and imply on the test that maybe that means you need to study 2 weeks in advance before every test. 184 00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:23.299 Jenny Duan: But that's something that you can do. It's very. It's very much something that is in your capacity. So I feel like you shouldn't feel like it's something that's out of your reach, because this is content and material that you're very capable of doing. 185 00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:",
    "33.569 Ivylevel: Yeah. And I'm I'm really want, like, you know again, like see? Again, Mike noticed, because I absolutely have no idea how is this calculated? And you know, like it's it's a cumulative kind of score. You see like, how. 186 00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:49.340 Ivylevel: Imagine a person like me like you know, who spent so much time on this? I have no clue about it like this is this is the limited knowledge of parents, right? Because we don't understand, especially migrant parents. Here. I think tutoring as an example. I don't know why. Why haven't we taken any tutoring yet? Right to the 187 00:33:49.500 --> 00:34:06.379 Ivylevel: I think these are the kind of things that I would love to see, like, you know, might be putting a game plan here number one fixing the Ap. History, but also anticipating which other Ap's. Are you thinking that you might end up getting a B, then right 188 00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:16.510 Ivylevel: preparing for that. So yeah. So tutoring is clearly an extra. I'm looking at like, what extra support can Hooda get right? So tutoring is is important, like, you know, 1 one good mean 189 00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:20.590 Ivylevel: any other tools and techniques and tips. Jenny. 190 00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:41.040 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think like just making a good study plan and be on top of study habits is something that is very challenging to develop. I recognize that. But I think, like for test taking and stuff that's very much in your control? With a push test. Are they like memorization? Are you writing? Dbqs? What are you doing in your test. That is difficult for you. 191 00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:57.339 huda: I think just generally like the topics are really like widespread. And it covers like, really like wide topics, so like Mc. Queues and sausage are both kind of difficult for me, but mainly saues I struggle with the most 192 00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:24.959 huda: because it's kinda hard to think about like a specific example on the spot, especia",
    "lly when there's like one thing you've been setting for. And then like. And then you just get the question based on something really different. It's like, kind of like, especially, we go to her we call it success session. But basically office hours and then she kinda like hints at what's gonna be on the test. And sometimes she hints on the wrong things, throw us off. And so like 193 00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:51.089 Jenny Duan: that was kind of like off putting one we had that. But yeah, well, I think you can just do more sa que? That's like the best way to practice is, look at previous tests. The good thing about a push is like all the past tests have been released. So if you literally go from like the beginning of when a push was started to. Now, or go from now to the beginning, you can look at all the previous and just do more practice. 194 00:35:51.100 --> 00:36:16.200 Jenny Duan: And then eventually you'll just be more familiar with every concept. But, for example, with understanding concepts and connecting them, maybe you can find a way that works for you to like connect different topics across different a push errors, for example, making mind maps, making tables, visualizing it in different forms like, I think if you look online, I like April study tips and advice like, you'll probably find a lot of people breaking it down of. You know how you can best prepare for a push. 195 00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:32.700 Jenny Duan: How you can better study how you can better organize the content review, etc. And so I think that again, I feel like getting your very much in your capacity, and also what's challenging about the assignments? That you feel like it's difficult to get 90 on 196 00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:44.089 huda: they're all like retakes, really, and like honestly, I think the thing is well, first of all, like I told my teacher how I needed to do like multiple retakes 197 00:36:44.090 --> 00:37:09.619 huda: and she kind of like she's like, you don't have to do that. Yo",
    "u're it's fine if you have a B, but I told her I need an A and she's like she kind of tried to restrict me from taking multiple retakes. But you know, I just said like II don't think it's fair that you're limiting me from doing that. And so like, now, I'm gonna retake like 4 different tests. But I think what's diff difficult about that is just like 198 00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:31.820 huda: there units from like far back and then till now. And I think it's just the like. I said that the contents really like widespread. I think if I spend more time on it, like maybe do some research and watch videos and stuff and redo my notes. Basically. I might be able to like, revisit those things and maybe get a higher score. 199 00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:43.799 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. One channel that I really like on Youtube is Heimar's history. I'm gonna put that in the chat. But he makes really good. He's like another teacher that makes really good a push reviews. 200 00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:51.410 Jenny Duan: So I recommend watching his videos. But I think that you know, if if all you need to do is. 201 00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:55.220 Jenny Duan: you know, do redo 4 tests to get a I feel like that's very much 202 00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:10.500 Jenny Duan: in your capacity and to do to take the Ap test. Anyways, you're going to have to review it from the beginning. So maybe you can just think about this like you reviewing for the Ap test, because you'll need to know everything for the beginning, for the real test, anyways. 203 00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:18.099 Ivylevel: Okay? Oh, okay. So first thing is like for her to just retake. And that is not even ap right, that is, 204 00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:43.570 Ivylevel: that is just like her kind of regular class retakes to fix this right on the transcript. And then there is also an Ap. Exam towards the end, where she, if she gets a good score and and it's gonna be the same prep right? Whatever she prepares here is what's g",
    "onna help her. And if she gets a 5 there, that's actually a great story. Then right on showed the improvement amazing. And what do you mean by study plan? 205 00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.780 Ivylevel: Jenny, like. What? How would you define a good study plan? 206 00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.660 Jenny Duan: Well. 207 00:38:49.760 --> 00:39:13.579 Jenny Duan: I think what a bad study plan is, is just looking at your notes before the test. I feel like that doesn't help you at all. A study plan is just whatever method you use to review for an exam. Usually, that's like over a couple of days, like saying, Okay, I need to review these units here. And here I'm going to do X amount of practice problems. I'm gonna take X practice test. I'm going to use active recall, 208 00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:26.010 Jenny Duan: use other memory devices to help ensure that I know all this information. That's like a study plan. It's when you break down exactly how you're going to study and prepare for an exam instead of kind of doing whatever, and then going in blind. 209 00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:34.480 huda: And this what the tutor helps you with Jenny, like you said, you yourself have taken some tutors right like I haven't seen who that taking tutors. 210 00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.520 Ivylevel: I think she recently did one or 2 like math tutor for something. But. 211 00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:57.929 Ivylevel: like W. What does it to you to really help you with like. So I'm wondering. I mean, as part of this mentoring program. It's something like, you know, the value that like th, the information that you're actually giving now like, that's an integral part, right? Because it's an integral part of the college prep, too. Right? And and, for example, like, just like, forget about all the academics. 212 00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:13.770 Ivylevel: But for Hudar to really be on top of her ap you know the B grade. It's something that's pretty much within the limit of of a mentor here, right like you can really",
    " help her just like you're helping or or on sat as well. So I just wanna understand, like, you know, what does the tutor really do like, you know? Do they really help you with 213 00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:19.020 Ivylevel: kind of giving this kind of a study plan instead of a game plan for college prep. 214 00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:37.670 Jenny Duan: In my opinion. No. The reason why I had a tutor specifically for math is because I didn't understand what my teacher was saying in class. and so I needed to have someone else who, in my opinion was a better explainer. Just review the lecture with me, review the contents and just basically reteach me the material. 215 00:40:37.720 --> 00:41:02.699 Jenny Duan: But I think different people have different uses for tutors. That's the same thing with sat tutors. Some people on sat, and they're going to be teaching you content. Some other sat. Tutors are going to just be holding you accountable for your practice. So it really depends on what the students individual need is like. Some people can have a tutor to help them make study plans if that's what they need to do. But for me, I didn't really have any issues with studying was more understanding 216 00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:09.570 Jenny Duan: content. So it depends on what specific issue the student is experiencing. Then they can find someone to help them resolve that issue. 217 00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:28.560 Ivylevel: Yeah. And II definitely think that. You know, the teacher. The quality of teacher and the school also, like, you know, plays into this right. Those are some of the variable factors correct? You know how you know. So you know, whatever we can control, we should. And I would love to see who that really like, you know, change the game here. 218 00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:34.559 Ivylevel: I mean, that will be like II honestly like, you know, don't even care like you know where she eventually like, you know, lands, I think for me 219 00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:47.920 Ivylevel: the",
    "se small wins are more important, and these are like, you know, this is what will be will be very helpful. So so that's one I think. And 220 00:41:48.330 --> 00:42:01.520 Ivylevel: so, first fixing this Ap. And then whatever remaining Ap's are there, she needs to be on top of that. She needs to be top upgrades. I think she should probably have a goal that she's not getting any more like, you know. Be, I think that should be your kind of not star now, right 221 00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:04.879 Ivylevel: so being more like, you know, on top of it 222 00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:12.840 Ivylevel: great, then sat, as you rightly said, I think that becomes even more critical now, right? Because 223 00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:18.389 Ivylevel: that's the thing. Okay, cool aptitude. Now. 224 00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:26.020 Ivylevel: what are the other things that you had actually planned for the to boost her aptitude score. Right? So this is like grade. 225 00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:33.200 Ivylevel: You know, she you know she has to just be. II don't think we can do drastically anything different. She has to, just like, you know, do good 226 00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:39.699 Ivylevel: but sat. She has a great opportunity to really come up with like even a perfect score. Why not? 227 00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:44.060 Ivylevel: And I think, what else? In the aptitude bucket? 228 00:42:44.740 --> 00:43:11.459 Jenny Duan: That's mainly it in terms of aptitude. Letters of recommendation. That's also something down the line. I think it's really important to establish good relationship with your teachers and also sure that you're academically curious by asking questions in class, by, you know, working well in teams, by communicating well with your teacher. That's also really important. But other than that, there's not that much else for aptitude. Basically, just your test scores and your grades. 229 00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:18.009 Ivylevel: Okay? And what about those th, the awards and the scholarships that ",
    "you are applying to that doesn't fall under aptitude. 230 00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.729 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think those are more like 231 00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:35.899 Jenny Duan: impact passion for the most part, but I think, depending on what it is that could also qualify your aptitude. But again, those like major sides bear things. If you are not involved in that, since, like middle school or early high school. It's 232 00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.639 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's worth spending time to do that. 233 00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.010 Ivylevel: Yeah. 234 00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:50.480 Ivylevel: and and and that's something that again, it's very subject and curriculum driven right, like math or science, or something like that, right Olympiad as an example. 235 00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.660 Ivylevel: Where would the Decca Club? And things like that fall? 236 00:43:54.220 --> 00:44:15.129 Ivylevel: Extracurriculars. Well, those are extracurriculars. Yeah, I think it's a great area, right? Because you can. You can. You can literally like, okay, say, Hey, I did a stem research. I published a paper. Now, is that an aptitude, or is that an extra? It's mostly extra curricular, like all that is majority, is extracurricular. They feed into each other. 237 00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:31.310 Ivylevel: They're connected like the web, as you really say, okay, cool. Okay. So that's pretty much it. Okay, now, let's focus on the second. Sorry I'm driving the conversation a bit more here, because I want to also learn and and reiterate a few things. Now let's talk about the extracurricular or the passion, as we call it? 238 00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:43.599 Ivylevel: And then the community and the service right? So passion like, let's let's focus on what are the things that hoda you know is working on. And and just if you could give me an update and you know that you could give me an update like, you know. 239 00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:50.120 Ivylevel: Where are we with that? And an",
    "d you know, how will, how will that really contribute and impact 240 00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.749 Ivylevel: in terms? I mean, again, you can play the dual role of an admission officer. 241 00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:03.400 Ivylevel: you know. So just just simulate that thing for me. If Buda can do XYZ, that really boost her chances to do it, you know, get into like these kind of schools. 242 00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:08.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think that right now, what who does doing is already quite a lot. I think it's. 243 00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:33.479 Jenny Duan: I think, right now what I'm seeing as her main, like 3 types of activities are. First of all like being a developer freelance, developing, working on her video game, doing, empowering AI, doing her Youtube channel. I think that that lens of like being a being a developer, especially a female developer, is really impactful and important. I think that that's awesome. I also think that her passion for filmmaking. 244 00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:42.529 Jenny Duan: especially with folklift and her Youtube channel, and like film club at school, that's also really impactful. 245 00:45:42.530 --> 00:46:04.729 Jenny Duan: and so right now, I think that those are like the 2 main, like types of activities that I see Huda really involved in. I think that within those 2 types of activities there's still a really good mix of leadership, of extracurricular service. And so I think that that's all good. Who does anything we want to add in regards to like extracurriculars. 246 00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:28.270 huda: I guess. Maybe like my filmmakers club to like highlight my passion for filmmaking. And like media arts. I think one thing that kind of took initiative in is we're making the short film right now, and we've already published one before. But we're I'm gonna try to publicize it a bit more. But 247 00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:55.020 huda: besides that, like, I think we're making a pretty full fledged short film this this year, a",
    "nd I did all the script writing for this one because there was there wasn't that much club involvement. But like besides that, I think that this one's gonna be pretty grand. And we're planning on doing like like a movie night where we premiere it basically. And we're trying to have it school wide. To have like a greater impact. And like more people attending. 248 00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:18.969 Jenny Duan: Yeah? And then I think right now, what I'm seeing is the most necessary is, I think you have a good foundation. I don't think it's really necessary to like start a lot of new organizations now, but I think what is most impactful would be to like, expand your impact within these organizations or within these projects that you're doing. Another thing that I think is 249 00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:29.090 Jenny Duan: could be impactful is just expanding your I guess, like cultural identity and being more like connected to that, because I think that that really drives a lot of 250 00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:55.879 Jenny Duan: that drives like a lot of motivation, even with affirmative action. I think that it's really important to emphasize your culture. Specifically, I know, for my roommate. This is something that she emphasized a lot. She did a lot of Asian American advocacy in Chicago that was like her main spike, and she connected that to like her passion for public health, and why she wants to become a doctor because she's pre-med. But I think for you, obviously that connection is going to look a little bit different. But I think it's 251 00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:01.559 Jenny Duan: still really important, like, especially within technology and within video game development, to have like 252 00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:11.890 Jenny Duan: diversity in characters and video games in developing in software engineering. And like, you can really use your background as something to help you. So I think that that's like. 253 00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:23.690 Jenny Duan: so an opportunity for yo",
    "u to add a little bit more depth to your application. Because that's the thing with, you know, a lot of applicants is that on paper, a lot of people might look really similar, like, there's a lot of people who 254 00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:46.089 Jenny Duan: are involved in coding. Okay, there's a lot of people who maybe like video games that doesn't really make you different. But what makes you different is the intersection of all these things, and how your identity and your background really motivate you to pursue these things like no one else? Is you? So what are? What are the things about you that make you you like. Those are the things that you should bring out in your application, so they can distinguish you from other people. 255 00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.950 Jenny Duan: So I think that right now, like. 256 00:48:48.990 --> 00:49:13.249 Jenny Duan: I am really happy with your progress so far, I think that what's just most important is expanding the impact. So getting the word out to other people, because to be honest like for years is not really a lot of time to do stuff. And unfortunately, I think it is almost more important to like, tell other people that you're doing things rather than actually doing the things that make sense like. It's more important to have your impact 257 00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:43.030 Jenny Duan: really shown to other people and demonstrated then to like, even make the impact itself like, if that makes sense, I think you need to have some more like proof of work. Like, how many people have you impacted? How? What have you done like Xyc, and like, how are you working on developing that more? Because, remember, colleges are not investing in your work, they're investing in your potential. So they don't actually really care how much you've done? Or do they want to see like at their institution. What will you do 258 00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.299 Jenny Duan: in the future? 259 00:49:44.300 --> 00:50:06.800 Jenny Duan: And so how does your inter",
    "est in your background, and what you're doing right now? Inform your decision making for the future. So they don't actually care if you're like a coder, or if you're an artist, or if you're a musician or anything else. All they want to see is that you have a passion. And you're gonna like, eventually do something bigger with this passion. So they wanna see like, why you're interested in and how you hope to expand that over time. 260 00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:12.829 huda: Amazing, amazing! II think this is so enlightening. And II think 261 00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:20.429 Ivylevel: you know. And and this has been. This is really fundamentally the the kind of mystification of 262 00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:29.530 Ivylevel: this whole college pro process, right? Because it is such a such a ambiguous area. Right? Like you can. Literally, you can frame it the way you like it. 263 00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:38.859 Ivylevel: And it's not a standardized space. And I think that's what we are also trying to do. Because if you, I think students don't even know like what they are aiming for right like. And 264 00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:51.779 Ivylevel: you mentioned spike. And I've heard this multiple times, right? Like, because I think different mentors have absolutely different kind of play books. Right? So, Janice, her playbook is very simple right. She comes in to any call, and she would just say. 265 00:50:51.820 --> 00:51:00.189 Ivylevel: there are 2 paths, and you know this is like 3 years 4 years old, like kind of thing, you know. She's already like, you know, on on her way out, like now to to the the workforce. 266 00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:06.949 Ivylevel: So she would like, you know, either spike or broad, right? And you know, maybe is like even like 2. So, for example. 267 00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:19.669 Ivylevel: what I so I think this is how I would love to frame this right so that Huda understands. So what do you and I'm I'm just kind of internalizing it and trying to capture it in in",
    " some framework. 268 00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.270 Ivylevel: That's kind of our dashboard as well that I'm building. 269 00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:32.499 Ivylevel: So what you just mentioned like Number one, this academics or aptitude, whatever you call it like in academics. Partly. Next thing is really these extra curriculums right, which is really passion at the end of the day. 270 00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.770 Ivylevel: I think 271 00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:54.830 Ivylevel: 2 things right one is really a mean, and the other thing is the outcome and the goal that you're it's really to demonstrate your passion. What? What is the goal. What is the objective of what you're doing? I think all these extracurriculars and this passion projects, and all these are just means to demonstrate that you are really passionate about something 272 00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:57.410 Ivylevel: and with depth, and that spike. 273 00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:13.740 Ivylevel: and that when you come to this particular school you will be able to really make a big impact, right as an alumni, or you know, as as as a college student, you know of this particular school. So I think that's what you're demonstrating, and the way the admission officers again internalizing 274 00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:18.920 Ivylevel: the way the admission officers evaluate that in whatever one or 2 min they get 275 00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.080 Ivylevel: is through the lens of the impact you have done. Is that correct? 276 00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:45.600 Ivylevel: It's it's not to really know who the other see? At the end of the day of the like all the great work, and she's been showing me amazing work, like she's such a great developer. I even told her that, you know. Maybe you don't even have to go to school right? Like, just go in and maybe should just get a job right? She can be a great game developer like she's amazing in development. Like II can vouch for that. But she's like, No, I wanna go to school. So 277 00:52:45.940 -->",
    " 00:52:49.169 Ivylevel: what they're gonna look at it is not your game, what you've done? 278 00:52:49.260 --> 00:53:01.069 Ivylevel: They're like, okay. What impact did you make like, for example, Maddie? As an example. she had a Minecraft server. She generated $60,000 revenue in her middle school. 279 00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.639 Ivylevel: right? And her story was her mom actually 280 00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:14.620 Ivylevel: a tiger? Mom did not like her playing game, and she basically just threw off her laptop or or computer. And this is a publicly available interview. And I'll show a very inspiring story. 281 00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:37.679 Ivylevel: And and she basically said, You know what like, I'm gonna make my own money right? A bit rebellious. But she constructively used it. And that's what got her into mit launch X video. I saw that video as well, and she got another program as well. She got accepted into 2 just because of that kind of narrative and that story that she built. So it's one kind of that impact that Huda has to show something that that will be a good spike for her 282 00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:46.290 Ivylevel: number one, and then also, like what are the 3? If I were to put like 3 attributes right? One is your 283 00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:52.270 Ivylevel: passion in your subject, your stem correct? Because you're saying that she's a developer. That's number one. 284 00:53:52.500 --> 00:54:03.629 Ivylevel: Then you're telling that it's not enough to be a developer, because there are too many developers out there like. There is nothing special about it. That's why don't just blindly run towards AI time a dozen. 285 00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.229 Ivylevel: But you're also 286 00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:10.580 Jenny Duan: a videographer. That's your creative side. Your humanity's side of it. 287 00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:20.040 Ivylevel: Then you are trying it together, right and plus your, then you need to bring in the impact. So stem humanity's impact 288 00:",
    "54:20.110 --> 00:54:24.749 Ivylevel: the community service impact right? And and the impact is really the community impact correct 289 00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:52.050 Jenny Duan: yeah impact can be through various forms. So for example, if you're a science researcher. You publish your paper. That's a big impact, too. Impact is dependent on what you want to do. But for who to like? If she's able to reach a lot of people with her video game. That's a big impact. If she's able to, you know, inspire a lot of people to support these small businesses. That's big impact, too. It's dependent on. You know what a person does. Okay, it doesn't necessarily have to be a community impact. Is that correct? 290 00:54:52.050 --> 00:55:01.889 Jenny Duan: It's best if it translates into community, like, for example, with the science thing like, how does what you've learned impact the community? But I mean. 291 00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:20.930 huda: so I I'm in the process of like trying to get other people in like involved with folklift. So I'm like trying to expand it to like other communities beyond the Bay Area, and, like, you know, getting them to write their own articles about their own minority groups. 292 00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:41.429 huda: so that cause like impact, like having like have having impacted like multiple regions with like more people involved or is like, is the act of having like, for example, like if I were to put I produce like 50 articles. As comparison to like. I've contacted like 293 00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:53.279 huda: 5 people throughout the nation. And they've written it around written about their own minorities like which one do you think like would be a better way to Port Portray like folklift? 294 00:55:53.310 --> 00:56:08.510 Jenny Duan: You could say you've built this platform now with over 250 articles. That's what you would say. like you built. This doesn't matter if other people contributed to it. There's now 250 articles on it. If 5 people each right 50",
    ", I mean, that's how you present it. Yeah. 295 00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:19.290 Ivylevel: So, Huda, you are in a scale-up mode here, and I think one very important point that Jenny mentioned that this particular, like the at this point in time, Huda. and also great learning for me. 296 00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:39.650 Ivylevel: It's all about scaling and impacting your focus. Your energy should be on that. I think whatever you've developed are your assets. Now you need to see how you can really showcase them and how you can bring that out. And I think that's not a not. That's not an easy thing, Jenny, and I'm I'm kind of talking this like as as on the Pm. Front. I think a great value that we can add here, because. 297 00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:52.669 Ivylevel: you know, that's where kids struggle like, you know, Huda has got these assets. She like, for example, like she has been there, you know, really like struggling to get these middle schoolers for a free kind of AI thing. 298 00:56:52.730 --> 00:57:08.210 Ivylevel: because she's not very exposed to like social media scaling of channel. She's doing it for the first time, and I think this is where we can really help and guide her. I mean to a point that I've actually spoken of the record, and maybe we can delete this. I've spoken to many Stanford students, you know, right? 299 00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:17.979 Ivylevel: And I've heard some weird, weird stories right like on how these things work. And you know, especially with international students coming from abroad like, you know, that. You know, things are like. 300 00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:33.459 Ivylevel: you know, I don't wanna call it out. But yeah, so it's like having a pr agency, you know, having like a videographers like, you know, they literally they they, you know, they spend money to to make this thing like, you know, have your Pr out there. Things like that. This happens 301 00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:38.899 Ivylevel: right? It's a gamified system at the end of the day",
    ". So I think that's something 302 00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:43.679 Ivylevel: is is a good value. Add right? That we can really position. 303 00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:51.800 Ivylevel: It's not so much about what extracurricular to do. I think it's also about scaling and showing that impact where the the beauty is. Right? 304 00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:54.720 Definitely. 305 00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:55.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 306 00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:06.399 Ivylevel: okay, great. I know that there's one last minute. But this was important. I think, then, eventually, I think the third bucket is is really having that that narrative that you want to tell. And I think. 307 00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:16.979 Ivylevel: And this is where you brought this. II didn't really know where to fit the identity, because identity to me, like, you know, it's really an underlying layer. Right? You have to deeply personalize it at every point. 308 00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:26.860 Ivylevel: right? And I think, whether it be your Cs projects, or whether it be your videography, I think the more you bring your cultural identity and your identity and personalize it, it's it's always good. 309 00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:51.809 Jenny Duan: Is it fair to say that it's more like an underlying layer that cuts across everything. Yeah, I would agree. And so right now, like what I'm trying to do, for Huda is giving her more opportunities to platform her work. I think that's the main thing, like platforming your work and getting recognition for what you're doing, because, you know, I feel like you're very humble like you don't really like to take ownership or recognition for your work, but it's really important, too, because you're so skilled. 310 00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:52.740 Like. 311 00:58:52.780 --> 00:59:15.080 Jenny Duan: honestly, most of the people who make it are not the people who are the smartest. They're really not not the people who work the hardest people who can do the best at presenting themselves. And that'",
    "s like a really hard truth, because we want to see like the smartest and most talented people succeed. That's not often the case, because it's often times and people who can express their work the best you can communicate it with other people. Those are the people who 312 00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:42.730 Jenny Duan: gain the recognition. And so that's not necessarily right. But that's the way that the world is. So right now, what we're working together on is the reason why, we're applying for things like the Nc. With sc. Like women and computing aspirations and computing award or bank of America. Student leaders or Notre Dame leadership seminars is to give you a platform and to add credibility because you've already done the work. Now, you just need someone to recognize that you've done the work. 313 00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:46.020 huda: Does that matter? Does that make sense like? Ultimately 314 00:59:46.310 --> 01:00:09.379 Jenny Duan: the value in your work comes from yourself? But you also need other people to see it into like, recognize that. So you can add more credibility to you. Because if you say like, okay, I'm like a really good game developer, everyone's gonna be like cool. But if 10 other people will say that okay, who? That? You're a really good game developer, then that like, adds another layer of credibility. 315 01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:30.830 Jenny Duan: But I think. Be careful with this, because you don't want to be chasing other people's validation, for your whole life like this is, that's not the goal here, but the goal here is just to have other people recognize your work so you can get a platform and like, demonstrate that on your application. It's a game plan. It's a gamified system. Let's be honest, right? I mean, you're a gamer. You're developing games. So that right? How can you not know this like you have to play by the rules. Right? 316 01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:44.960 Ivylevel: So I'm glad that I think lot of these things are coming across. I kno",
    "w we are running out of the hour. But let me just wrap this up. In fact, what you're just telling me is. And and and just last thing is, where does this go Jenni. 317 01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:57.389 Ivylevel: Eventually, the way this manifests in the 2 min that these application officers are actually reviewing your application like, it's just the funny part, right all these 4 years. And all this hard work, you know, eventually comes down to this thing 318 01:00:57.430 --> 01:01:09.559 Ivylevel: and they'll. I think one thing is your essay critically important. That's why everyone wants to spend money and narrative. That's a narrative and narrative, and that's personality of who you are. It doesn't have to do anything with your 319 01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:17.770 Ivylevel: academics or anything else. But then the other things is where the activity list, right? Where do they see this proof of work? 320 01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:19.480 Ivylevel: Here's my question to you. 321 01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.920 Ivylevel: where do they see the proof of work? How do they do the do they Google search you like, how do they verify it? 322 01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:44.150 Jenny Duan: They don't have time. They just look at what you write about yourself. That's what I'm like. It's kind of big, because, honestly, people like rely on their application all the time, like the most common lies. People have an Instagram account, and they call a nonprofit. That's like, so everyone does that. That's like a big lie like there's lots of 323 01:01:44.350 --> 01:02:02.920 Jenny Duan: they. They can't know the only way they can note letters and recommendations. That's why they really care. Letters. Recommendations are honestly, very, very undervalued. Those are really important, and people don't pay enough attention to their relationship with their teachers, because that's one of the best ways they can get validation about what kind of student you are. They reach your letters, recommendation. They look a",
    "t your activities. 324 01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:18.019 Jenny Duan: your activities, they only looking for like the type of activities that you do. If you hold leadership positions, what kind of impact you've made bullet points. I have 100 people in my club, or I raise $30,000, or I built 5 325 01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:48.119 Jenny Duan: XYZ. You know they're looking for the concrete number numbers, and then awards. The awards are is another very valuable thing because awards you apply, and someone else has already judged you at that point. So, for example, if you win coca Cola scholarship, that organization, a very reputable organization has already judged you. And so the colleges, because they trust that organization they can trust that organization is judging you. So that's why awards are so important because it's like another layer of validation that, like you are a good student. Because. 326 01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:56.080 Jenny Duan: if someone else thinks that you're a good student, then the college is, gonna think that you are a good zoom because they trust that middle party. Does that make sense? 327 01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.290 Yeah. 328 01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:24.809 huda: I wanted to update you like, I know we're running short on time. But so I've kind of tried to been be like more frequent on my social media account. Yeah, I posted like a few reels, and a few of them are actually like, doing pretty good. And apparently like, okay, I don't know if this is that grand? But it says I've reached like a a thousand like non followers. 329 01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:33.940 huda: And it's kind of like a big step. And I think also, for for once, like, my content is kind of going out towards like 330 01:03:33.940 --> 01:04:01.099 huda: other game developers as well cause my other videos. Usually they just kind of like target, like people that I know or like just random people. But for the first time, I think, like, my content is actually going out to people that I want my co",
    "ntent to go out to. So like, that's kind of something that I've been happy about this week. 331 01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:16.129 Jenny Duan: I think, is very inspiring and also motivating, because, like, if you don't have other game developers in your life, you don't really know, like what the game developing community is thinking about what kinds of opportunities are out there. But once you start connecting with other game developers, they can kind of direct you in the 332 01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:21.099 Jenny Duan: direction that you need to be. You know, in terms of 333 01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:33.519 Jenny Duan: different opportunities to publish your games, you know potential users things like that 334 01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:40.439 Ivylevel: probably like knows that a lot of things that I say, too, but it's good to hear this validation coming from you and 335 01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.530 Ivylevel: helping us align as well. Great, I think. 336 01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:53.310 Ivylevel: yeah. So let's continue on this. I think you have your game plan. I think what I'm gonna do is also like, you know, craft. 337 01:04:53.380 --> 01:05:16.990 Ivylevel: What you've just done is actually you're again highlighted. A few things are critically important, very outcome, driven like letter of recommendation. Strategy. Right? Your Ap. Strategy your you know proof of work like, you know, everyone keeps talking about extracurricular passion project. Blah, blah, blah blah blah! You know Julie came, and all that stuff. No one talks about this important thing which really matters at the end of the day. Right? 338 01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.680 Ivylevel: So I think 339 01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:23.310 Ivylevel: this is how we we can really like help these students. So 340 01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:44.800 Jenny Duan: it's not. It's not bad who the see, like, you know, who does literally like, you know, she was yesterday, like, you know, yeah, II just can't like get into these schools anymore, lik",
    "e I'm done. It's never over and like you should never be the person to tell yourself, no, never tell yourself. No. If they if an admissions officer wants to tell you no that's up to them, but shouldn't be up to you. 341 01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:52.730 huda: So like, okay, so I know. I know it's like it's still possible. But like. 342 01:05:52.950 --> 01:06:11.079 huda: if compared to Stanford, like, would Usc, be more like accepting of people with bees or like do you think it's like just the same like, kinda like, obviously like you said, it's possible if I keep trying. But like, I just wanna see like 343 01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:24.889 Ivylevel: is Usc, like more accepting to like, I sorry to interrupt. Yeah, I think we? Let's respect her time. I think it's already quite late. Even though I would love to show you the a glimpse of the site that we're going to launch tomorrow morning 1030. 344 01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:44.090 Ivylevel: But I think what I want to do is wanna have another session where? Let's go through college list. And Huda I want, you know again. Sorry. I've been a bit assertive, and you see, like this is the bad side of me as a dad Jenni, a bit more assertive here like I want you to take like what? The model of the story for me. Here, here is this Huda, right 345 01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.579 Ivylevel: like you shouldn't be like thinking and valuing yourself just through the lens of B. 346 01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:57.699 Ivylevel: You're not just a B right, that's word like Ja, that's the model of the story to me doesn't mean that you. You can live with B. You have to fix it. 347 01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:04.680 Ivylevel: But that is just one small data point. Think about it like you're you. You are so unique for the 348 01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.960 Ivylevel: and the other thing that Jenny has really highlighted. 349 01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:16.240 Ivylevel: I mean, this is a land of you know you fake it till you make it. Unfortunately, I mean, don't you know t",
    "he power of narratives with 350 01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:22.479 Ivylevel: Don't you know the power of narratives? That's what's happening today. Whoever's got the strongest narrative wins right 351 01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:39.080 Ivylevel: like. So you you have to build your like. And and I think you know th, this is a pro. And this is very unfair Jenny, because there are a lot of brilliant minds, and students, unfortunately, are unable to showcase their work, and especially more the analytical and stem folks like, you know, Cs, and 352 01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:51.009 Ivylevel: right amazing, like technical skills. But they are not able to showcase themselves because of the communication gap and stuff like that. So so ku kudos and thanks a lot for bringing that out. 353 01:07:51.610 --> 01:08:01.589 Ivylevel: yeah, I think next week, let's I think, college list Maddy. And I've been discussing every parent till the last moment. Everyone's just talking about college list. 354 01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:05.090 Ivylevel: I have been glued on to these Facebook groups. 355 01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:13.069 Ivylevel: and I can tell you that by the day EAED. December, Jan. College list, college list, college list number one. 356 01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:17.950 Ivylevel: It's all about college list. It's never over. So I think. 357 01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:31.150 Ivylevel: I'm I'm you know. II can really now correlate with all the initial micro services that you had actually built. Right? It's it's very clear that major. Those kind of things are very important. So let's focus on college list next session. 358 01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:38.250 Ivylevel: And find, you know, a good session, so you know, she can still make it to Stanford. So you see, like, although it's not over for you, so 359 01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:44.910 Ivylevel: don't. Yeah. But I think more important, I would say, is like your narrative should be very clear, and you need to work backwards 360 01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:58.609 Ivyle",
    "vel: right? I think ideally. You know what I'm thinking is, Jenny. We, the the part of our game plan is to give them a future. You right? What is your profile? What is your narrative that you're giving? Right? This is this is, go and stick it on your wall. 361 01:08:58.649 --> 01:09:06.580 Ivylevel: And now you're working backwards. You need to work on it. Work on it to achieve that profile, to make it to these dream schools. That's what it is. 362 01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:08.450 Ivylevel: Your narrative. 363 01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.970 huda: So yeah. 364 01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:33.350 Jenny Duan: cool. Well, yeah, thanks again. We'll schedule another session and break through it soon. But what I wanted to just give you the take away is like it's always upwards. Trajectory in your mindset is the most thing that matters like a push that's in your control. If you can control it, you can do it. You can't change the past. But you can change the future, you know. 365 01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.380 Jenny Duan: Anyways. 366 01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:37.510 Jenny Duan: talk to you soon. Thanks again. 367 01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:47.200 Ivylevel: Yeah, I don't hold you. I think I'll send it to you tomorrow, because already quite late. That's fine. We'll spend time. But you've actually, I've learned a lot, and it's gonna be very helpful. 368 01:09:47.229 --> 01:10:09.869 Ivylevel: and Huta. You can do it. I think you have to do Sat, and then you have to nail it. So thanks a lot Jenny. Talk to you on Sunday. I'll set up some time. Sorry I've been late on a few things on your Pm. On your mentoring. I've been like pretty on time and all that stuff. So I really I really appreciate you being patient because I've been really like heads down, you know, and and hopefully you'll like it, and and we'll make some. 369 01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:12.850 Ivylevel: I think we are launching basically 3 services, Jenny. 370 01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:17.470 Ivylevel: One is now that we have this 6 weeks. Yo",
    "u see, 2 weeks. 371 01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:27.580 Ivylevel: We want to do an application boost. We want to do an essay, elevate 500 $500 session, and we want to do, you know, and prep, you know, iv level prep, and all that. So you'll see. 372 01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:34.559 Ivylevel: I think it's it's good time for us, because peak of the moment till common app, Jan. First deadline. So 373 01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:37.369 Ivylevel: I think whatever you just said, it's amazing. 374 01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:41.180 Jenny Duan: Oh, take care, bye, bye."
