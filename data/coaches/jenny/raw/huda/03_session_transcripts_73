Did you change it? It looks different. 6 00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.650 huda: Oh, thank you. Yeah. I changed my parting so. 7 00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.760 Jenny Duan: Okay, is my microphone. Okay? Or sorry. 8 00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.960 Jenny Duan: Switched it. 2 things. 9 00:01:02.684 --> 00:01:07.300 huda: It's a little like I I'm having difficulties hearing you, but. 10 00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.449 Jenny Duan: Is this better or worse? 11 00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.770 huda: I think this is better. Yeah. 12 00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.679 Jenny Duan: Let's just do that for now let me know if it's like too distracting areas. If you can hear me, then that's okay. 13 00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:35.250 Jenny Duan: Alright. So. Do you want to start with your would you like to start with reviewing your standard short answers? Or would you like to go back to your comment? 14 00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:41.599 huda: I guess I'll just give a quick kind of like update on the Stanford essays. 15 00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:48.699 huda: So I showed my dad all the essays, and he really liked the last one. About like 16 00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:57.580 huda: like contribution essay. That one he thought that, like the roommate essay it could be tweaked a little cause. 17 00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:16.380 huda: I think, he said, that like the night owl thing is a bit cliche, and that he's seen it in like a lot of essays, and that and that like, maybe the rabbit holding part like, I think he just didn't really quite understand or like he doesn't. He didn't really like the term. I'm not sure why, but 18 00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:21.879 huda: yeah. And then for the 1st essay, which is about like the curiosity essay 19 00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:34.010 huda: he liked parts of it so like the part where it talks about what like, where I was wondering, like the statistical journey of the rice in my mother's palau and then like 20 00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:43.179 huda: that he liked that part, and he just felt like it could be more personalized and like some like this part. Where, I say. 21 00:02:43.440 --> 00:03:00.039 huda: how can our DNA reshape the narrative? Our migration? He said. That was fine. And then the why do people people's favorite colors shift over time. Can social media predict predict culture trends? He said. He just like thought it sounded like, I was just putting a few questions there. 22 00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:05.780 huda: And it didn't really relate to me or anything. But yeah, I was like wondering what you think. 23 00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that 24 00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.799 Jenny Duan: that makes sense. I think that social media predicting cultural trends isn't that irrelevant? 25 00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.426 Jenny Duan: Isn't that the line that we added, based on? Or was that something different? 26 00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.850 huda: That was the computer science, education and financial disparity. 27 00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:45.840 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I I see what he. Okay, I see that point there. So let's just go back and edit that. So I say, 3 dots finalized. Would you say like your dad? Or does he have any questions about that one? 28 00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.379 huda: I think he like he liked that one, so he didn't really have anything. 29 00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.949 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's go back to the 1st and say, I do agree that yeah. 30 00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:04.250 Jenny Duan: that some parts of this could be made more personalized. But I also think that it is good as it is. But if we want to make it more personalized, maybe 31 00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.760 Jenny Duan: let's look. Let's start here. So a separate deep dive into data visualization. Is there a way that you could make that connect to something about you? 32 00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.440 huda: Like, maybe 33 00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:33.579 huda: maybe like, instead of like a subreddit deep dive into data visualization, I can took a deep dive into 34 00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.280 huda: like. 35 00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:52.929 huda: I don't know. This is not really in my profile, but it could be something like like one of the different things about me, like, for example, a subreddit deep dive on like music ranking, or something like that. Cause that that because it's also like data. 36 00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:00.200 huda: It's also I also really like listening to music. But like, yeah, I actually don't know if that really relates to my profile. 37 00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.000 huda: yeah. 38 00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.659 Jenny Duan: What's like one of your favorite music artists. 39 00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:11.389 huda: Maybe Billy Joel. 40 00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:29.469 Jenny Duan: Maybe. The spotify data visualization on Billy Joel pop up pop tracks 41 00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.462 Jenny Duan: something like that. 42 00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:37.205 Jenny Duan: What do you think. 43 00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.670 huda: Yeah, I like that. 44 00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.188 Jenny Duan: Alright. Well, another tax! 45 00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.190 Jenny Duan: How does this relate? I feel like you already. Talk about. 46 00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.490 huda: Like. 47 00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.510 Jenny Duan: Migration here, so we don't need to talk about. 48 00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.620 huda: Yeah, I think something different. 49 00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.159 huda: So possibly 50 00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.200 huda: maybe like, even like the Ap score distribution. 51 00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.189 huda: I don't know if that relates 52 00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.019 Jenny Duan: How would that relate. 53 00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.750 huda: Cause. It's like. 54 00:06:20.218 --> 00:06:36.930 huda: kind of like an academic part like, because that is like data. It's like, for example, like 25% people got like this, many people. But I guess, like, I don't know if it shows my curiosity enough, because I feel like everyone looks at that. 55 00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.100 huda: So maybe something. 56 00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.200 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if that adds anything additional to your 57 00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.970 Jenny Duan: is there something else you feel like? You can highlight here. 58 00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.850 huda: Maybe like the like. 59 00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.569 huda: like an e-sports like 60 00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.990 huda: like 61 00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.069 huda: ranking, or or kind of like 62 00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.410 huda: like a visualization, or like a dashboard to show like 63 00:07:14.838 --> 00:07:17.789 huda: like the results of like a esports competition. 64 00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:35.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes another tracks point for the latest. What's- what's the new sports game that you watch. 65 00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.900 huda: Like the. 66 00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.899 Jenny Duan: It's like I don't know. 67 00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.260 huda: Fortnight. 68 00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.589 Jenny Duan: Can you write that in? 69 00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.410 Jenny Duan: How's that. 70 00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.690 huda: Yeah, I like that. 71 00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.580 Jenny Duan: Okay. Now, let's pass through these 2 questions. 72 00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:28.760 Jenny Duan: What are other questions that are relevant to things that you do? Maybe for like journalism, you could talk about. You could connect one of these questions to like a journalism topic that you've studied or reported on. 73 00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:38.080 huda: Or like, maybe like, even in like, broader, like circumstances like, what percent of communities aren't like reported on 74 00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.950 huda: something like that. But I. 75 00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.829 Jenny Duan: It's really good. 76 00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:45.039 huda: Yeah, I don't. I don't know if that like tells anything about data. But 77 00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:47.139 huda: I I think it is actually. 78 00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:53.460 Jenny Duan: I think it does. Because I think in these questions you want to illustrate, maybe things that you might want to answer while you're at Stanford 79 00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.650 Jenny Duan: so like, what questions would you be interested in exploring, like 3 classes or other languages? 80 00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.590 huda: And. 81 00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:27.779 Jenny Duan: Maybe something like that. And then you could talk about like, what stories 82 00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.050 Jenny Duan: make sure you proceed. But yeah. 83 00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.140 huda: Wait. Sorry! What was that? 84 00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.440 Jenny Duan: How do you feel about this census question? 85 00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.789 huda: I I think 86 00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.900 huda: it might not make sense in like the journalism context, 87 00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.310 huda: so like, maybe what percent of communities 88 00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.050 huda: like maybe 89 00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.040 huda: don't have media outlets 90 00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.719 huda: or aren't represented in media. 91 00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.530 Jenny Duan: Feels broad. 92 00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.970 huda: Hmm! 93 00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.760 huda: Wait! What was wrong with the haven't been reported on. Send question. 94 00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:44.379 Jenny Duan: It's really broad. What does it mean to be reported on? What it's just? I know I'm unclear, what that question entails and like, how you would go about solving those questions. 95 00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:53.709 huda: Oh, yeah, I was. I meant like like, like, which communities like haven't been like like. 96 00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:00.925 huda: I guess, written about like broadcasted on like news channels 97 00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.241 huda: like represented in media, I guess, in general, but. 98 00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:16.810 Jenny Duan: That an important problem, because not all representation is given. Maybe some communities that don't need to be reported on, because there's just. 99 00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:26.319 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like, I feel like there's that's not clear. Why, that is an issue, or what how data directly contributes to solving it. Right? 100 00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.880 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 101 00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.079 huda: Then we could change this question and do something else. I'm not sure how to. 102 00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:49.699 Jenny Duan: I feel like journalism is a good lens to take this through. But I just think we need to find like a narrow question or a more targeted question about how having access to more data would solve for relating data to journalism. 103 00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:03.659 huda: Maybe this could like touch back on like the misinformation aspect. So it could be like 104 00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.660 huda: like 105 00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.330 huda: what 106 00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.420 huda: like 107 00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:25.799 huda: like, how are like our statements considered true or like, I don't know how to word it, but like talk about like misinformation, and like how like cause data can solve that by like providing like 108 00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.000 huda: proof. 109 00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.780 huda: I guess but I don't know how to word it. 110 00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:42.240 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like we should leave the misinformation for the one that say about this information, because I think, like it might be redundant to repeat it in such an errors like 111 00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.940 Jenny Duan: boundary of of writing? 112 00:12:45.855 --> 00:12:55.050 Jenny Duan: Is there another question that you want to answer? Like, maybe, like one of the Stanford classes that you want to take like what's 1 issue that you want to explore or see the answer to. 113 00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.970 huda: I'm not really sure how to connect it to journalism without like 114 00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.170 huda: cause. 115 00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:18.640 huda: cause, like like the topic of the essay, is talking about like, how like the question, like. 116 00:13:19.538 --> 00:13:23.239 huda: data can answer a question. And then. 117 00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:26.639 huda: I'm not sure how to connect that to journalism. 118 00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.600 Jenny Duan: Wait. What is the connection between data and journalism? 119 00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:42.559 huda: I mean, like data is part of journalism, because it provides these facts. And I guess, like 120 00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.539 huda: backs up whatever is brought up in journalism. 121 00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, so why is data necessary for doing. 122 00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.969 huda: So that you can differentiate like 123 00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.460 huda: just hearsay and 124 00:13:57.225 --> 00:13:57.980 huda: fact 125 00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.920 huda: misinformation. But yeah. 126 00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:10.319 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what's another way, data can be used to substantiate journalism. 127 00:14:12.338 --> 00:14:13.649 huda: Maybe you can like 128 00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:25.450 huda: show, like severity of something, because people are usually more like likely to consider something serious if they see like large numbers or like data. 129 00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe. How can we assess the severity of 130 00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.310 Jenny Duan: oh, it seems like. 131 00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.550 Jenny Duan: okay. 132 00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:56.290 Jenny Duan: you can say through, you can say without, wait what you said. 133 00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.580 huda: Shakespeed. 134 00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:15.970 Jenny Duan: Up to you. Whatever you think is important, maybe like for me, I would write like, how can we assess this? If this were my essay I would write, how can we assess the severity of the teenage mental health crisis through through access to social media data like something like that. 135 00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:25.499 Jenny Duan: or, like another person, might say, How do we assess the severity of the climate crisis through California wildfire disaster? 136 00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.919 Jenny Duan: Something like that. 137 00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.140 huda: Okay? And then 138 00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.150 huda: severity of 139 00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.229 huda: maybe like AI bias. 140 00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.080 huda: maybe like, should I say, like individual stories. 141 00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.869 Jenny Duan: How does that relate to data. 142 00:16:07.471 --> 00:16:09.440 huda: Cause. That is like a data point. 143 00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.850 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 144 00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:27.450 Jenny Duan: what would be an example of an individual story you would look at to identify the severity. 145 00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:42.404 huda: Like, for example, like this platform where you can like, talk about your experience with like AI bias. And then there can. There's like multiple people that submit like pieces about like, for example, 146 00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:49.060 huda: they're like, there's like an AI test proctoring service which might like negatively harm like people of color. 147 00:16:49.518 --> 00:16:58.830 huda: And then, like these, different instances are like data points to like help, like highlight, the severity of AI ethics. In daily life. 148 00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.140 Jenny Duan: Great idea. 149 00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.770 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's think about one more question. 150 00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.049 Jenny Duan: Or do you think you need another question here? 151 00:17:08.585 --> 00:17:12.019 huda: I think it would be good if I could think of one more question. 152 00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:19.199 Jenny Duan: What's something else that you're curious about, or that you spend time thinking about in regards to. 153 00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.730 huda: Maybe like. 154 00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.050 huda: how like. 155 00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.379 huda: how does like a like a 156 00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.450 huda: child's education? 157 00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.589 huda: How does like childhood education lead to. 158 00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:47.800 huda: I guess, like happiness in the future like something, not happiness. It could be something like. 159 00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:54.149 huda: I feel like if I say income that's like, really basic. Because, like a lot of people will assume like, Oh, people with 160 00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:55.830 huda: like 161 00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.199 huda: higher education levels will have like a higher income. So I'm gonna do something that's like, really like 162 00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:07.550 huda: like the 2 things that don't really have a correlation. But like you that you see that there's a relationship 163 00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.290 huda: so like 164 00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.569 huda: cause I want to bring in like education somehow. So 165 00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.272 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe, like, how does a student 166 00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.219 Jenny Duan: early childhood education correspond to? 167 00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.890 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Future 168 00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.150 Jenny Duan: future outcomes. Maybe that's broad. But maybe we could just leave it at that. 169 00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.120 Jenny Duan: Excuse me. 170 00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:11.869 huda: And then I think this paragraph's fine. I think this question might actually, if I can't think of anything else, I could just put this like early childhood education part over here. 171 00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:15.369 huda: The disease outbreaks via Google search. 172 00:19:15.843 --> 00:19:19.290 huda: I think that one I definitely need to replace. 173 00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Maybe something else. More. Specific. 174 00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.450 Jenny Duan: Good. 175 00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.430 huda: From. 176 00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:38.220 huda: I don't know if I want to repeat like music again. But like predicting like 177 00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.862 huda: oh, I guess I guess I don't really wanna repeat that again. So 178 00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.710 huda: predicting 179 00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.150 huda: maybe like predicting the next 180 00:20:06.671 --> 00:20:10.910 huda: biggest podcast through Google searches or something like that. 181 00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.959 Jenny Duan: Is that something that you've done? 182 00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.669 Jenny Duan: Everything is all 3, but. 183 00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:26.999 huda: I mean, yeah, I mean, like, I can see, like 184 00:20:27.764 --> 00:20:30.140 huda: based off of like 185 00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:37.269 huda: trends and like like the way social media is like what they talk about. And then seeing like different podcasts. 186 00:20:37.724 --> 00:20:45.580 huda: and seeing, like their topics, that they discuss like predicting like, oh, this one will probably get popular because it's talking about like this topic. 187 00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:54.099 Jenny Duan: That sounds good. I just changed it to via Google. Search trends because I know that that's publicly accessible. 188 00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.089 Jenny Duan: Don't take a moment, sir. 189 00:21:08.174 --> 00:21:13.520 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay. But how do you feel about this? 190 00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.759 huda: I feel like it's a lot better now. Yeah. 191 00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.850 Jenny Duan: We were 10 words over. So I think we need to cut 10 words. 192 00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.699 huda: I think I could. 193 00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.469 huda: I feel like this sent. This question could be removed. I don't know if it's too like. 194 00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.960 huda: is it? 195 00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.120 Jenny Duan: It's done, we'll be just. 196 00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.340 Jenny Duan: Oh. 197 00:21:44.773 --> 00:21:48.106 Jenny Duan: that's exactly 2 pictures. 198 00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.050 huda: That's too late. 199 00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. Okay, let's go to the future review. 200 00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.835 Jenny Duan: So. 201 00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.960 Jenny Duan: my God. 202 00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:08.970 Jenny Duan: we want to redo this. If we want to get rid of this night, owl and rabbit holding analogies. 203 00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.579 Jenny Duan: Maybe we just start over and choose a new analogy. Or do you think this is salvageable, or like? What was your dad's feedback. 204 00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:20.700 huda: I mean, I personally think that 205 00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:29.030 huda: I personally think that it. I feel like it's still good. And I think that, like I'm effectively like showing different aspects of like 206 00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:37.549 huda: who I am through this essay. But I like I'm not sure like, if do you think that, like the night owl like, do you think that's like 207 00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:43.869 huda: done a lot, or it's like cliche cause? If so, then then I think I'm fine with like 208 00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.170 huda: like restarting this, because, like the whole premise of this is like doing stuff late at night. 209 00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:56.279 huda: But actually, no, I think this is salvageable, because, like some of these things like I could even be doing like during the day, or something like that. 210 00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:06.060 Jenny Duan: Okay, so how do you want to? I guess. Reformat this with the different framing, or what are your thoughts? Yeah. 211 00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.870 huda: So I'm I'm not really sure like what like analogy to like, replace it with 212 00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:21.420 huda: which is probably like the 1st step I should take. But 213 00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.519 huda: oh, yeah, also. My dad also said that I'm missing like the component where 214 00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:33.660 huda: I have to show like how I'll care for the roommate, like, for example, like a lot of essays, talk about like 215 00:23:34.089 --> 00:23:44.559 huda: them, for example, like bringing tea for them, or something like that, like how I'd interact with their roommates. So I think he said that was missing as well. So 216 00:23:44.977 --> 00:23:48.970 huda: that's also one thing to consider when I'm writing the new draft. But 217 00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.829 huda: hmm! I can't think of any analogies right now. But 218 00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:09.950 huda: maybe actually. What if I like? What if I did describe like my poster wall, and then, like each poster, could have like a significance 219 00:24:10.314 --> 00:24:18.590 huda: like, for example, like on my poster wall, I like hung like a receipt of like when we went to like a jazz cafe. 220 00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:36.619 huda: I think coho! And so and then that could be like I could discuss like that, and then I could also discuss like reading, and like that aspect. And then I could do like another, or like the Ada Lovelace thing is already a poster, so I don't really need to change that. And then I can have like a poster for 221 00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.170 huda: like, let me just. 222 00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.080 huda: I could have like a poster, for like a game that I play like, for example. 223 00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.860 huda: like. 224 00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.420 huda: maybe just like valorant, or something like that, like I could have a poster for that 225 00:24:55.914 --> 00:24:57.290 huda: and then, like each 226 00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.399 huda: like poster, would signify signify something. 227 00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:11.909 Jenny Duan: Wait. I feel like that might also feel a bit like I think that's probably also an overdone analogy. 228 00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:12.830 huda: Oh! 229 00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.020 Jenny Duan: Is there anything else you can think of. 230 00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.461 huda: Well, I can't think of any analogy, said 231 00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:29.490 Jenny Duan: Sorry. Not analogy. Just like, I guess, framing mechanism for this lesson doesn't have to be analogy. 232 00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:50.510 huda: I'm not sure like I'm not sure how to approach the the prompt. 233 00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.950 Jenny Duan: So usually, people with this prompt right about. 234 00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:09.170 Jenny Duan: They write it through like the lens of framing mechanism or story, and that looks different for every person, but there should be like a bit of a clear line of reasoning throughout the lessons. So 235 00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.484 Jenny Duan: I think one person wrote about 236 00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.230 Jenny Duan: liking tea, and, like 237 00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:23.149 Jenny Duan: wrote about how like they would invite their roommate for, like a cup of tea depending on. And then there was like different types of tea depending on like their name, or something 238 00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.820 Jenny Duan: the season. 239 00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:30.729 Jenny Duan: and like I wrote my essay about, would it be helpful to look at some example essays right now. 240 00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.610 huda: I think so. 241 00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, one second, let me pull some up. 242 00:26:52.120 --> 00:27:09.739 Jenny Duan: But honestly, like it could also just be like, kind of basic like, this is an accepted. 243 00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.089 Jenny Duan: But this is like. 244 00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.599 Jenny Duan: instead of this is not really. 245 00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.930 Jenny Duan: This is Tracy 246 00:27:16.761 --> 00:27:19.290 Jenny Duan: about the student, about the student. 247 00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.110 Jenny Duan: They did the bay in high school. So that's why it's 248 00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.249 Jenny Duan: it should be. 249 00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.609 Jenny Duan: He mentioned it. 250 00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.470 huda: Oh, okay, so this one's like a little more straightforward. I feel like this is kind of. 251 00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.690 Jenny Duan: I'll let you know how to. 252 00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.130 huda: Kind of summar's my original draft a bit. 253 00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.539 Jenny Duan: In looking at particular 254 00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.195 Jenny Duan: crazily. 255 00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.325 Jenny Duan: Bye. 256 00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.250 Jenny Duan: okay. 257 00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.220 Jenny Duan: who's available 258 00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.900 Jenny Duan: about Noodles? 259 00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.350 Jenny Duan: This one's more of like the framework. 260 00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.879 huda: this is really unique. 261 00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so that's like. 262 00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.029 Jenny Duan: that's like a more Stanford essay. 263 00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.570 Jenny Duan: and then I mean. 264 00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:29.375 Jenny Duan: so for this one, I do feel like most people have like an analogy, but it's also not necessary. 265 00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.719 huda: You think the sleep like the night owl thing is? Do you think that is cliche. 266 00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.319 Jenny Duan: It could be but 267 00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.780 Jenny Duan: like 268 00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:47.006 Jenny Duan: I don't think it matters if something is cliche, or if other people write it. But 269 00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:53.289 Jenny Duan: as long as it's like true to you like. When I was applying to Student Fair, I found this out later, but like for the most part. 270 00:30:53.370 --> 00:31:00.770 Jenny Duan: like the moment in history. Me and my other friend, who got accepted in the same year from the same city, we wrote about the same exact person 271 00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:07.330 Jenny Duan: that didn't even matter. So it's because we read about like different aspects of that person. 272 00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:20.020 Jenny Duan: So like this is also just super straightforward. And that's fine, too, like this person also thought so. There's different ways to do this. 273 00:31:52.040 --> 00:32:02.339 Jenny Duan: because at the end of the day, like not a single essay will like make or break your application. It's only a way for them to like, divide, check you, or to gain information about you, and like 274 00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:15.039 Jenny Duan: portion of their essays, is for them to like. Learn more about what they might not already know about you. So in total, they only spend 15 min looking over your entire application, including all your essays, all your letters of recommendation, all your 275 00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:19.640 Jenny Duan: everything which is really demoralizing. But it just means that, like 276 00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:24.020 Jenny Duan: you, give them a quick vibe check of who you are at that 277 00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:34.690 Jenny Duan: like they're not gonna spend more than like 2 min. So as long as you're able to get the tone of your personality across and like 278 00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:40.029 Jenny Duan: kind of him to add something that you're interested in. But he will be okay. 279 00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:51.289 huda: Yeah, I don't know. I I kind of like the current draft of the roommate essay. But I think I mean, obviously, there's like ways to improve it. 280 00:32:53.030 --> 00:33:02.480 huda: but yeah, I think I just think that like the the time, like the time frames, and then like talking about the different parts of the night. I think that one's like, really cool. 281 00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.550 huda: Hmm. 282 00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.290 huda: but like, okay. 283 00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:11.909 Jenny Duan: I I don't know. I mean I I also. I haven't seen an essay written like this. 284 00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:18.389 Jenny Duan: but I don't know what what about it. It feels cliche, or what about it? Feels like too much. 285 00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:25.270 huda: Like. I think that, like my dad feels that like rabbit Hole is like a buzzword 286 00:33:25.689 --> 00:33:29.649 huda: and like. So it's like night owl and everything and that like 287 00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.499 huda: like I, I think it's like pretty authentic. 288 00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:38.470 huda: But like he was just like worried that it might sound like too 289 00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:47.480 huda: like I'm just trying to like copy like Stanford lingo, or like, I don't know. I just I feel like it fits. Actually, I had a like a an idea. 290 00:33:47.808 --> 00:34:00.770 huda: I could do like instead of like a like a nighttime routine. I could just do like a skincare routine, and then and then, like each step of the skincare I could like reveal something about myself. And so like 291 00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.349 huda: this, like this would apply so that for example. 292 00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.320 huda: like 293 00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:26.029 huda: like, for example, like Toner, which is supposed to like, soothe you. I can talk about like my comforts like for example, I like reading and listening to music and like I'd like have a conversation with my roommate. And that could be like like related in that way. And then maybe, like 294 00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:32.280 huda: exfoliator could be like what like energizes me and like, what like makes me passionate. 295 00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.399 huda: And then, 296 00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.529 huda: like, I'm just thinking out loud. But 297 00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:39.320 huda: yeah, like something like that. 298 00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:44.089 Jenny Duan: Tell me more about how or why skincare is important. 299 00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.619 huda: I think like, like 300 00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:54.149 huda: like my family knows that, like I've struggled with with acne for like a bulk of like like 301 00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:01.129 huda: like for a while, basically. And so I guess, like, I have like a strict routine. And that's like 302 00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:10.949 huda: it hasn't really just like helped me like, get like better with like my skincare, but it's also like helped me like gain a discipline, so that, like, after I do my skincare, I journal 303 00:35:11.288 --> 00:35:16.069 huda: like I set a routine for me, so that, like now, I'm disciplined and like 304 00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.020 huda: I do all these different things on time. I guess. 305 00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.190 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say like 306 00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:34.499 Jenny Duan: fair instead of fair warning on the night. Oh, you can say like, Are you ready for the sleepover of a lifetime. 307 00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:47.180 Jenny Duan: You're right about how like you're a big fan of routines, maybe about how like you'll remember their birthday and like, make sure to surprise them with like the full birthday shower, which is something that people at Stanford doing their freshman year like they 308 00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:59.830 Jenny Duan: whenever it's someone's birthday at midnight, the whole dorm like they like. Take the person and they like, throw them in the shower, and they'll like sick for that like fully, with their clothes on. It's it's I mean, you can opt out of it. If you don't want to do anything. It's like a tradition. 309 00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:04.829 Jenny Duan: So maybe you can write about how like you're a big fan of routines like you're. 310 00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:16.929 Jenny Duan: You don't have to write about the birthday shower, but maybe like, try to involve your roommate, and like you like walk you'll like, remember something that's important to them, or like you'll involve them in like one of your you talk about like 311 00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.060 Jenny Duan: every night. You'll probably catch me doing? My. 312 00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:27.959 Jenny Duan: you know, 12 step skincare routine, or, you know, 5 step or 3 step skincare routine, and then you can do like the same. 313 00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.610 Jenny Duan: We're not like the time, but like steps. 314 00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:32.710 Jenny Duan: What do you think? 315 00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.450 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 316 00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:44.879 huda: Yeah, I think that's that's definitely like, yeah, I think I like that. And then I think the part with like the birthday showers. I think that also, adds another Stanford element. I guess. 317 00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000 Jenny Duan: Okay, maybe keep this essay, for now and then just write your new essay like Below it. 318 00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.000 huda: Easy. 319 00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:57.699 Jenny Duan: Want to keep this the same, because I also like I really like the sesay, too. I don't think it's too 320 00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:05.469 Jenny Duan: like I don't think Niall is a buzzword. I mean, it's it's not a buzzword, but it is like a word that people will understand. 321 00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:17.199 huda: Yeah, I think. I mean, I think this new idea it might be good, but I feel like the like the 9 1 1 might be like a little more like 322 00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.269 huda: like more understandable like, it might be easier to write. But I think, yeah, I mean, like. 323 00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.690 huda: I'll just give it a try and see if I like it. 324 00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:30.969 Jenny Duan: Yeah, give it a try. And then, if you don't like it, it's fine. I think the biggest thing that 325 00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:42.520 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest thing about college applications is, you should just present yourself authentically, and that way the school will like accept you for who you are, because you don't want to be like 326 00:37:43.080 --> 00:38:01.100 Jenny Duan: you don't want the school to accept like, say that you wrote your essays in a way that's not totally unlike you. You wouldn't want the school to accept someone who isn't you, because that means that, like you might not actually fit in school culture, you might not be happy there, because, like admissions officers. They want people who they know will be like happy there. And so if you 327 00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.919 Jenny Duan: present yourself in a way that isn't authentic to you, like you're doing yourself a disservice, because then, like 328 00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:21.069 Jenny Duan: this version of you might not like fit in well with the student body, or you might not enjoy being there, which is like a really important part of college, because it's like a mutual fit. You are looking for this college. But like they're also looking for building the class that's like. 329 00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:29.510 Jenny Duan: like, gets along well with each other and like contributes diverse to the environment there. And so yeah, like. 330 00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.813 Jenny Duan: yeah, anyway, that's just real. Okay? And then this essay is is finalized. 331 00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.770 Jenny Duan: right? 332 00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.320 Jenny Duan: Did you have you changed this since yesterday? 333 00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.290 huda: No. 334 00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:44.355 Jenny Duan: Alright. 335 00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.669 Jenny Duan: This information is close to popular. 336 00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. 337 00:38:52.640 --> 00:39:04.960 Jenny Duan: where is truth? Amid all the time? I would say, Show your dad this if he gets it. I don't know if this is too like 338 00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:10.330 Jenny Duan: I mean, chances are your ambitious officers will be younger, but I don't know if this is too like Gen. Z.

Did you change it? It looks different. 6 00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.650 huda: Oh, thank you. Yeah. I changed my parting so. 7 00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.760 Jenny Duan: Okay, is my microphone. Okay? Or sorry. 8 00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.960 Jenny Duan: Switched it. 2 things. 9 00:01:02.684 --> 00:01:07.300 huda: It's a little like I I'm having difficulties hearing you, but. 10 00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.449 Jenny Duan: Is this better or worse? 11 00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.770 huda: I think this is better. Yeah. 12 00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.679 Jenny Duan: Let's just do that for now let me know if it's like too distracting areas. If you can hear me, then that's okay. 13 00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:35.250 Jenny Duan: Alright. So. Do you want to start with your would you like to start with reviewing your standard short answers? Or would you like to go back to your comment? 14 00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:41.599 huda: I guess I'll just give a quick kind of like update on the Stanford essays. 15 00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:48.699 huda: So I showed my dad all the essays, and he really liked the last one. About like 16 00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:57.580 huda: like contribution essay. That one he thought that, like the roommate essay it could be tweaked a little cause. 17 00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:16.380 huda: I think, he said, that like the night owl thing is a bit cliche, and that he's seen it in like a lot of essays, and that and that like, maybe the rabbit holding part like, I think he just didn't really quite understand or like he doesn't. He didn't really like the term. I'm not sure why, but 18 00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:2",
    "1.879 huda: yeah. And then for the 1st essay, which is about like the curiosity essay 19 00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:34.010 huda: he liked parts of it so like the part where it talks about what like, where I was wondering, like the statistical journey of the rice in my mother's palau and then like 20 00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:43.179 huda: that he liked that part, and he just felt like it could be more personalized and like some like this part. Where, I say. 21 00:02:43.440 --> 00:03:00.039 huda: how can our DNA reshape the narrative? Our migration? He said. That was fine. And then the why do people people's favorite colors shift over time. Can social media predict predict culture trends? He said. He just like thought it sounded like, I was just putting a few questions there. 22 00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:05.780 huda: And it didn't really relate to me or anything. But yeah, I was like wondering what you think. 23 00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that 24 00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.799 Jenny Duan: that makes sense. I think that social media predicting cultural trends isn't that irrelevant? 25 00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.426 Jenny Duan: Isn't that the line that we added, based on? Or was that something different? 26 00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.850 huda: That was the computer science, education and financial disparity. 27 00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:45.840 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I I see what he. Okay, I see that point there. So let's just go back and edit that. So I say, 3 dots finalized. Would you say like your dad? Or does he have any questions about that one? 28 00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.379 huda: I think he like he liked that one, so he didn't really have anything. 29 00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.949 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's go back to the 1st and say, I do agree that yeah. 30 00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:04.250 Jenny Duan: that some parts of this could be made more personalized. But I also think that it is good as it is. But if we want to make it more personalized, maybe 31 0",
    "0:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.760 Jenny Duan: let's look. Let's start here. So a separate deep dive into data visualization. Is there a way that you could make that connect to something about you? 32 00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.440 huda: Like, maybe 33 00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:33.579 huda: maybe like, instead of like a subreddit deep dive into data visualization, I can took a deep dive into 34 00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.280 huda: like. 35 00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:52.929 huda: I don't know. This is not really in my profile, but it could be something like like one of the different things about me, like, for example, a subreddit deep dive on like music ranking, or something like that. Cause that that because it's also like data. 36 00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:00.200 huda: It's also I also really like listening to music. But like, yeah, I actually don't know if that really relates to my profile. 37 00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.000 huda: yeah. 38 00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.659 Jenny Duan: What's like one of your favorite music artists. 39 00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:11.389 huda: Maybe Billy Joel. 40 00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:29.469 Jenny Duan: Maybe. The spotify data visualization on Billy Joel pop up pop tracks 41 00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.462 Jenny Duan: something like that. 42 00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:37.205 Jenny Duan: What do you think. 43 00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.670 huda: Yeah, I like that. 44 00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.188 Jenny Duan: Alright. Well, another tax! 45 00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.190 Jenny Duan: How does this relate? I feel like you already. Talk about. 46 00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.490 huda: Like. 47 00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.510 Jenny Duan: Migration here, so we don't need to talk about. 48 00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.620 huda: Yeah, I think something different. 49 00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.159 huda: So possibly 50 00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.200 huda: maybe like, even like the Ap score distribution. 51 00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.189 huda: I don't know if that relates 52 00:06:16.460 --",
    "> 00:06:18.019 Jenny Duan: How would that relate. 53 00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.750 huda: Cause. It's like. 54 00:06:20.218 --> 00:06:36.930 huda: kind of like an academic part like, because that is like data. It's like, for example, like 25% people got like this, many people. But I guess, like, I don't know if it shows my curiosity enough, because I feel like everyone looks at that. 55 00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.100 huda: So maybe something. 56 00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.200 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if that adds anything additional to your 57 00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.970 Jenny Duan: is there something else you feel like? You can highlight here. 58 00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.850 huda: Maybe like the like. 59 00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.569 huda: like an e-sports like 60 00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.990 huda: like 61 00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.069 huda: ranking, or or kind of like 62 00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.410 huda: like a visualization, or like a dashboard to show like 63 00:07:14.838 --> 00:07:17.789 huda: like the results of like a esports competition. 64 00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:35.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes another tracks point for the latest. What's- what's the new sports game that you watch. 65 00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.900 huda: Like the. 66 00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.899 Jenny Duan: It's like I don't know. 67 00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.260 huda: Fortnight. 68 00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.589 Jenny Duan: Can you write that in? 69 00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.410 Jenny Duan: How's that. 70 00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.690 huda: Yeah, I like that. 71 00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.580 Jenny Duan: Okay. Now, let's pass through these 2 questions. 72 00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:28.760 Jenny Duan: What are other questions that are relevant to things that you do? Maybe for like journalism, you could talk about. You could connect one of these questions to like a journalism topic that you've studied or reported on. 73 00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:38.080 huda: Or like, maybe like, even in like, br",
    "oader, like circumstances like, what percent of communities aren't like reported on 74 00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.950 huda: something like that. But I. 75 00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.829 Jenny Duan: It's really good. 76 00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:45.039 huda: Yeah, I don't. I don't know if that like tells anything about data. But 77 00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:47.139 huda: I I think it is actually. 78 00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:53.460 Jenny Duan: I think it does. Because I think in these questions you want to illustrate, maybe things that you might want to answer while you're at Stanford 79 00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.650 Jenny Duan: so like, what questions would you be interested in exploring, like 3 classes or other languages? 80 00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.590 huda: And. 81 00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:27.779 Jenny Duan: Maybe something like that. And then you could talk about like, what stories 82 00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.050 Jenny Duan: make sure you proceed. But yeah. 83 00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.140 huda: Wait. Sorry! What was that? 84 00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.440 Jenny Duan: How do you feel about this census question? 85 00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.789 huda: I I think 86 00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.900 huda: it might not make sense in like the journalism context, 87 00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.310 huda: so like, maybe what percent of communities 88 00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.050 huda: like maybe 89 00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.040 huda: don't have media outlets 90 00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.719 huda: or aren't represented in media. 91 00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.530 Jenny Duan: Feels broad. 92 00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.970 huda: Hmm! 93 00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.760 huda: Wait! What was wrong with the haven't been reported on. Send question. 94 00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:44.379 Jenny Duan: It's really broad. What does it mean to be reported on? What it's just? I know I'm unclear, what that question entails and like, how you would go about solving those questions. 95 00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:53.709 hu",
    "da: Oh, yeah, I was. I meant like like, like, which communities like haven't been like like. 96 00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:00.925 huda: I guess, written about like broadcasted on like news channels 97 00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.241 huda: like represented in media, I guess, in general, but. 98 00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:16.810 Jenny Duan: That an important problem, because not all representation is given. Maybe some communities that don't need to be reported on, because there's just. 99 00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:26.319 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like, I feel like there's that's not clear. Why, that is an issue, or what how data directly contributes to solving it. Right? 100 00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.880 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 101 00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.079 huda: Then we could change this question and do something else. I'm not sure how to. 102 00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:49.699 Jenny Duan: I feel like journalism is a good lens to take this through. But I just think we need to find like a narrow question or a more targeted question about how having access to more data would solve for relating data to journalism. 103 00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:03.659 huda: Maybe this could like touch back on like the misinformation aspect. So it could be like 104 00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.660 huda: like 105 00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.330 huda: what 106 00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.420 huda: like 107 00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:25.799 huda: like, how are like our statements considered true or like, I don't know how to word it, but like talk about like misinformation, and like how like cause data can solve that by like providing like 108 00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.000 huda: proof. 109 00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.780 huda: I guess but I don't know how to word it. 110 00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:42.240 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like we should leave the misinformation for the one that say about this information, because I think, like it might be redundant to repeat it in such an errors like 111 00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.940 Jenny D",
    "uan: boundary of of writing? 112 00:12:45.855 --> 00:12:55.050 Jenny Duan: Is there another question that you want to answer? Like, maybe, like one of the Stanford classes that you want to take like what's 1 issue that you want to explore or see the answer to. 113 00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.970 huda: I'm not really sure how to connect it to journalism without like 114 00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.170 huda: cause. 115 00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:18.640 huda: cause, like like the topic of the essay, is talking about like, how like the question, like. 116 00:13:19.538 --> 00:13:23.239 huda: data can answer a question. And then. 117 00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:26.639 huda: I'm not sure how to connect that to journalism. 118 00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.600 Jenny Duan: Wait. What is the connection between data and journalism? 119 00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:42.559 huda: I mean, like data is part of journalism, because it provides these facts. And I guess, like 120 00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.539 huda: backs up whatever is brought up in journalism. 121 00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, so why is data necessary for doing. 122 00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.969 huda: So that you can differentiate like 123 00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.460 huda: just hearsay and 124 00:13:57.225 --> 00:13:57.980 huda: fact 125 00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.920 huda: misinformation. But yeah. 126 00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:10.319 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what's another way, data can be used to substantiate journalism. 127 00:14:12.338 --> 00:14:13.649 huda: Maybe you can like 128 00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:25.450 huda: show, like severity of something, because people are usually more like likely to consider something serious if they see like large numbers or like data. 129 00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe. How can we assess the severity of 130 00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.310 Jenny Duan: oh, it seems like. 131 00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.550 Jenny Duan: okay. 132 00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:56.290 Jenny Duan: you can s",
    "ay through, you can say without, wait what you said. 133 00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.580 huda: Shakespeed. 134 00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:15.970 Jenny Duan: Up to you. Whatever you think is important, maybe like for me, I would write like, how can we assess this? If this were my essay I would write, how can we assess the severity of the teenage mental health crisis through through access to social media data like something like that. 135 00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:25.499 Jenny Duan: or, like another person, might say, How do we assess the severity of the climate crisis through California wildfire disaster? 136 00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.919 Jenny Duan: Something like that. 137 00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.140 huda: Okay? And then 138 00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.150 huda: severity of 139 00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.229 huda: maybe like AI bias. 140 00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.080 huda: maybe like, should I say, like individual stories. 141 00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.869 Jenny Duan: How does that relate to data. 142 00:16:07.471 --> 00:16:09.440 huda: Cause. That is like a data point. 143 00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.850 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 144 00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:27.450 Jenny Duan: what would be an example of an individual story you would look at to identify the severity. 145 00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:42.404 huda: Like, for example, like this platform where you can like, talk about your experience with like AI bias. And then there can. There's like multiple people that submit like pieces about like, for example, 146 00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:49.060 huda: they're like, there's like an AI test proctoring service which might like negatively harm like people of color. 147 00:16:49.518 --> 00:16:58.830 huda: And then, like these, different instances are like data points to like help, like highlight, the severity of AI ethics. In daily life. 148 00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.140 Jenny Duan: Great idea. 149 00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.770 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's think about one more question. 150 00:17:04.96",
    "0 --> 00:17:08.049 Jenny Duan: Or do you think you need another question here? 151 00:17:08.585 --> 00:17:12.019 huda: I think it would be good if I could think of one more question. 152 00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:19.199 Jenny Duan: What's something else that you're curious about, or that you spend time thinking about in regards to. 153 00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.730 huda: Maybe like. 154 00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.050 huda: how like. 155 00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.379 huda: how does like a like a 156 00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.450 huda: child's education? 157 00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.589 huda: How does like childhood education lead to. 158 00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:47.800 huda: I guess, like happiness in the future like something, not happiness. It could be something like. 159 00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:54.149 huda: I feel like if I say income that's like, really basic. Because, like a lot of people will assume like, Oh, people with 160 00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:55.830 huda: like 161 00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.199 huda: higher education levels will have like a higher income. So I'm gonna do something that's like, really like 162 00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:07.550 huda: like the 2 things that don't really have a correlation. But like you that you see that there's a relationship 163 00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.290 huda: so like 164 00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.569 huda: cause I want to bring in like education somehow. So 165 00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.272 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe, like, how does a student 166 00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.219 Jenny Duan: early childhood education correspond to? 167 00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.890 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Future 168 00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.150 Jenny Duan: future outcomes. Maybe that's broad. But maybe we could just leave it at that. 169 00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.120 Jenny Duan: Excuse me. 170 00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:11.869 huda: And then I think this paragraph's fine. I think this question might actually, if I can't think of anything else, I could jus",
    "t put this like early childhood education part over here. 171 00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:15.369 huda: The disease outbreaks via Google search. 172 00:19:15.843 --> 00:19:19.290 huda: I think that one I definitely need to replace. 173 00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Maybe something else. More. Specific. 174 00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.450 Jenny Duan: Good. 175 00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.430 huda: From. 176 00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:38.220 huda: I don't know if I want to repeat like music again. But like predicting like 177 00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.862 huda: oh, I guess I guess I don't really wanna repeat that again. So 178 00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.710 huda: predicting 179 00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.150 huda: maybe like predicting the next 180 00:20:06.671 --> 00:20:10.910 huda: biggest podcast through Google searches or something like that. 181 00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.959 Jenny Duan: Is that something that you've done? 182 00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.669 Jenny Duan: Everything is all 3, but. 183 00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:26.999 huda: I mean, yeah, I mean, like, I can see, like 184 00:20:27.764 --> 00:20:30.140 huda: based off of like 185 00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:37.269 huda: trends and like like the way social media is like what they talk about. And then seeing like different podcasts. 186 00:20:37.724 --> 00:20:45.580 huda: and seeing, like their topics, that they discuss like predicting like, oh, this one will probably get popular because it's talking about like this topic. 187 00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:54.099 Jenny Duan: That sounds good. I just changed it to via Google. Search trends because I know that that's publicly accessible. 188 00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.089 Jenny Duan: Don't take a moment, sir. 189 00:21:08.174 --> 00:21:13.520 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay. But how do you feel about this? 190 00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.759 huda: I feel like it's a lot better now. Yeah. 191 00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.850 Jenny Duan: We were 10 words over. So I think we need to cut 1",
    "0 words. 192 00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.699 huda: I think I could. 193 00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.469 huda: I feel like this sent. This question could be removed. I don't know if it's too like. 194 00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.960 huda: is it? 195 00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.120 Jenny Duan: It's done, we'll be just. 196 00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.340 Jenny Duan: Oh. 197 00:21:44.773 --> 00:21:48.106 Jenny Duan: that's exactly 2 pictures. 198 00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.050 huda: That's too late. 199 00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. Okay, let's go to the future review. 200 00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.835 Jenny Duan: So. 201 00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.960 Jenny Duan: my God. 202 00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:08.970 Jenny Duan: we want to redo this. If we want to get rid of this night, owl and rabbit holding analogies. 203 00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.579 Jenny Duan: Maybe we just start over and choose a new analogy. Or do you think this is salvageable, or like? What was your dad's feedback. 204 00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:20.700 huda: I mean, I personally think that 205 00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:29.030 huda: I personally think that it. I feel like it's still good. And I think that, like I'm effectively like showing different aspects of like 206 00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:37.549 huda: who I am through this essay. But I like I'm not sure like, if do you think that, like the night owl like, do you think that's like 207 00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:43.869 huda: done a lot, or it's like cliche cause? If so, then then I think I'm fine with like 208 00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.170 huda: like restarting this, because, like the whole premise of this is like doing stuff late at night. 209 00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:56.279 huda: But actually, no, I think this is salvageable, because, like some of these things like I could even be doing like during the day, or something like that. 210 00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:06.060 Jenny Duan: Okay, so how do you want to? I guess. Reformat this with the different framing,",
    " or what are your thoughts? Yeah. 211 00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.870 huda: So I'm I'm not really sure like what like analogy to like, replace it with 212 00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:21.420 huda: which is probably like the 1st step I should take. But 213 00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.519 huda: oh, yeah, also. My dad also said that I'm missing like the component where 214 00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:33.660 huda: I have to show like how I'll care for the roommate, like, for example, like a lot of essays, talk about like 215 00:23:34.089 --> 00:23:44.559 huda: them, for example, like bringing tea for them, or something like that, like how I'd interact with their roommates. So I think he said that was missing as well. So 216 00:23:44.977 --> 00:23:48.970 huda: that's also one thing to consider when I'm writing the new draft. But 217 00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.829 huda: hmm! I can't think of any analogies right now. But 218 00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:09.950 huda: maybe actually. What if I like? What if I did describe like my poster wall, and then, like each poster, could have like a significance 219 00:24:10.314 --> 00:24:18.590 huda: like, for example, like on my poster wall, I like hung like a receipt of like when we went to like a jazz cafe. 220 00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:36.619 huda: I think coho! And so and then that could be like I could discuss like that, and then I could also discuss like reading, and like that aspect. And then I could do like another, or like the Ada Lovelace thing is already a poster, so I don't really need to change that. And then I can have like a poster for 221 00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.170 huda: like, let me just. 222 00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.080 huda: I could have like a poster, for like a game that I play like, for example. 223 00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.860 huda: like. 224 00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.420 huda: maybe just like valorant, or something like that, like I could have a poster for that 225 00:24:55.914 --> 00:24:57.290 huda: and then, like each 226 00:24:",
    "57.410 --> 00:25:01.399 huda: like poster, would signify signify something. 227 00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:11.909 Jenny Duan: Wait. I feel like that might also feel a bit like I think that's probably also an overdone analogy. 228 00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:12.830 huda: Oh! 229 00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.020 Jenny Duan: Is there anything else you can think of. 230 00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.461 huda: Well, I can't think of any analogy, said 231 00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:29.490 Jenny Duan: Sorry. Not analogy. Just like, I guess, framing mechanism for this lesson doesn't have to be analogy. 232 00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:50.510 huda: I'm not sure like I'm not sure how to approach the the prompt. 233 00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.950 Jenny Duan: So usually, people with this prompt right about. 234 00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:09.170 Jenny Duan: They write it through like the lens of framing mechanism or story, and that looks different for every person, but there should be like a bit of a clear line of reasoning throughout the lessons. So 235 00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.484 Jenny Duan: I think one person wrote about 236 00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.230 Jenny Duan: liking tea, and, like 237 00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:23.149 Jenny Duan: wrote about how like they would invite their roommate for, like a cup of tea depending on. And then there was like different types of tea depending on like their name, or something 238 00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.820 Jenny Duan: the season. 239 00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:30.729 Jenny Duan: and like I wrote my essay about, would it be helpful to look at some example essays right now. 240 00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.610 huda: I think so. 241 00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, one second, let me pull some up. 242 00:26:52.120 --> 00:27:09.739 Jenny Duan: But honestly, like it could also just be like, kind of basic like, this is an accepted. 243 00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.089 Jenny Duan: But this is like. 244 00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.599 Jenny Duan: instead of this is not re",
    "ally. 245 00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.930 Jenny Duan: This is Tracy 246 00:27:16.761 --> 00:27:19.290 Jenny Duan: about the student, about the student. 247 00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.110 Jenny Duan: They did the bay in high school. So that's why it's 248 00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.249 Jenny Duan: it should be. 249 00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.609 Jenny Duan: He mentioned it. 250 00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.470 huda: Oh, okay, so this one's like a little more straightforward. I feel like this is kind of. 251 00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.690 Jenny Duan: I'll let you know how to. 252 00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.130 huda: Kind of summar's my original draft a bit. 253 00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.539 Jenny Duan: In looking at particular 254 00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.195 Jenny Duan: crazily. 255 00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.325 Jenny Duan: Bye. 256 00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.250 Jenny Duan: okay. 257 00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.220 Jenny Duan: who's available 258 00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.900 Jenny Duan: about Noodles? 259 00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.350 Jenny Duan: This one's more of like the framework. 260 00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.879 huda: this is really unique. 261 00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.150 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so that's like. 262 00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.029 Jenny Duan: that's like a more Stanford essay. 263 00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.570 Jenny Duan: and then I mean. 264 00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:29.375 Jenny Duan: so for this one, I do feel like most people have like an analogy, but it's also not necessary. 265 00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.719 huda: You think the sleep like the night owl thing is? Do you think that is cliche. 266 00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.319 Jenny Duan: It could be but 267 00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.780 Jenny Duan: like 268 00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:47.006 Jenny Duan: I don't think it matters if something is cliche, or if other people write it. But 269 00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:53.289 Jenny Duan: as long as it's like true to you like. When I was applying to Student Fair, I found this",
    " out later, but like for the most part. 270 00:30:53.370 --> 00:31:00.770 Jenny Duan: like the moment in history. Me and my other friend, who got accepted in the same year from the same city, we wrote about the same exact person 271 00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:07.330 Jenny Duan: that didn't even matter. So it's because we read about like different aspects of that person. 272 00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:20.020 Jenny Duan: So like this is also just super straightforward. And that's fine, too, like this person also thought so. There's different ways to do this. 273 00:31:52.040 --> 00:32:02.339 Jenny Duan: because at the end of the day, like not a single essay will like make or break your application. It's only a way for them to like, divide, check you, or to gain information about you, and like 274 00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:15.039 Jenny Duan: portion of their essays, is for them to like. Learn more about what they might not already know about you. So in total, they only spend 15 min looking over your entire application, including all your essays, all your letters of recommendation, all your 275 00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:19.640 Jenny Duan: everything which is really demoralizing. But it just means that, like 276 00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:24.020 Jenny Duan: you, give them a quick vibe check of who you are at that 277 00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:34.690 Jenny Duan: like they're not gonna spend more than like 2 min. So as long as you're able to get the tone of your personality across and like 278 00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:40.029 Jenny Duan: kind of him to add something that you're interested in. But he will be okay. 279 00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:51.289 huda: Yeah, I don't know. I I kind of like the current draft of the roommate essay. But I think I mean, obviously, there's like ways to improve it. 280 00:32:53.030 --> 00:33:02.480 huda: but yeah, I think I just think that like the the time, like the time frames, and then like talking about the different parts of the night. I think that one's like, real",
    "ly cool. 281 00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.550 huda: Hmm. 282 00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.290 huda: but like, okay. 283 00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:11.909 Jenny Duan: I I don't know. I mean I I also. I haven't seen an essay written like this. 284 00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:18.389 Jenny Duan: but I don't know what what about it. It feels cliche, or what about it? Feels like too much. 285 00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:25.270 huda: Like. I think that, like my dad feels that like rabbit Hole is like a buzzword 286 00:33:25.689 --> 00:33:29.649 huda: and like. So it's like night owl and everything and that like 287 00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.499 huda: like I, I think it's like pretty authentic. 288 00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:38.470 huda: But like he was just like worried that it might sound like too 289 00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:47.480 huda: like I'm just trying to like copy like Stanford lingo, or like, I don't know. I just I feel like it fits. Actually, I had a like a an idea. 290 00:33:47.808 --> 00:34:00.770 huda: I could do like instead of like a like a nighttime routine. I could just do like a skincare routine, and then and then, like each step of the skincare I could like reveal something about myself. And so like 291 00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.349 huda: this, like this would apply so that for example. 292 00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.320 huda: like 293 00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:26.029 huda: like, for example, like Toner, which is supposed to like, soothe you. I can talk about like my comforts like for example, I like reading and listening to music and like I'd like have a conversation with my roommate. And that could be like like related in that way. And then maybe, like 294 00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:32.280 huda: exfoliator could be like what like energizes me and like, what like makes me passionate. 295 00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.399 huda: And then, 296 00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.529 huda: like, I'm just thinking out loud. But 297 00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:39.320 huda: yeah, like something like that. 298 0",
    "0:34:40.550 --> 00:34:44.089 Jenny Duan: Tell me more about how or why skincare is important. 299 00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.619 huda: I think like, like 300 00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:54.149 huda: like my family knows that, like I've struggled with with acne for like a bulk of like like 301 00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:01.129 huda: like for a while, basically. And so I guess, like, I have like a strict routine. And that's like 302 00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:10.949 huda: it hasn't really just like helped me like, get like better with like my skincare, but it's also like helped me like gain a discipline, so that, like, after I do my skincare, I journal 303 00:35:11.288 --> 00:35:16.069 huda: like I set a routine for me, so that, like now, I'm disciplined and like 304 00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.020 huda: I do all these different things on time. I guess. 305 00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.190 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say like 306 00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:34.499 Jenny Duan: fair instead of fair warning on the night. Oh, you can say like, Are you ready for the sleepover of a lifetime. 307 00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:47.180 Jenny Duan: You're right about how like you're a big fan of routines, maybe about how like you'll remember their birthday and like, make sure to surprise them with like the full birthday shower, which is something that people at Stanford doing their freshman year like they 308 00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:59.830 Jenny Duan: whenever it's someone's birthday at midnight, the whole dorm like they like. Take the person and they like, throw them in the shower, and they'll like sick for that like fully, with their clothes on. It's it's I mean, you can opt out of it. If you don't want to do anything. It's like a tradition. 309 00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:04.829 Jenny Duan: So maybe you can write about how like you're a big fan of routines like you're. 310 00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:16.929 Jenny Duan: You don't have to write about the birthday shower, but maybe like, try to involve your roommate, and ",
    "like you like walk you'll like, remember something that's important to them, or like you'll involve them in like one of your you talk about like 311 00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.060 Jenny Duan: every night. You'll probably catch me doing? My. 312 00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:27.959 Jenny Duan: you know, 12 step skincare routine, or, you know, 5 step or 3 step skincare routine, and then you can do like the same. 313 00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.610 Jenny Duan: We're not like the time, but like steps. 314 00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:32.710 Jenny Duan: What do you think? 315 00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.450 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 316 00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:44.879 huda: Yeah, I think that's that's definitely like, yeah, I think I like that. And then I think the part with like the birthday showers. I think that also, adds another Stanford element. I guess. 317 00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000 Jenny Duan: Okay, maybe keep this essay, for now and then just write your new essay like Below it. 318 00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.000 huda: Easy. 319 00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:57.699 Jenny Duan: Want to keep this the same, because I also like I really like the sesay, too.

I mean, it's it's not a buzzword, but it is like a word that people will understand. 321 00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:17.199 huda: Yeah, I think. I mean, I think this new idea it might be good, but I feel like the like the 9 1 1 might be like a little more like 322 00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.269 huda: like more understandable like, it might be easier to write.

And then, if you don't like it, it's fine. I think the biggest thing that 325 00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:42.520 Jenny Duan: I think the biggest thing about college applications is, you should just present yourse",
    "lf authentically, and that way the school will like accept you for who you are, because you don't want to be like 326 00:37:43.080 --> 00:38:01.100 Jenny Duan: you don't want the school to accept like, say that you wrote your essays in a way that's not totally unlike you. You wouldn't want the school to accept someone who isn't you, because that means that, like you might not actually fit in school culture, you might not be happy there, because, like admissions officers. They want people who they know will be like happy there. And so if you 327 00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.919 Jenny Duan: present yourself in a way that isn't authentic to you, like you're doing yourself a disservice, because then, like 328 00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:21.069 Jenny Duan: this version of you might not like fit in well with the student body, or you might not enjoy being there, which is like a really important part of college, because it's like a mutual fit. You are looking for this college. But like they're also looking for building the class that's like. 329 00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:29.510 Jenny Duan: like, gets along well with each other and like contributes diverse to the environment there. And so yeah, like. 330 00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.813 Jenny Duan: yeah, anyway, that's just real. Okay? And then this essay is is finalized. 331 00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.770 Jenny Duan: right? 332 00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.320 Jenny Duan: Did you have you changed this since yesterday? 333 00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.290 huda: No. 334 00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:44.355 Jenny Duan: Alright. 335 00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.669 Jenny Duan: This information is close to popular. 336 00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. 337 00:38:52.640 --> 00:39:04.960 Jenny Duan: where is truth?
