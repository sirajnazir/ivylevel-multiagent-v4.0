How's it going? 2 00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.210 huda: Hi! It's going. Well, how are you? 3 00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:54.490 Jenny Duan: I'm going well, too. awesome. Well, it's nice to see you again. Were you? How's everything going? Actually, yeah. 4 00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.139 huda: it's going. Well, 5 00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:09.290 huda: yeah, we're still like, kind of locking in our course selections. And I'm still kind of like in a dilemma. If I should take a peek lit or not, cause I just I don't wanna like fail miserably. So. 6 00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.470 huda: yeah, yeah. 7 00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.749 Jenny Duan: yeah. Sign up, are you? Is it possible for me to change? 8 00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.070 huda: you can change until like August first, I believe. 9 00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.650 Jenny Duan: is that after like, can you change after school starts? No. 10 00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.790 hmm. 11 00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:41.130 Jenny Duan: So like you don't. You're not allowed to change like. let's say, if you don't, Link Ap. Let you can't switch out of it once. Cost starts 12 00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:55.040 huda: I think, like this year. They didn't do this last year, but this year they allowed each drop like ap courses for flex period, or normal class. But I don't. I don't know if I could still do that 13 00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.850 Jenny Duan: next year. Would they let you go? Would you like? Would they let you go back to the honors? 14 00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.710 huda: I can ask my counsellor, but I don't think that was the case this year. 15 00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:16.379 Jenny Duan: Wait. Can you ask your counselor? Because if you're able to go back to the honors, then it's then it's easy. You just sign up for Ap lit. But if not historically, what have your English grades been? 16 00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:29.039 huda: Well, I've had like an 8 throughout high school, but like I know, literature is like a lot of like reading and analyzing. And I'm kind of better at writing than reading. So. 17 00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.680 Jenny Duan: okay, do you know what the apulete teacher's like, because 18 00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.599 ap Latin High School was my favorite class, like it was. It was like my favorite high school class like 19 00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:47.200 Jenny Duan: ever, even though I'm not really a writer, but like I love that class because I had a great teacher. So I think, do you know what your teachers like? 20 00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:57.439 huda: I heard she was strict. But like, I mean, like, usually, I have like a good relationship with my English teachers, because, like, I kind of buttered them up. But yeah. 21 00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.110 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel like you shouldn't be scared. And I think you should go with Ap. Lit. But 22 00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.379 Jenny Duan: do you like? Do you think that you won't survive if you do, if you lit. 23 00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:22.650 huda: I'm just like considering cause like like I know 5 ap is like, might be a lot for me to handle but at the same time I feel like if I just like kind of work hard these 2 semesters. 24 00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.250 huda: It might be better for me. So I think I'm just gonna go forward with Ap lit. 25 00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:51.370 Jenny Duan: I think you should talk to your teacher and see if you're able to drop down to the honors if Ap. Lit doesn't work out, but I think, regardless you should just send out for Ap. Lit. Because, remember this, in your senior year you don't have to take any ap test at the end of the year, like in May. If you don't want to take the test, you don't have to also maintain your grades for maximum one semester. If that at all. Like best case, you get into your early decision school, Usc, and then you're done. 26 00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.610 huda: But like. 27 00:07:53.290 --> 00:08:10.010 huda: Oh, yeah, I had a question about Usc, I was actually like looking up like the kind of statistics on how people get accepted. And I think the and I think the acceptance rate for usc. Was higher during regular decision than early decision. 28 00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.790 Jenny Duan: Oh, really, that's interesting. Let me look it up. So good. 29 00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:25.849 Jenny Duan: It's actually a good Good point. Okay? So you're gonna see a 12.5%. La, la, let's see 30 00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.189 Jenny Duan: here, let's see. 31 00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:51.210 Jenny Duan: is it crimson website? So I'm not sure. No, because on this 32 00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.460 Jenny Duan: early action 33 00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.490 Oh, I don't think there's actually early decision. Early action is great. 34 00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:06.270 Jenny Duan: Early action is non binding and non restrictive. Okay, that's perfect. 35 00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.100 Jenny Duan: Well, okay, that's good. 36 00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:20.580 Jenny Duan: and you'll also be considered for us to see merit scholarships. Okay, that's also good. See? They say we estimate that 20 to 25% of our admissions base will be granted during the Ea. 37 00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:29.209 Jenny Duan: So I mean, that doesn't mean that the acceptance rates 2025%. That just means that they're filling like a fifth to a quarter of their spots. 38 00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.390 Jenny Duan: Okay? Well, I think you should just apply earlier, anyways, because 39 00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:43.250 Jenny Duan: because it'll put you in eligibility for their merit scholarships, which I think would be just be like good in general. 40 00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:55.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Given that Usc is let me just write this on Usc is early action given that Usc is early action. Do you want to early decision any. Would you have any early decision schools? 41 00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.000 huda: I think. Maybe, like Stanford 42 00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:12.320 Jenny Duan: Stanford is also rest. San Francis. Restrictive early action, which means. If you apply to Stanford, you can't apply for Usc in the early action round. But that's also like that's also like fine, though, cause you could just apply for Usc 43 00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.250 Jenny Duan: regular decision, I guess. 44 00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.899 huda: Yeah. Hmm. 45 00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:23.530 huda: I think I'd rather apply to Usc early action because 46 00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.190 huda: I don't know, like I feel like 47 00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:38.840 huda: Stanford early act, I mean, like regular decision for Usc. Might not be the best, just as you said, like getting like the merit scholarship. I'd be qualified. So 48 00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.369 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think it's a better choice policy. I don't know if it 49 00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.000 Jenny Duan: I don't know if it 50 00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.629 Jenny Duan: is it? 51 00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.730 Jenny Duan: You may not? Yeah, you might not apply to any 52 00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.899 Jenny Duan: other private college under their early action. Restrictive early action early as an early notification. 53 00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:22.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So you can't apply to any, you see, wouldn't be able to apply to Usc. If you applied to Stanford. So I think that you know I think it would be best to apply for Usc early action. That way you can do the merit scholarships, and then you can just apply for Stanford in the regular decision round. But hopefully you won't have to do that because you'll get into Usc, actually, if you get to Usc, will you still want to apply for other schools? Or do you think you'll be like done after that? 54 00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:37.299 huda: I think I'd wanna share for Stanford, because obviously, I kinda prioritize. I just, I kinda like, realize how important it is to be like closer to home. So I think, like, yeah, definitely, I'm gonna still try for Stanford. 55 00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:44.339 Jenny Duan: Okay? So like, then, Stanford, be like your second choice school, and Usc would be your number one school, you would say. 56 00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:54.479 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, cool. So then Usc, first, and then all this Ucs, and then Stanford and everything else will be regular decision. Okay, that makes sense to me. 57 00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:18.090 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Okay. How's everything else going with AI, everything else. Yeah. So an update on Santori, I think I posted it and an Indie game developers group and Linkedin, and that was like able to get like a lot of engagement, and like also like a lot of phase from that so like, I think that was like. 58 00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:29.650 huda: kinda I'm glad that kind of happened. And I also did connect with like a lot of like game developers. In the industry already. And I've like, been chatting with them. 59 00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:35.230 huda: And then I think, right now, I have like 150 plays on my game. 60 00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:45.529 huda: yeah. And I also like an update. So game, women and games. It was like, I found that this group. I think it's 61 00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:55.459 huda: it was like a discord, like. I think it's like larger than discord. But like they have like conferences and speaker events and stuff. 62 00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:17.230 huda: And so it's kinda like trying to figure out how I can become an app ambassador and so like they didn't really specify like the age requirements. So then I went in the discord, and I've been asking so like, they're trying to reach to the like coordinator to see if she'll let me. But yeah, like I'm trying to clean my case. But yeah, I think you definitely can. That'd be great. 63 00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:30.760 Jenny Duan: You should also connect with women and games like just the professional mentors like, are there mentors or people that can maybe help you like publish your game or like, give your game more reach or amplify that in any way. 64 00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:50.450 huda: Yeah, I think, like, there's like a lot of like industry already. And I can like definitely connect to them and like, ask them, like on their tips on how they like publicize their games cause there are like a lot of indie game developers as well. And I've already like connected to a few, but I can like ask them now. 65 00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.209 Jenny Duan: Awesome. What would be the responsibility of an ambassador if you became one? 66 00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:11.069 huda: So I have to like kind of take control of their social media for some time and then like, create content for them. Sometimes. And then I'd have to participate in like the virtual meetings. 67 00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:27.029 huda: Well, I'm gonna pull it up. But there's like only a few that's good that aligns with the rest like this stuff that you're already doing to? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I also to bring something up so like my friend. She was doing like this like. 68 00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:46.150 huda: biomed kind of like card. It's like, it's like a nonprofit trying to spread awareness about cardiovascular like diseases and stuff. And she asked me to be like like secretary, or like publicity of the nonprofit. And like basically take charge of the social media. 69 00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:58.729 huda: I said, yes for now, but like I don't. I'm not really putting too much time into it. But II think just like having that rule like, do you recommend like putting more effort into it or 70 00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.110 huda: do you think it doesn't align? 71 00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.439 Jenny Duan: I think it doesn't really align like is health related right? And I feel like, you know. 72 00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So II didn't really wanna do it. But 73 00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:18.009 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm just like kinda just doing it to help her out. But yeah, you could maybe, like, refer someone else you might be interested in helping to instead of you doing it. 74 00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.830 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's like not worth your time. 75 00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:28.309 huda: I agree. Let me find, like the the women and games responsibility actually 76 00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.740 here and again. 77 00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.249 huda: Oh, yeah. And I also like. 78 00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:52.389 huda: I started writing like, my Notre Dame essays, but I don't really like them. So maybe you could go over them and it tell me unlike what I can change. 79 00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.919 Awesome. Yeah. 80 00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.389 Jenny Duan: How is comparing Vi and folklift going? 81 00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:16.500 huda: Yeah. So it's not too many updates on that. But I did connect with my vice President and the stem sisters is the person that we're collaborating with, and I don't know if I told you this already, but we set a date for the event, which is the fifteenth? 82 00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:24.669 huda: I think I did tell you this. But yeah, I think we're gonna like start getting more technical. I think we need to set up a call. But 83 00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.689 huda: yeah, that's like, kind of all. We didn't get much progress for that 84 00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.820 Jenny Duan: boy. No worries. That sounds good. 85 00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:50.300 Jenny Duan: that's okay, let me just look back and see. I wanna finish up this like your activities. Sort of going backwards on that oh, for the service award thing. I think for the turn up activism thing. Are you able to basically like, create your own project within that? Is it really flexible? 86 00:16:51.090 --> 00:17:00.849 huda: I think so like, I think, like, I don't know, because they haven't really gotten back yet. 87 00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.849 huda: but yeah, it's like, kind of more activism oriented and 88 00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:14.210 huda: I think it's like, if you get involved with like activities in your area. let me double check, though. 89 00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:29.740 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! Because, like, there's a chance with those types of things if you're able to. Well, also, thanks for studying that, I think about the ambassadors. I think so. Back to the turn up to something. If you're able to self direct, you can just count all the hours you work for like empowering a I folklift, and just like. 90 00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.849 Jenny Duan: put those in for the award. 91 00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.680 huda: Yeah, I think the school provides that awards. So 92 00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.120 huda: I don't know if they'll allow it. But yeah. 93 00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.600 Jenny Duan: okay, because I think that that could be like a good thing to to try. 94 00:17:46.720 --> 00:18:11.009 Jenny Duan: cool, I think. Oh, another random thing is, I sent you like a bay area creative foundation thing. I think you can apply for this award. If you'd like to. You can submit like a film that you've already done, or I think you might qualify for. Oh, never mind. Submissions are now close. Okay. I wanted to open again. 95 00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.530 Jenny Duan: Okay. 96 00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.969 Jenny Duan: to December thirteenth. Okay, never mind, then. 97 00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.159 Jenny Duan: But next year. If you wanna submit, you could submit like your 98 00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.990 Jenny Duan: visual art. I think you can probably submit like games like I feel like that would be fine for visual art, or you could submit. Fill. 99 00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:37.600 Jenny Duan: Okay. But I guess that is close now. So that's okay. Okay, anyways, let's talk about your Notre Dame essays. Now. 100 00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.720 Jenny Duan: So these are your rough drafts. Right? 101 00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:50.749 huda: Okay? I kind of for the first one, I kind of like use the one from bank of America and kind of like changed it. So it fit the question. 102 00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:57.679 Jenny Duan: In the past 4 decades the United States has experienced an unprecedented rise. Are there viable solutions. 103 00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.869 Jenny Duan: Okay. the power of investing is actually the one that I did. So let me. 104 00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.030 Jenny Duan: let's get my essays. 105 00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:23.210 huda: Yes, okay. I was actually like, I was considering whether I should do the power of investing or the American like disparity one. And I actually have, like 106 00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.859 huda: I have look a 107 00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.709 huda: rough draft for that one as well. So 108 00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.589 Jenny Duan: okay. When I did it, the questions were like, much different. 109 00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.619 Jenny Duan: both. So you have. 110 00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:55.749 huda: Are these for the different ones? Or are they like for the just? For one of them? This, this one is like for all the programs like you have to do this one regardless, and then this one's for like if you wanna do, the economic disparity 111 00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:03.289 huda: one. And then this one like this one down here is if you want to do the power of investing. 112 00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.789 Jenny Duan: Okay? Sounds good. So this corresponds to the power of investing. 113 00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:18.120 Jenny Duan: No, that's the economic disparity. Where is the power of invest? Oh, this, this one's the power of investing one. No, no. 114 00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.570 Jenny Duan: okay. 115 00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.259 Jenny Duan: In the past 4 decades. Okay, I feel like right here. 116 00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.050 Jenny Duan: This sentence, I think this transition needs to be reworked cause I feel like 117 00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.329 Jenny Duan: I love this. I love the rest. The transition between the 2 does unquote 118 00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.359 Jenny Duan: work for me. 119 00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:53.839 huda: yeah, I didn't really know how to like, go about this essay, cause I don't know if we like supposed to highlight, like like leadership qualities or like. 120 00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:59.539 huda: reflective more, so like, I, kind of went towards like leadership. 121 00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.510 huda: Yeah. 122 00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:07.530 Jenny Duan: okay, i'm just reading mine, and 123 00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.039 Jenny Duan: my essay is like, not good. 124 00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.160 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'll show you mine. 125 00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:28.869 Jenny Duan: I don't know like this is not like II was trying to see if I could get some like insight for your essay. But I don't think this is like like looking back at this. This is not really a good essay, so I wouldn't really like take inspiration from mine. 126 00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:37.449 Jenny Duan: But I think maybe one thing is, they might want you to sound like sound informed or sound smart about what you want to do. So I was using a lot of like 127 00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:44.830 Jenny Duan: big words. But oh, okay. I also talk about like systemic racism. 128 00:21:45.360 --> 00:22:05.690 Jenny Duan: Hmm, okay, that could be interesting. And then for this community one, I really want him on the culture. I feel like you can do that, too, if you want. Because Notre Dame, just for context, like Notre Dame is not a diverse school. It's like, mostly, why, obviously, it's like mostly Catholic. It's not diverse. And so I think they really want like. 129 00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:14.139 Jenny Duan: oh, okay, they, I think they would really care about culture. It's even in programs, leadership seminar on. So 130 00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:25.359 Jenny Duan: I think this one like. I don't think this is a good essay, too, but this one I like really, went Ham on, like the cold, like dialing in the culture. I think that might have been helpful. Okay. 131 00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:33.090 Jenny Duan: mine really different. I feel like mine's like more I think usually I don't think my sisters are good. I wouldn't like. 132 00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:37.349 Jenny Duan: I think I probably got in because I had like good test scores. 133 00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:42.220 Jenny Duan: but I don't even know if they ask for your test scores. So I don't even think, still. 134 00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:49.779 Jenny Duan: okay? Well, I don't think my essays like, I don't think my essays were good. I think yours can be much better. 135 00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.910 Jenny Duan: okay, let's first decide which one you plan to apply to. I think that will help us. Which one are you more interested in? 136 00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:06.370 huda: I feel like this. this like disparity, one about economic disparity. I think that one like alliance would like 137 00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.930 huda: like my projects, and, like 138 00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:31.760 huda: like my portfolio as a whole. It's also like really interesting cause, like like you. This is like what people work towards like change to these issues. Whereas, like, I know, power of investing is gonna be like a helpful tool. But I feel like, it's kinda like, really random. From what I've been doing. Yeah, I agree. I think this one would be better, too. 139 00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.700 huda: My Doick, I kind of like my essay for the other one better 140 00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:44.380 Jenny Duan: the power of investing one better. Yeah, I did not like the one that I wrote for the economic disparity. 141 00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.800 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, 1 s. 142 00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:59.689 Jenny Duan: Okay, I've been. It was my, only 143 00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.879 Jenny Duan: you get oh, I don't think I finish, I guess. 144 00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:17.340 Jenny Duan: Oh, this is like good. This is a good story, too. Hmm, hmm. hmm, okay. I see you, man. Okay. 145 00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:27.920 Jenny Duan: rewrote this essay. It might be better cause II do like this like seminar. But I think my essay is not too strong. So. 146 00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think 147 00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:47.719 Jenny Duan: I like how you're talking about folklift. But I don't think that this highlights an economic despair like I don't think that like a small business. You illustrate that I don't think that highlights an economic disparity like right off the bat. Does that make sense? So I feel like this anecdote doesn't really tie into what you're saying down here 148 00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:55.480 Jenny Duan: is what I think. So I think you can maybe change this anecdote to make your essay stronger. Do you have any other ideas about like what you might want to write about instead? 149 00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.419 huda: Maybe to highlight economic disparity. 150 00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:05.790 huda: so okay, it's still kind of like small business related. But there's like. 151 00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:32.369 huda: Okay, well, not like point fingers or anything. But there's like like a white carpenter like that. Everyone calls, and he charges like a lot and like, he's basically like invited everywhere, check the events and stuff. But then there's like a lot of South American like carpenters and in our community. And I feel like they just don't get their same recognition and same like 152 00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:51.800 Jenny Duan: economic like support as the white one. So I don't know how to like. Talk about. It's not to boot, for you talk about race because they mentioned it here like race ethnicity, geography and gender. So try to mention, like, maybe, how these issues are intersectional and also like 153 00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.119 Jenny Duan: systemic. You can say that 154 00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:06.309 Jenny Duan: like, it's okay for you to be like a little bit fake, woke, or like very partly woke in these essays, because, again, like the demographic that you're writing to, they're very much like 155 00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.039 Jenny Duan: they'll eat it up like there'll be like. 156 00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:17.049 Jenny Duan: because Notre Dame is not really diverse, right? So there, they really want to have those mindsets in their programs. 157 00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:26.150 huda: So maybe, like, instead of this, like folklift, I can talk about like I just, I don't wanna sound like vindictive towards like the white person like. 158 00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.820 huda: yeah. 159 00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:51.170 Jenny Duan: I mean, you can just mentioned. Okay, the the thing that you should like this is just in general in life to like, if you're trying to say they are white people just don't put the blame on like white people. Just say it's like the system, even though the system, like created by white people, but, like you don't like, take like, take it outwards, and don't put the blame on like an individual group, and then you'll be fine that makes sense. 160 00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:59.610 Jenny Duan: But I think it's nice that you did connect it to something that you do. So it would still be cool to talk about, maybe, how you're 161 00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:17.239 Jenny Duan: like you can stay that anecdote, and then you can at the end you can like. Maybe if you're able to tie into like how you're trying to actively reduce, like the economic barrier by empowering small businesses through folklift. But that can be more like a in a side if you want like, it doesn't have to be the main. If you don't have a story to connect it to. 162 00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:30.400 huda: I agree. Yeah, I can maybe like in my full Clift initiative, like, I mainly empower, like minority own businesses. Because they're like unheard voices. Perfect. Yeah. 163 00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:31.899 Jenny Duan: that sounds really good. 164 00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:39.680 Jenny Duan: Okay. And then this is due on the twenty-first, right? Twenty-second, yeah, 20. Second, okay, so are we gonna meet before then. 165 00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:50.049 Jenny Duan: Okay, we might meet before them. But once you finish it. Just send me a text, and I'll just look on the dock and give you feedback right away, so we don't have to wait till our next meeting, cause I know it's a bit of a yeah. 166 00:27:50.220 --> 00:28:00.869 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. Mhc, jobs is also like a good thing to write about for this, too. If you wanted more ideas, I think your idea is already good. But if you wanted more ideas, you can tie it into this. Okay. 167 00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.370 Jenny Duan: how have you made a difference in your community. Okay. 168 00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:11.840 Jenny Duan: this is good, like mentioning your background like, get like points for that. 169 00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:18.499 Jenny Duan: as what you would describe your alcoholic. This was the largest loss he had ever faced. 170 00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:24.230 Jenny Duan: like my dad were severely shoveled in the 171 00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.620 Jenny Duan: okay. 172 00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.240 Jenny Duan: unlike 173 00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.180 Jenny Duan: who came to. 174 00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.230 Jenny Duan: Oh. 175 00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.629 huda: maybe like vote leaders started dodging. 176 00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:51.229 Jenny Duan: I think this paragraph, like, can be condensed. I think this is be more concise. 177 00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.170 He doesn't know anyone. You're nobody. 178 00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.319 Jenny Duan: Yeah. This is good. 179 00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.130 Jenny Duan: Yes, yes. 180 00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:12.580 Jenny Duan: and website data to those in need. Okay, 181 00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.799 Jenny Duan: this is really good. I really like that. Thank you. 182 00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.030 Jenny Duan: Okay. 183 00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:32.169 Jenny Duan: love inclusivity and activism. How does this uphold the values of love, inclusivity and activism. 184 00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.030 huda: I think inclusivity. 185 00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.399 Jenny Duan: I mean, like 186 00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:56.510 huda: II think it's like kind of more that, like the entire community shows inclusivity. So like, even if the jobless like, like the people that lost their jobs during the crisis, I think it was like kind of working to include them in like 187 00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:57.550 huda: like 188 00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:04.839 huda: through job opportunities. But I mean, like, I see what you mean like. I think it's not really directed towards one of 189 00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:13.149 huda: like love inclusion or activism. But I think it most kinda it's like shows inclusion. 190 00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think activism is also displayed here. 191 00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:28.139 Jenny Duan: let's see. Oh, also. Do you have an option anywhere to provide further information to the admissions community? 192 00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.660 huda: Does it give you like 100 words extra at the end. Let me check. 193 00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.730 Jenny Duan: Okay. 194 00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.999 huda: yeah, there's a additional information section with 100 words. 195 00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:10.539 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's good to know. Systematic committee was severely disheveled in late 2022. 196 00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.619 Jenny Duan: I watched as the 197 00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:19.979 Jenny Duan: fun's joyful uncles, who came to every gathering later, started. 198 00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.750 Jenny Duan: Judging them to him for jobs. 199 00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.680 Jenny Duan: It 200 00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:39.530 Jenny Duan: it came to sads reality that many of them that many of them face seemingly without solution. 201 00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.450 Jenny Duan: You, Chairman Cube. 202 00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:53.859 Jenny Duan: create a change again, scribbling on a 203 00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.010 Jenny Duan: shabby whiteboard 204 00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.800 Jenny Duan: with with the probably 205 00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.630 Jenny Duan: with his or your hence 206 00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.099 Jenny Duan: it is probably handwriting. 207 00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:17.490 Jenny Duan: And so and when you don't know anybody, you're nobody. 208 00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.870 Jenny Duan: and that's when I struggled okay. how many words does this essay allowed to have 300 209 00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:35.870 Jenny Duan: move over on your face? I'm going. Some probably provided contacts to their employers while the website projected to those in need for what I got a job 210 00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.680 Jenny Duan: learned, the and the impact community can make the other. 211 00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:49.900 Jenny Duan: Today I learned that nobody's can make changes for anyone. That's great. save. 212 00:32:50.420 --> 00:33:18.269 Jenny Duan: Okay, you have like 100 words. Okay, I think maybe I will like I didn't really answer the question of how it upholds the values of Notre Dame. So maybe I can like, go into detail after that. Let's see he doesn't know anybody, and when you don't know anybody or nobody, maybe here, let's hammer in like this is the sad reality for many or something like about how 213 00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.670 Jenny Duan: like during times of like existing. 214 00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.270 Jenny Duan: Okay? Maybe you say, like already, marginalize. 215 00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:35.749 Jenny Duan: this is just my rough notes, like, I would write this in your own words. But already marginalized communities are greater affected in times of 216 00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.290 Jenny Duan: like change, or in times of like 217 00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:40.880 Jenny Duan: and 218 00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.310 Jenny Duan: economic 219 00:33:43.610 --> 00:34:03.900 Jenny Duan: conflict, or something like that, like, do you know what I'm saying. Like existing marginalized. These are greater, are greater affected during times of like uncertainty. And this includes, like, you know, obviously, the Muslim community or immigrant communities, or women, or queer folks, or whatever you know, etcetera. But 220 00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.970 Jenny Duan: I think I would just add, like a sentence here to just 221 00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.820 Jenny Duan: dial that in, and then 222 00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:13.750 Jenny Duan: not nobody's can make changes for every everybody. And then. 223 00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.040 Jenny Duan: with love, inclusivity, you can say, like 224 00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.519 Jenny Duan: through empathy and 225 00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.949 Jenny Duan: discernment for others, or something like that. Like I 226 00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:33.840 Jenny Duan: use, like my like, coding, talent. voice, whatever ability skills 227 00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:45.500 Jenny Duan: to impact change in my community. And you can say, like. by upholding 228 00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:52.480 Jenny Duan: these values I strive to become a more impactful 229 00:34:52.670 --> 00:35:03.349 Jenny Duan: leader or a more powerful leader, or a more yeah, more compactful, too. create change. I started to become a more and helpful like 230 00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.860 Jenny Duan: compassionate leader, or something 231 00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.170 Jenny Duan: something like that. I would just add this to the end. 232 00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:16.160 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so is there anything I need to like, emphasize to like 233 00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.689 huda: that, like Notre Dame really looks for 234 00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:40.069 Jenny Duan: I think, just these, these models, these values of love, inclusivity and activism, and like using your gifts to help others. That's like something like Catholicism generally emphasizes like using your talents or your skills to help others. And maybe you can say something about like how you know that in the future that you wanna continue doing this, and whatever form it takes, or whatever 235 00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.550 huda: sounds good. 236 00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:53.590 Jenny Duan: awesome. So I think the plan for this. The rest of this essay should be like you add these parts. Edit this first essay, and then just send me a text when you're done, and I'll go back onto your document to take a look at that. 237 00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:01.719 Jenny Duan: okay, I think everything else looks really good for the rest of the application. Do you need your activities, or what other components are we missing? 238 00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:10.490 huda: So let me just check again. activities. 239 00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:19.819 huda: I don't think there's a section. Oh, yeah, there is. There is. I put in filmmakers, club folklift. 240 00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.710 huda: cynthoria. 241 00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:29.289 huda: my social media. Page but I don't really know if I should put that 242 00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:35.720 huda: And are you asking? Like all I put so far. 243 00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.260 huda: I think I could put NC. Witt right? 244 00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.749 Jenny Duan: Exactly. That's good. Yeah. 245 00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.950 huda: I don't. Should I keep like the social media pages that, too. Like weak. 246 00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.430 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's week. I think it's fine. Yeah. 247 00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.490 huda: okay. 248 00:36:51.640 --> 00:37:01.350 huda: and then I also, I don't know what to put it under, cause. It could be like community service. Clubs, drama, employment. 249 00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.490 huda: Let me share my screen. Actually. 250 00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:05.890 okay, cool 251 00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.950 Jenny Duan: and recorded. Yeah. 252 00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.970 huda: hmm. 253 00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.719 Jenny Duan: I would maybe say, instead of social media page, I would just say, like. 254 00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:32.630 Jenny Duan: if you can spin it in a different way, like educational advocacy. Yeah, page. 255 00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:40.290 Jenny Duan: yeah. Platform, educational advocacy platform. 256 00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.709 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's good. 257 00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.999 Jenny Duan: And then you are like the founder, too. Don't don't discount that 258 00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.560 Jenny Duan: of the in of the Instagram. Yeah. 259 00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.790 huda: So just about founders. 260 00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you can say that Creator founders something like that. 261 00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.489 huda: there's just based off of the news? 262 00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:12.760 huda: yeah. And and would it be like a program? 263 00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.080 Jenny Duan: That would be? There'll be an award. 264 00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:30.509 Jenny Duan: Is there an award? Oh, you can just put that in a note like you. You see how you have, like special recognition or awards received. You could say that, for like you can say and see with for the award. 265 00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.660 Jenny Duan: because I don't think it's like an activity. I think it's more just an award. Oh. 266 00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:41.300 Jenny Duan: I see what you mean, do you have any other computer sciency related things that you can put 267 00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:53.879 Jenny Duan: activity? Yeah, like anything else. Like, maybe you can see like developers, something like that. You can put. Yeah, okay, yeah. Related to that. 268 00:38:55.150 --> 00:39:03.330 huda: and 269 00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.729 huda: there's a kind of some designs. 270 00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:13.270 huda: but 271 00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.880 huda: maybe national. 272 00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:23.189 Jenny Duan: And then I could. Yeah. And then you can put that.

It's kind of it's community service, I think. 280 00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.560 huda: and 281 00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:46.369 Jenny Duan: I guess, since we got like connection from Florida Green National. 282 00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:48.050 huda: And 283 00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.640 Jenny Duan: would I be able to put this for that tour? 284 00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.599 huda: Just put it for one. 285 00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:03.040 Jenny Duan: I would just put it for one. Yeah, yeah, it's okay. If you don't have a recognition tied to it. Like, that's fine, too? 286 00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:04.210 huda: Okay. 287 00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.280 Jenny Duan: right? 288 00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.599 huda: Oh, you could also put your volunteering at your church, like that would count 289 00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.820 huda: okay. 290 00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.149 Jenny Duan: and would this prefer Sunday school to you? 291 00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.950 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 292 00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:47.130 huda: maybe like 293 00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.020 Jenny Duan: hirsch. 294 00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.239 huda: yeah, just like, 295 00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.390 huda: almost, yeah. 296 00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.450 huda: yeah, let me try to think of anything else I've done. 297 00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:12.969 huda: Do you think I could like, even though it doesn't have that much impact like, do you think I could put the discord group on me, because, like, I don't really know how these people? 298 00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.949 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's fine. Are you in the Honors society? 299 00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.750 huda: No. 300 00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.950 Jenny Duan: Are you planning to join National Honor society. 301 00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:25.499 huda: Like for that, like, the applications are like, really early on in the year. 302 00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.800 huda: And 303 00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:27.860 huda: yeah. 304 00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.010 huda: what other than. okay. 305 00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.450 huda: whoops. 306 00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:00.590 Jenny Duan: international, actually as well. 307 00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:06.340 huda: I think. Is that good enough for activities? Or should I put 2 more? 308 00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.580 Jenny Duan: I think that's good enough. Is there anything else that you feel like is missing 309 00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:24.690 huda: I don't think so. 310 00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.599 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think you are good. 311 00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:39.660 huda: Yeah. Do you think I should? I think I I don't know if you have an option. If you could put your test scores or not. But 312 00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:50.910 Jenny Duan: they're not required, but they're strongly encouraged. 313 00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:52.910 huda: so like, 314 00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.800 Jenny Duan: yours. It's okay. 315 00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:56.660 huda: Hmm! 316 00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.940 Jenny Duan: Go ahead. 317 00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:10.759 huda: Do you think I should put my score because it isn't that high? But it's like it says it's highly encouraged. So remind me what your score. 318 00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:12.430 huda: I was 1440, 319 00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:20.970 Jenny Duan: 1440. Let me look at Notre Dame's another day. Common data set. 320 00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.660 Jenny Duan: Let me just look at their common data set really quickly. 321 00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:49.060 Jenny Duan: 7, 10 can remind me, one more time. What? Yours is. 322 00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.130 huda: 1440, 323 00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:56.700 Jenny Duan: 1440 for SAT, yeah. okay. 324 00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:11.289 Jenny Duan: okay, you definitely have a low test score for them. But it's not 325 00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:17.250 Jenny Duan: egregiously low. But it is low. What's your fiance's boardroom? 326 00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:18.939 huda: 1420, 327 00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.210 Jenny Duan: 1420. Okay. 328 00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:23.750 Jenny Duan: Your piercings were not bad. 329 00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:27.169 Jenny Duan: like, I think 330 00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.410 Jenny Duan: if they are strongly encouraging it, then I think you should just submit it. Okay. 331 00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:47.070 huda: Yeah, I'll submit that then? other than that, I think. Make sure you fill out the additional comments. Section, yeah. Oh, what do you think I should put on here? 332 00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:52.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah, when I did it, I wrote like. 333 00:45:52.700 --> 00:46:04.910 Jenny Duan: how you're really, really interested in studying economic disparity and how? You're highly okay. Let me just call you paste. I think mine's like very similar to what you can write. You can just 334 00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.700 Jenny Duan: edit a little bit to make it personalized. I just put it in the chat. 335 00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:11.950 huda: Okay. 336 00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:18.169 Jenny Duan: just like, talk about your interest. And like how you really really want to do this. 337 00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:28.750 Jenny Duan: I think you can just modify my statement and just make it like, just rewrite in your own words. And that should be fine. 338 00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.110 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 339 00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:32.210 huda: yeah, thank you. 340 00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:40.619 huda: yeah, I think. I just wish my test. Scores are higher, I think hopefully, this next 341 00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:43.019 huda: this next test, I can get a higher score. 342 00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:49.789 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I use, I think, like to do to drastically improve your score. You have to study like 343 00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:58.189 Jenny Duan: pretty much every single day. Do you feel like you have enough resources to do that? Given the new format, and that there's not really much of a precedent for it right now. 344 00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:22.890 huda: I think there's definitely a lot less like reliable like study material, because I've I took like 2 modules of like a practices. But there's like, only like 4 practices that only take it all at once. But like, yeah, I did test that meeting. It's like, definitely a lot easier than the normal sat. But like, there'll be a trickier curve. 345 00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:31.840 huda: Be aware of, yeah, yeah, but I just, I feel like there's not as many resources for the digital set. So 346 00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:40.060 huda: I'm kind of struggling on finding like practice tests for that, like, I know, there's like there's 4 on Khan Academy. But I feel like this, not enough like I want to do more. 347 00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:45.339 Jenny Duan: So I would say, spend at least one day like sitting down 348 00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:52.249 Jenny Duan: and like doing everything doing it all on one all at once. 349 00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:53.330 huda: Okay. 350 00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:56.510 Jenny Duan: yeah. Let me just look on Reddit, if there's any 351 00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.280 Jenny Duan: I think. 352 00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.130 Jenny Duan: Okay. 353 00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.810 Jenny Duan: therefore, not if 354 00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.339 Jenny Duan: so, there's Khan Academy's. And then there's also they released 355 00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:23.369 Jenny Duan: So it's people say, the content on the digital test is pretty much the same. 356 00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:42.629 Jenny Duan: but it's like a little bit easier. So just keep on practicing with normal sat content, too, and you should be fine, cool. Well, this sounds good, so just let me know when you're done with a Notre Dame essays, and I'll review those for you. But the next time we're gonna meet is gonna be on Saturday. 357 00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.009 Jenny Duan: But let me know if you need anything before that, just text me, and we can work it out. 358 00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.850 huda: Okay, thank you. Yeah, bye.",

How's it going? 2 00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.210 huda: Hi! It's going. Well, how are you? 3 00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:54.490 Jenny Duan: I'm going well, too. awesome. Well, it's nice to see you again. Were you? How's everything going? Actually, yeah. 4 00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.139 huda: it's going. Well, 5 00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:09.290 huda: yeah, we're still like, kind of locking in our course selections. And I'm still kind of like in a dilemma. If I should take a peek lit or not, cause I just I don't wanna like fail miserably. So. 6 00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.470 huda: yeah, yeah. 7 00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.749 Jenny Duan: yeah. Sign up, are you? Is it possible for me to change? 8 00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.070 huda: you can change until like August first, I believe. 9 00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.650 Jenny Duan: is that after like, can you change after school starts? No. 10 00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.790 hmm. 11 00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:41.130 Jenny Duan: So like you don't. You're not allowed to change like. let's say, if you don't, Link Ap. Let you can't switch out of it once. Cost starts 12 00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:55.040 huda: I think, like this year. They didn't do this last year, but this year they allowed each drop like ap courses for flex period, or normal class. But I don't. I don't know if I could still do that 13 00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.850 Jenny Duan: next year. Would they let you go? Would you like? Would they let you go back to the honors? 14 00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.710 huda: I can ask my counsellor, but I don't think that was the case this year. 15 00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:16.379 Jenny Duan: Wait. Can you ask your counselor? Because if you're able to go back to the honors, then it's then it's easy. You just sign up for Ap lit. But if not historically, what have your English grade",
    "s been? 16 00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:29.039 huda: Well, I've had like an 8 throughout high school, but like I know, literature is like a lot of like reading and analyzing. And I'm kind of better at writing than reading. So. 17 00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.680 Jenny Duan: okay, do you know what the apulete teacher's like, because 18 00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.599 ap Latin High School was my favorite class, like it was. It was like my favorite high school class like 19 00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:47.200 Jenny Duan: ever, even though I'm not really a writer, but like I love that class because I had a great teacher. So I think, do you know what your teachers like? 20 00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:57.439 huda: I heard she was strict. But like, I mean, like, usually, I have like a good relationship with my English teachers, because, like, I kind of buttered them up. But yeah. 21 00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.110 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel like you shouldn't be scared. And I think you should go with Ap. Lit. But 22 00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.379 Jenny Duan: do you like? Do you think that you won't survive if you do, if you lit. 23 00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:22.650 huda: I'm just like considering cause like like I know 5 ap is like, might be a lot for me to handle but at the same time I feel like if I just like kind of work hard these 2 semesters. 24 00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.250 huda: It might be better for me. So I think I'm just gonna go forward with Ap lit. 25 00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:51.370 Jenny Duan: I think you should talk to your teacher and see if you're able to drop down to the honors if Ap. Lit doesn't work out, but I think, regardless you should just send out for Ap. Lit. Because, remember this, in your senior year you don't have to take any ap test at the end of the year, like in May. If you don't want to take the test, you don't have to also maintain your grades for maximum one semester. If that at all. Like best case, you get into your early decision school, Usc, and then you're done. 26 0",
    "0:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.610 huda: But like. 27 00:07:53.290 --> 00:08:10.010 huda: Oh, yeah, I had a question about Usc, I was actually like looking up like the kind of statistics on how people get accepted. And I think the and I think the acceptance rate for usc. Was higher during regular decision than early decision. 28 00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.790 Jenny Duan: Oh, really, that's interesting. Let me look it up. So good. 29 00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:25.849 Jenny Duan: It's actually a good Good point. Okay? So you're gonna see a 12.5%. La, la, let's see 30 00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.189 Jenny Duan: here, let's see. 31 00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:51.210 Jenny Duan: is it crimson website? So I'm not sure. No, because on this 32 00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.460 Jenny Duan: early action 33 00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.490 Oh, I don't think there's actually early decision. Early action is great. 34 00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:06.270 Jenny Duan: Early action is non binding and non restrictive. Okay, that's perfect. 35 00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.100 Jenny Duan: Well, okay, that's good. 36 00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:20.580 Jenny Duan: and you'll also be considered for us to see merit scholarships. Okay, that's also good. See? They say we estimate that 20 to 25% of our admissions base will be granted during the Ea. 37 00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:29.209 Jenny Duan: So I mean, that doesn't mean that the acceptance rates 2025%. That just means that they're filling like a fifth to a quarter of their spots. 38 00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.390 Jenny Duan: Okay? Well, I think you should just apply earlier, anyways, because 39 00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:43.250 Jenny Duan: because it'll put you in eligibility for their merit scholarships, which I think would be just be like good in general. 40 00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:55.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Given that Usc is let me just write this on Usc is early action given that Usc is early action. Do you want to early decision any. Would you have any early decision schools? 41 00:0",
    "9:56.220 --> 00:09:59.000 huda: I think. Maybe, like Stanford 42 00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:12.320 Jenny Duan: Stanford is also rest. San Francis. Restrictive early action, which means. If you apply to Stanford, you can't apply for Usc in the early action round. But that's also like that's also like fine, though, cause you could just apply for Usc 43 00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.250 Jenny Duan: regular decision, I guess. 44 00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.899 huda: Yeah. Hmm. 45 00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:23.530 huda: I think I'd rather apply to Usc early action because 46 00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.190 huda: I don't know, like I feel like 47 00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:38.840 huda: Stanford early act, I mean, like regular decision for Usc. Might not be the best, just as you said, like getting like the merit scholarship. I'd be qualified. So 48 00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.369 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think it's a better choice policy. I don't know if it 49 00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.000 Jenny Duan: I don't know if it 50 00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.629 Jenny Duan: is it? 51 00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.730 Jenny Duan: You may not? Yeah, you might not apply to any 52 00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.899 Jenny Duan: other private college under their early action. Restrictive early action early as an early notification. 53 00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:22.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So you can't apply to any, you see, wouldn't be able to apply to Usc. If you applied to Stanford. So I think that you know I think it would be best to apply for Usc early action. That way you can do the merit scholarships, and then you can just apply for Stanford in the regular decision round. But hopefully you won't have to do that because you'll get into Usc, actually, if you get to Usc, will you still want to apply for other schools? Or do you think you'll be like done after that? 54 00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:37.299 huda: I think I'd wanna share for Stanford, because obviously, I kinda prioritize. I just, I kinda like, realize how important it is",
    " to be like closer to home. So I think, like, yeah, definitely, I'm gonna still try for Stanford. 55 00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:44.339 Jenny Duan: Okay? So like, then, Stanford, be like your second choice school, and Usc would be your number one school, you would say. 56 00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:54.479 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, cool. So then Usc, first, and then all this Ucs, and then Stanford and everything else will be regular decision. Okay, that makes sense to me. 57 00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:18.090 Jenny Duan: Awesome. Okay. How's everything else going with AI, everything else. Yeah. So an update on Santori, I think I posted it and an Indie game developers group and Linkedin, and that was like able to get like a lot of engagement, and like also like a lot of phase from that so like, I think that was like. 58 00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:29.650 huda: kinda I'm glad that kind of happened. And I also did connect with like a lot of like game developers. In the industry already. And I've like, been chatting with them. 59 00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:35.230 huda: And then I think, right now, I have like 150 plays on my game. 60 00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:45.529 huda: yeah. And I also like an update. So game, women and games. It was like, I found that this group. I think it's 61 00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:55.459 huda: it was like a discord, like. I think it's like larger than discord. But like they have like conferences and speaker events and stuff. 62 00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:17.230 huda: And so it's kinda like trying to figure out how I can become an app ambassador and so like they didn't really specify like the age requirements. So then I went in the discord, and I've been asking so like, they're trying to reach to the like coordinator to see if she'll let me. But yeah, like I'm trying to clean my case. But yeah, I think you definitely can. That'd be great. 63 00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:30.760 Jenny Duan: You should also connect with women and games like just the professional mentors like, are there m",
    "entors or people that can maybe help you like publish your game or like, give your game more reach or amplify that in any way. 64 00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:50.450 huda: Yeah, I think, like, there's like a lot of like industry already. And I can like definitely connect to them and like, ask them, like on their tips on how they like publicize their games cause there are like a lot of indie game developers as well. And I've already like connected to a few, but I can like ask them now. 65 00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.209 Jenny Duan: Awesome. What would be the responsibility of an ambassador if you became one? 66 00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:11.069 huda: So I have to like kind of take control of their social media for some time and then like, create content for them. Sometimes. And then I'd have to participate in like the virtual meetings. 67 00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:27.029 huda: Well, I'm gonna pull it up. But there's like only a few that's good that aligns with the rest like this stuff that you're already doing to? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I also to bring something up so like my friend. She was doing like this like. 68 00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:46.150 huda: biomed kind of like card. It's like, it's like a nonprofit trying to spread awareness about cardiovascular like diseases and stuff. And she asked me to be like like secretary, or like publicity of the nonprofit. And like basically take charge of the social media. 69 00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:58.729 huda: I said, yes for now, but like I don't. I'm not really putting too much time into it. But II think just like having that rule like, do you recommend like putting more effort into it or 70 00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.110 huda: do you think it doesn't align? 71 00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.439 Jenny Duan: I think it doesn't really align like is health related right? And I feel like, you know. 72 00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So II didn't really wanna do it. But 73 00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:18.009 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm just like kinda jus",
    "t doing it to help her out. But yeah, you could maybe, like, refer someone else you might be interested in helping to instead of you doing it. 74 00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.830 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's like not worth your time. 75 00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:28.309 huda: I agree. Let me find, like the the women and games responsibility actually 76 00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.740 here and again. 77 00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.249 huda: Oh, yeah. And I also like. 78 00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:52.389 huda: I started writing like, my Notre Dame essays, but I don't really like them. So maybe you could go over them and it tell me unlike what I can change. 79 00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.919 Awesome. Yeah. 80 00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.389 Jenny Duan: How is comparing Vi and folklift going? 81 00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:16.500 huda: Yeah. So it's not too many updates on that. But I did connect with my vice President and the stem sisters is the person that we're collaborating with, and I don't know if I told you this already, but we set a date for the event, which is the fifteenth? 82 00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:24.669 huda: I think I did tell you this. But yeah, I think we're gonna like start getting more technical. I think we need to set up a call. But 83 00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.689 huda: yeah, that's like, kind of all. We didn't get much progress for that 84 00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.820 Jenny Duan: boy. No worries. That sounds good. 85 00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:50.300 Jenny Duan: that's okay, let me just look back and see. I wanna finish up this like your activities. Sort of going backwards on that oh, for the service award thing. I think for the turn up activism thing. Are you able to basically like, create your own project within that? Is it really flexible? 86 00:16:51.090 --> 00:17:00.849 huda: I think so like, I think, like, I don't know, because they haven't really gotten back yet. 87 00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.849 huda: but yeah, it's like, kind of more activism oriented and 88 00:17:06.069 --",
    "> 00:17:14.210 huda: I think it's like, if you get involved with like activities in your area. let me double check, though. 89 00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:29.740 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! Because, like, there's a chance with those types of things if you're able to. Well, also, thanks for studying that, I think about the ambassadors. I think so. Back to the turn up to something. If you're able to self direct, you can just count all the hours you work for like empowering a I folklift, and just like. 90 00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.849 Jenny Duan: put those in for the award. 91 00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.680 huda: Yeah, I think the school provides that awards. So 92 00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.120 huda: I don't know if they'll allow it. But yeah. 93 00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.600 Jenny Duan: okay, because I think that that could be like a good thing to to try. 94 00:17:46.720 --> 00:18:11.009 Jenny Duan: cool, I think. Oh, another random thing is, I sent you like a bay area creative foundation thing. I think you can apply for this award. If you'd like to. You can submit like a film that you've already done, or I think you might qualify for. Oh, never mind. Submissions are now close. Okay. I wanted to open again. 95 00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.530 Jenny Duan: Okay. 96 00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.969 Jenny Duan: to December thirteenth. Okay, never mind, then. 97 00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.159 Jenny Duan: But next year. If you wanna submit, you could submit like your 98 00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.990 Jenny Duan: visual art. I think you can probably submit like games like I feel like that would be fine for visual art, or you could submit. Fill. 99 00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:37.600 Jenny Duan: Okay. But I guess that is close now. So that's okay. Okay, anyways, let's talk about your Notre Dame essays. Now. 100 00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.720 Jenny Duan: So these are your rough drafts. Right? 101 00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:50.749 huda: Okay? I kind of for the first one, I kind of like use the one from bank ",
    "of America and kind of like changed it. So it fit the question. 102 00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:57.679 Jenny Duan: In the past 4 decades the United States has experienced an unprecedented rise. Are there viable solutions. 103 00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.869 Jenny Duan: Okay. the power of investing is actually the one that I did. So let me. 104 00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.030 Jenny Duan: let's get my essays. 105 00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:23.210 huda: Yes, okay. I was actually like, I was considering whether I should do the power of investing or the American like disparity one. And I actually have, like 106 00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.859 huda: I have look a 107 00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.709 huda: rough draft for that one as well. So 108 00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.589 Jenny Duan: okay. When I did it, the questions were like, much different. 109 00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.619 Jenny Duan: both. So you have. 110 00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:55.749 huda: Are these for the different ones? Or are they like for the just? For one of them? This, this one is like for all the programs like you have to do this one regardless, and then this one's for like if you wanna do, the economic disparity 111 00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:03.289 huda: one. And then this one like this one down here is if you want to do the power of investing. 112 00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.789 Jenny Duan: Okay? Sounds good. So this corresponds to the power of investing. 113 00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:18.120 Jenny Duan: No, that's the economic disparity. Where is the power of invest? Oh, this, this one's the power of investing one. No, no. 114 00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.570 Jenny Duan: okay. 115 00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.259 Jenny Duan: In the past 4 decades. Okay, I feel like right here. 116 00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.050 Jenny Duan: This sentence, I think this transition needs to be reworked cause I feel like 117 00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.329 Jenny Duan: I love this. I love the rest. The transition between the 2 does unquote 118 00:20:36.620 -",
    "-> 00:20:38.359 Jenny Duan: work for me. 119 00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:53.839 huda: yeah, I didn't really know how to like, go about this essay, cause I don't know if we like supposed to highlight, like like leadership qualities or like. 120 00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:59.539 huda: reflective more, so like, I, kind of went towards like leadership. 121 00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.510 huda: Yeah. 122 00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:07.530 Jenny Duan: okay, i'm just reading mine, and 123 00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.039 Jenny Duan: my essay is like, not good. 124 00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.160 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'll show you mine. 125 00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:28.869 Jenny Duan: I don't know like this is not like II was trying to see if I could get some like insight for your essay. But I don't think this is like like looking back at this. This is not really a good essay, so I wouldn't really like take inspiration from mine. 126 00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:37.449 Jenny Duan: But I think maybe one thing is, they might want you to sound like sound informed or sound smart about what you want to do. So I was using a lot of like 127 00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:44.830 Jenny Duan: big words. But oh, okay. I also talk about like systemic racism. 128 00:21:45.360 --> 00:22:05.690 Jenny Duan: Hmm, okay, that could be interesting. And then for this community one, I really want him on the culture. I feel like you can do that, too, if you want. Because Notre Dame, just for context, like Notre Dame is not a diverse school. It's like, mostly, why, obviously, it's like mostly Catholic. It's not diverse. And so I think they really want like. 129 00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:14.139 Jenny Duan: oh, okay, they, I think they would really care about culture. It's even in programs, leadership seminar on. So 130 00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:25.359 Jenny Duan: I think this one like. I don't think this is a good essay, too, but this one I like really, went Ham on, like the cold, like dialing in the culture. I think that might have been helpfu",
    "l. Okay. 131 00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:33.090 Jenny Duan: mine really different. I feel like mine's like more I think usually I don't think my sisters are good. I wouldn't like. 132 00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:37.349 Jenny Duan: I think I probably got in because I had like good test scores. 133 00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:42.220 Jenny Duan: but I don't even know if they ask for your test scores. So I don't even think, still. 134 00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:49.779 Jenny Duan: okay? Well, I don't think my essays like, I don't think my essays were good. I think yours can be much better. 135 00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.910 Jenny Duan: okay, let's first decide which one you plan to apply to. I think that will help us. Which one are you more interested in? 136 00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:06.370 huda: I feel like this. this like disparity, one about economic disparity. I think that one like alliance would like 137 00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.930 huda: like my projects, and, like 138 00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:31.760 huda: like my portfolio as a whole. It's also like really interesting cause, like like you. This is like what people work towards like change to these issues. Whereas, like, I know, power of investing is gonna be like a helpful tool. But I feel like, it's kinda like, really random. From what I've been doing. Yeah, I agree. I think this one would be better, too. 139 00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.700 huda: My Doick, I kind of like my essay for the other one better 140 00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:44.380 Jenny Duan: the power of investing one better. Yeah, I did not like the one that I wrote for the economic disparity. 141 00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.800 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, 1 s. 142 00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:59.689 Jenny Duan: Okay, I've been. It was my, only 143 00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.879 Jenny Duan: you get oh, I don't think I finish, I guess. 144 00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:17.340 Jenny Duan: Oh, this is like good. This is a good story, too. Hmm, hmm. hmm, okay. I see you, man. Okay. 145 00:24:17.820 -->",
    " 00:24:27.920 Jenny Duan: rewrote this essay. It might be better cause II do like this like seminar. But I think my essay is not too strong. So. 146 00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think 147 00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:47.719 Jenny Duan: I like how you're talking about folklift. But I don't think that this highlights an economic despair like I don't think that like a small business. You illustrate that I don't think that highlights an economic disparity like right off the bat. Does that make sense? So I feel like this anecdote doesn't really tie into what you're saying down here 148 00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:55.480 Jenny Duan: is what I think. So I think you can maybe change this anecdote to make your essay stronger. Do you have any other ideas about like what you might want to write about instead? 149 00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.419 huda: Maybe to highlight economic disparity. 150 00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:05.790 huda: so okay, it's still kind of like small business related. But there's like. 151 00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:32.369 huda: Okay, well, not like point fingers or anything. But there's like like a white carpenter like that. Everyone calls, and he charges like a lot and like, he's basically like invited everywhere, check the events and stuff. But then there's like a lot of South American like carpenters and in our community. And I feel like they just don't get their same recognition and same like 152 00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:51.800 Jenny Duan: economic like support as the white one. So I don't know how to like. Talk about. It's not to boot, for you talk about race because they mentioned it here like race ethnicity, geography and gender. So try to mention, like, maybe, how these issues are intersectional and also like 153 00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.119 Jenny Duan: systemic. You can say that 154 00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:06.309 Jenny Duan: like, it's okay for you to be like a little bit fake, woke, or like very partly woke in these essays, because, again, like the",
    " demographic that you're writing to, they're very much like 155 00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.039 Jenny Duan: they'll eat it up like there'll be like. 156 00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:17.049 Jenny Duan: because Notre Dame is not really diverse, right? So there, they really want to have those mindsets in their programs. 157 00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:26.150 huda: So maybe, like, instead of this, like folklift, I can talk about like I just, I don't wanna sound like vindictive towards like the white person like. 158 00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.820 huda: yeah. 159 00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:51.170 Jenny Duan: I mean, you can just mentioned. Okay, the the thing that you should like this is just in general in life to like, if you're trying to say they are white people just don't put the blame on like white people. Just say it's like the system, even though the system, like created by white people, but, like you don't like, take like, take it outwards, and don't put the blame on like an individual group, and then you'll be fine that makes sense. 160 00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:59.610 Jenny Duan: But I think it's nice that you did connect it to something that you do. So it would still be cool to talk about, maybe, how you're 161 00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:17.239 Jenny Duan: like you can stay that anecdote, and then you can at the end you can like. Maybe if you're able to tie into like how you're trying to actively reduce, like the economic barrier by empowering small businesses through folklift. But that can be more like a in a side if you want like, it doesn't have to be the main. If you don't have a story to connect it to. 162 00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:30.400 huda: I agree. Yeah, I can maybe like in my full Clift initiative, like, I mainly empower, like minority own businesses. Because they're like unheard voices. Perfect. Yeah. 163 00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:31.899 Jenny Duan: that sounds really good. 164 00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:39.680 Jenny Duan: Okay. And then this is due on the twenty-first, right? Twent",
    "y-second, yeah, 20. Second, okay, so are we gonna meet before then. 165 00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:50.049 Jenny Duan: Okay, we might meet before them. But once you finish it. Just send me a text, and I'll just look on the dock and give you feedback right away, so we don't have to wait till our next meeting, cause I know it's a bit of a yeah. 166 00:27:50.220 --> 00:28:00.869 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. Mhc, jobs is also like a good thing to write about for this, too. If you wanted more ideas, I think your idea is already good. But if you wanted more ideas, you can tie it into this. Okay. 167 00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.370 Jenny Duan: how have you made a difference in your community. Okay. 168 00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:11.840 Jenny Duan: this is good, like mentioning your background like, get like points for that. 169 00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:18.499 Jenny Duan: as what you would describe your alcoholic. This was the largest loss he had ever faced. 170 00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:24.230 Jenny Duan: like my dad were severely shoveled in the 171 00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.620 Jenny Duan: okay. 172 00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.240 Jenny Duan: unlike 173 00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.180 Jenny Duan: who came to. 174 00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.230 Jenny Duan: Oh. 175 00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.629 huda: maybe like vote leaders started dodging. 176 00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:51.229 Jenny Duan: I think this paragraph, like, can be condensed. I think this is be more concise. 177 00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.170 He doesn't know anyone. You're nobody. 178 00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.319 Jenny Duan: Yeah. This is good. 179 00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.130 Jenny Duan: Yes, yes. 180 00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:12.580 Jenny Duan: and website data to those in need. Okay, 181 00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.799 Jenny Duan: this is really good. I really like that. Thank you. 182 00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.030 Jenny Duan: Okay. 183 00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:32.169 Jenny Duan: love inclusivity and activism. How does this uphold the values of l",
    "ove, inclusivity and activism. 184 00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.030 huda: I think inclusivity. 185 00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.399 Jenny Duan: I mean, like 186 00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:56.510 huda: II think it's like kind of more that, like the entire community shows inclusivity. So like, even if the jobless like, like the people that lost their jobs during the crisis, I think it was like kind of working to include them in like 187 00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:57.550 huda: like 188 00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:04.839 huda: through job opportunities. But I mean, like, I see what you mean like. I think it's not really directed towards one of 189 00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:13.149 huda: like love inclusion or activism. But I think it most kinda it's like shows inclusion. 190 00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think activism is also displayed here. 191 00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:28.139 Jenny Duan: let's see. Oh, also. Do you have an option anywhere to provide further information to the admissions community? 192 00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.660 huda: Does it give you like 100 words extra at the end. Let me check. 193 00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.730 Jenny Duan: Okay. 194 00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.999 huda: yeah, there's a additional information section with 100 words. 195 00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:10.539 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's good to know. Systematic committee was severely disheveled in late 2022. 196 00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.619 Jenny Duan: I watched as the 197 00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:19.979 Jenny Duan: fun's joyful uncles, who came to every gathering later, started. 198 00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.750 Jenny Duan: Judging them to him for jobs. 199 00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.680 Jenny Duan: It 200 00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:39.530 Jenny Duan: it came to sads reality that many of them that many of them face seemingly without solution. 201 00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.450 Jenny Duan: You, Chairman Cube. 202 00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:53.859 Jenny Duan: create a change again, scribbling on a 203 00:31:54.3",
    "20 --> 00:31:56.010 Jenny Duan: shabby whiteboard 204 00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.800 Jenny Duan: with with the probably 205 00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.630 Jenny Duan: with his or your hence 206 00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.099 Jenny Duan: it is probably handwriting. 207 00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:17.490 Jenny Duan: And so and when you don't know anybody, you're nobody. 208 00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.870 Jenny Duan: and that's when I struggled okay. how many words does this essay allowed to have 300 209 00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:35.870 Jenny Duan: move over on your face? I'm going. Some probably provided contacts to their employers while the website projected to those in need for what I got a job 210 00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.680 Jenny Duan: learned, the and the impact community can make the other. 211 00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:49.900 Jenny Duan: Today I learned that nobody's can make changes for anyone. That's great. save. 212 00:32:50.420 --> 00:33:18.269 Jenny Duan: Okay, you have like 100 words. Okay, I think maybe I will like I didn't really answer the question of how it upholds the values of Notre Dame. So maybe I can like, go into detail after that. Let's see he doesn't know anybody, and when you don't know anybody or nobody, maybe here, let's hammer in like this is the sad reality for many or something like about how 213 00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.670 Jenny Duan: like during times of like existing. 214 00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.270 Jenny Duan: Okay? Maybe you say, like already, marginalize. 215 00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:35.749 Jenny Duan: this is just my rough notes, like, I would write this in your own words. But already marginalized communities are greater affected in times of 216 00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.290 Jenny Duan: like change, or in times of like 217 00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:40.880 Jenny Duan: and 218 00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.310 Jenny Duan: economic 219 00:33:43.610 --> 00:34:03.900 Jenny Duan: conflict, or something like that, like, do you know what I'm saying. Like e",
    "xisting marginalized. These are greater, are greater affected during times of like uncertainty. And this includes, like, you know, obviously, the Muslim community or immigrant communities, or women, or queer folks, or whatever you know, etcetera. But 220 00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.970 Jenny Duan: I think I would just add, like a sentence here to just 221 00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.820 Jenny Duan: dial that in, and then 222 00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:13.750 Jenny Duan: not nobody's can make changes for every everybody. And then. 223 00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.040 Jenny Duan: with love, inclusivity, you can say, like 224 00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.519 Jenny Duan: through empathy and 225 00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.949 Jenny Duan: discernment for others, or something like that. Like I 226 00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:33.840 Jenny Duan: use, like my like, coding, talent. voice, whatever ability skills 227 00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:45.500 Jenny Duan: to impact change in my community. And you can say, like. by upholding 228 00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:52.480 Jenny Duan: these values I strive to become a more impactful 229 00:34:52.670 --> 00:35:03.349 Jenny Duan: leader or a more powerful leader, or a more yeah, more compactful, too. create change. I started to become a more and helpful like 230 00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.860 Jenny Duan: compassionate leader, or something 231 00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.170 Jenny Duan: something like that. I would just add this to the end. 232 00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:16.160 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so is there anything I need to like, emphasize to like 233 00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.689 huda: that, like Notre Dame really looks for 234 00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:40.069 Jenny Duan: I think, just these, these models, these values of love, inclusivity and activism, and like using your gifts to help others. That's like something like Catholicism generally emphasizes like using your talents or your skills to help others. And maybe you can say something about like how you know that in",
    " the future that you wanna continue doing this, and whatever form it takes, or whatever 235 00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.550 huda: sounds good. 236 00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:53.590 Jenny Duan: awesome. So I think the plan for this. The rest of this essay should be like you add these parts. Edit this first essay, and then just send me a text when you're done, and I'll go back onto your document to take a look at that. 237 00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:01.719 Jenny Duan: okay, I think everything else looks really good for the rest of the application. Do you need your activities, or what other components are we missing? 238 00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:10.490 huda: So let me just check again. activities. 239 00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:19.819 huda: I don't think there's a section. Oh, yeah, there is. There is. I put in filmmakers, club folklift. 240 00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.710 huda: cynthoria. 241 00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:29.289 huda: my social media. Page but I don't really know if I should put that 242 00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:35.720 huda: And are you asking? Like all I put so far. 243 00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.260 huda: I think I could put NC.

Like weak. 246 00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.430 Jenny Duan: I don't think it's week. I think it's fine. Yeah. 247 00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.490 huda: okay. 248 00:36:51.640 --> 00:37:01.350 huda: and then I also, I don't know what to put it under, cause. It could be like community service. Clubs, drama, employment. 249 00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.490 huda: Let me share my screen. Actually. 250 00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:05.890 okay, cool 251 00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.950 Jenny Duan: and recorded.

    "640 --> 00:37:32.630 Jenny Duan: if you can spin it in a different way, like educational advocacy. Yeah, page. 255 00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:40.290 Jenny Duan: yeah. Platform, educational advocacy platform. 256 00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.709 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's good. 257 00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.999 Jenny Duan: And then you are like the founder, too.

And and would it be like a program? 263 00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.080 Jenny Duan: That would be? There'll be an award. 264 00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:30.509 Jenny Duan: Is there an award? Oh, you can just put that in a note like you. You see how you have, like special recognition or awards received. You could say that, for like you can say and see with for the award. 265 00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.660 Jenny Duan: because I don't think it's like an activity. I think it's more just an award. Oh. 266 00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:41.300 Jenny Duan: I see what you mean, do you have any other computer sciency related things that you can put 267 00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:53.879 Jenny Duan: activity?

What's your fiance's boardroom? 326 00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:18.939 huda: 1420, 327 00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.210 Jenny Duan: 1420.

You're highly okay. Let me just call you paste. I think mine's like very similar to what you can write.

I just put it in the chat. 335 00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:11.950 huda: Okay. 336 00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:18.169 Jenny Duan: just like, talk about your interest. And like how you really really want to do this. 337 00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:28.750 Jenny Duan: I think you can just modify my statement and just make it like, just rewrite in your own words.

    " --> 00:46:49.789 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I use, I think, like to do to drastically improve your score. You have to study like 343 00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:58.189 Jenny Duan: pretty much every single day. Do you feel like you have enough resources to do that?

But there's like, only like 4 practices that only take it all at once. But like, yeah, I did test that meeting. It's like, definitely a lot easier than the normal sat. But like, there'll be a trickier curve. 345 00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:31.840 huda: Be aware of, yeah, yeah, but I just, I feel like there's not as many resources for the digital set. So 346 00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:40.060 huda: I'm kind of struggling on finding like practice tests for that, like, I know, there's like there's 4 on Khan Academy. But I feel like this, not enough like I want to do more. 347 00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:45.339 Jenny Duan: So I would say, spend at least one day like sitting down 348 00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:52.249 Jenny Duan: and like doing everything doing it all on one all at once. 349 00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:53.330 huda: Okay. 350 00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:56.510 Jenny Duan: yeah. Let me just look on Reddit, if there's any 351 00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.280 Jenny Duan: I think. 352 00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.130 Jenny Duan: Okay. 353 00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.810 Jenny Duan: therefore, not if 354 00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.339 Jenny Duan: so, there's Khan Academy's. And then there's also they released 355 00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:23.369 Jenny Duan: So it's people say, the content on the digital test is pretty much the same. 356 00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:42.629 Jenny Duan: but it's like a little bit easier. So just keep on practicing with normal sat content, too, and you should be fine, cool. Well",
    ", this sounds good, so just let me know when you're done with a Notre Dame essays, and I'll review those for you. But the next time we're gonna meet is gonna be on Saturday. 357 00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.009 Jenny Duan: But let me know if you need anything before that, just text me, and we can work it out. 358 00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.850 huda: Okay, thank you. Yeah, bye."
