That's awesome, I think. Now it's next December. It's like starting the countdown to Rea decisions or not just. But, like all your decisions starting to come out. Which is exciting, but also nerve wracking, you know. 7 00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.690 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, great. So today, I think we want to look at the mit essays. 8 00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:25.010 Jenny Duan: Do we want to start with Mit or Upenn? 9 00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.690 huda: I think we finalized the Mit essays, all of them. 10 00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.180 Jenny Duan: Okay. Wait. 11 00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.260 huda: Yeah, I actually submitted. Mit. 12 00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.709 Jenny Duan: Okay, wait. Yes, I do remember this congratulations. Then we can start with Upenn. 13 00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.139 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me open the document. Give me one second. 14 00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:54.340 huda: Yeah, I wrote 2, 2, like 2 essays, and then it was like the letter one, and then the 1st one, which is like why you penn. 15 00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.670 Jenny Duan: Okay? 16 00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.510 Jenny Duan: One second. 17 00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's start with a thank you. Note. 18 00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:24.049 Jenny Duan: Dear. Mr. Jeff Kennedy. 19 00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.340 Jenny Duan: okay, 20 00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.310 huda: I have 2 versions of this. 21 00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.480 Jenny Duan: Okay. Which one do you like better? 22 00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.490 huda: I kind of feel like the second one's more like detailed. 23 00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:53.669 Jenny Duan: Okay, I agree. I think this 1st sentence in the 1st one is a little bit uninspiring. So I think the second one is better. 24 00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.789 Jenny Duan: I like this fellow Island Hopper. 25 00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.190 huda: Yeah. 26 00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.000 Jenny Duan: I think this 1st sentence is a little long. So I'm gonna I mean the second sentence. So I'm gonna cut it here. 27 00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.891 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is good. I think we could make it a little bit more personal. 28 00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.029 Jenny Duan: and what I mean by that is. 29 00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:26.939 Jenny Duan: I think the sentence doesn't really add much. Is there a way that that you can say like something like growing up like I spent countless hours or 30 00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.240 Jenny Duan: growing up. I was one of the many kids who spent countless hours exploring 31 00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.219 Jenny Duan: XY. And Z, or like 32 00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.729 Jenny Duan: this island, or something more specific to you. 33 00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.179 Jenny Duan: And what do you mean becoming? Your life's blueprint? 34 00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:54.119 huda: Like kind of like the things that I learned from pop tropica. I kind of like 35 00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:14.199 huda: like the approach that pop tropica took, which was like having humor and having, like creativity and try, you know, exploring different like passages like, I kind of applied that in my life. And as for, like the second sentence, I was thinking, maybe I could say something like 36 00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:21.999 huda: like pop tropico is part of like my nightly routine as a kid like I'd 37 00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.879 huda: always play like part of an island before I went to sleep, or like 38 00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:32.648 huda: something like that. Maybe like I can show, like the context of, like me playing the game I was when I was younger. 39 00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that would be better. 40 00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:09.470 Jenny Duan: I wonder how we can condense these 2 sentences? Actually, hmm! 41 00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.000 Jenny Duan: Maybe like growing up playing top tropica. 42 00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:25.420 Jenny Duan: What began as just a game became my life's blueprint creativity. 43 00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.289 Jenny Duan: I think this is good enough for just the introduction. 44 00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.590 Jenny Duan: like I don't think you need to spend too much time for space introing it. 45 00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.590 huda: Okay. 46 00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.550 Jenny Duan: Became 47 00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.470 Jenny Duan: what began as just a game. 48 00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.799 Jenny Duan: If you want, you can say like what began as 49 00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:08.269 Jenny Duan: my 30 as my nightly bedtime routine, or what like you can weave in the 30 min before bed here if you want to, but you also don't need to. 50 00:11:09.717 --> 00:11:12.570 huda: I think that would sound a little better, actually. 51 00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, then, yeah, let's do that. 52 00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:53.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is a bit. This is a bit long to what began this. 53 00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.650 Jenny Duan: I still feel like the sentence is a bit wordy. 54 00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.380 huda: And. 55 00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:00.879 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think what I'm noticing in this essay is, I feel like it should be a little bit more conversational, but it feels a bit more like removed. 56 00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:09.449 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense like this is so? It is an essay. Yes, but it should feel also like just a letter that you're giving to someone else. So I think 57 00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:30.110 Jenny Duan: we can make some edits to make it sound like you're speaking directly to the person. Because, for example, like, I think if you were to send this in as an email or as an actual essay, you might change some of the language to make it feel more personal. So let's just do that right now. So keep keeping your like good diction, good vocabulary, and stuff, but just making it a little bit more personalized. 58 00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:44.309 Jenny Duan: Instead of, I vividly recall. If you were to write this to a person, you might, or one might say something like. 59 00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:48.079 Jenny Duan: I remember the 1st time I conquered Mystery Island. 60 00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.250 Jenny Duan: or I can still remember, or 61 00:13:52.706 --> 00:14:02.299 Jenny Duan: like one of my favorite memories was, or how would you write this if you were just like writing it to another person, or would you write? I vividly recall, because if you would write that, that's also fine. 62 00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.319 huda: I think, like I I still remember. Maybe. 63 00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.600 Jenny Duan: Okay? 64 00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.320 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 65 00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.470 Jenny Duan: with unadulterated excitement. Would you write this 66 00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.729 Jenny Duan: in a letter, or would you not. 67 00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.610 huda: Maybe you don't. 68 00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:40.890 Jenny Duan: How would you say it? 69 00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.809 Jenny Duan: Maybe like one of my favorite memories, or 70 00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:06.810 Jenny Duan: I feel like I still remember beating Mystery Island. I think that sounds a little bit stagnated. Is there a way we can make it? A little bit more emotion backed, or a little more excited. 71 00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.475 huda: Yeah, 72 00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.006 huda: maybe it could just be like one of my favorite islands were a mystery island where I 73 00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:28.699 huda: piece together clues clicked every possible object excitedly. 74 00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.890 huda: Maybe like one of my favorite islands are. 75 00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:35.910 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 76 00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:33.290 Jenny Duan: why was this? Why was this island your favorite, or why did it stand out to you like? Was it your 1st island? Was it the hardest island like? 77 00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.290 Jenny Duan: Is there something. 78 00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:46.529 huda: I think like in this island. There was like a lot of historical figures that we were already learning in class. It kind of made me excited to see them in like this kind of setting, like 79 00:16:46.938 --> 00:16:50.169 huda: to kind of like talk to them in the game, and then, like 80 00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.510 huda: also see them in like a playful setting. 81 00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.189 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like that's a super valuable detail. 82 00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:00.190 Jenny Duan: That maybe we can add here. 83 00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.630 Jenny Duan: like 84 00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:16.039 Jenny Duan: you can say something like, I remember coming home one day from school and playing Mystery Island, seeing the characters reflecting like 85 00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:22.799 Jenny Duan: the history lesson from that day, or I don't remember exactly what history lesson. But if you could be specific about which one that could be good 86 00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.359 Jenny Duan: on Mystery Train Island, 87 00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:10.680 Jenny Duan: Seeing cross-legged eyes glued to the screen, I pieced together. 88 00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.729 Jenny Duan: What were some of the clues? 89 00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.090 Jenny Duan: Who is this. 90 00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.599 huda: Like the missing projector. 91 00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.900 Jenny Duan: Is there anything that relates to Marie Antoinette specifically like her life or no? 92 00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:30.890 huda: I think there was like there was like a flyer, for like, Wait, hold on, let me. 93 00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.749 huda: I I don't remember. I haven't put this in a while. 94 00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.350 Jenny Duan: Look at the pub tropica wiki, or something. 95 00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.440 huda: Yeah. 96 00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.920 huda: Okay. Actually, they had. Sorry I was remembering it was Susan B. Anthony. 97 00:19:14.602 --> 00:19:18.490 huda: And she hands out like a woman suffrage pamphlet. 98 00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.760 huda: So we're just learning about that earlier. 99 00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.359 Jenny Duan: And seeing her once again on mystery. A train island 100 00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:37.860 Jenny Duan: I pieced together, I, seeing her again on seeing her 101 00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:47.800 Jenny Duan: represented on Mystery Train Island. Sitting cross-legged, eyes glued to the screen, I piece together clues on 102 00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.835 Jenny Duan: together, clues from the flyers, she 103 00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.120 Jenny Duan: from the woman suffrage flyers. She handed out. 104 00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.060 Jenny Duan: Handed out. 105 00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.470 Jenny Duan: This was my 1st time. 106 00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.480 Jenny Duan: This is like not a good sentence. I'm just writing a filler for an idea. 107 00:20:17.273 --> 00:20:19.640 Jenny Duan: This is my 1st time 108 00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:30.870 Jenny Duan: or no, I think you need like a transition, and then can say yours. 109 00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:36.429 Jenny Duan: maybe, like how many years later, 8 years later, 10 years later, 5 years later. 110 00:20:37.556 --> 00:20:38.530 huda: Like 8. 111 00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.379 Jenny Duan: Okay. 8 years later, 8 years later. 112 00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:03.299 Jenny Duan: I feel the same determination when teaching for myself. 113 00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.510 Jenny Duan: Debugging feels 114 00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.110 Jenny Duan: like just another island. 115 00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:28.259 Jenny Duan: today I am a game developer 116 00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:41.959 Jenny Duan: or pop tropica has inspired me to create my own games. 117 00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.730 huda: Maybe then I'd have to delete the next sentence. 118 00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.390 Jenny Duan: Yes. 119 00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.530 Jenny Duan: my own games teaching AI ethics 120 00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.660 Jenny Duan: and building worlds for learning and play. 121 00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:23.530 Jenny Duan: Okay. 122 00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.760 Jenny Duan: I think the structure of this is is a lot better, but I think we can edit like some of the 123 00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:38.500 Jenny Duan: like phrasing and words. But I just wanted to show this to you and see what you think about the structure, and if you don't like it, we can always go back to the old one. 124 00:22:40.155 --> 00:22:54.384 huda: I think this like paragraph, I need to somehow like connect it back to the central part of it, because, right, now I feel like it's kind of a little confusing. You wanna just starts talking about like 125 00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.470 Jenny Duan: She's okay. Yeah. 126 00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.050 huda: Yeah. 127 00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.750 Jenny Duan: I think this can be like one example of something that you played in the game. 128 00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.049 huda: Isn't it. 129 00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I don't know if you need to. 130 00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.459 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I don't know if you need to write about Season B. Anthony. You could just go back to 131 00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:21.170 Jenny Duan: one of my favorite islands was Mystery Train Island, or something just about Mystery Train Island, without Susan B. Anthony in it. 132 00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:37.489 huda: Maybe instead, I can focus on like I can keep the Susan V. Anthony part. But I can say, like, like seeing her in like my video game made me like excited to go to class the next morning pointing out the characters like, Oh, that's the girl from poptropica 133 00:23:37.859 --> 00:23:41.809 huda: so maybe like how it made me excited to learn. Maybe. 134 00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.140 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good idea. 135 00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.429 huda: This last sentence, do you think it's really necessary. 136 00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.589 Jenny Duan: No, I don't think so. 137 00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:56.950 huda: Okay. 138 00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.060 Jenny Duan: Or if you want, you can say something like 139 00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:43.109 Jenny Duan: on Mystery Island. I learned this on another island, like I remember, like that one island with like the crazy, the crazy rabbits, and and all the carapa 140 00:25:43.469 --> 00:25:43.830 Jenny Duan: like. 141 00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.139 huda: On that island I foreshare island. Yeah. 142 00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:52.739 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I learned like another skill that applies, or another trait that applies to you. That's another way. You could structure it. 143 00:25:53.608 --> 00:25:59.729 Jenny Duan: But I think, just like something a specific memory or a specific story that you have from the game could be good. 144 00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.929 huda: Would that sound like a little more essay like 145 00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.229 huda: if I did kind of like list different things, that I learned. 146 00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.940 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's just 147 00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:24.810 Jenny Duan: leave this blank, for now, if you had just had this as you're starting, and you were like writing a note to Jeff Kenney, like, just forget, outside of the context of the essay. 148 00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.870 Jenny Duan: If you're just writing, I think you know. What would you want him to know. 149 00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:37.079 huda: I just like I feel like it's really generic. But I just like want him to know that, like he kind of inspired me like what I'm 150 00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.850 huda: want to pursue in the future, because, like 151 00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:55.769 huda: I guess his games were never really just like just for fun, and that almost like when you're like hiding vegetables inside, like like Mac and cheese, or something like he just like hid education so well that. 152 00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.140 Jenny Duan: Somehow. 153 00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:03.930 huda: I just like, like I knew random history facts because of the video game.

But like, instead of writing so much about 326 00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:25.779 Jenny Duan: about Cmu, you could turn it into like 327 00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.159 Jenny Duan: how your resilience has shaped who you are. 328 00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:36.429 Jenny Duan: or you could do the Andrew Jackson like Eid essay. I think that's also a good essay for this one. 329 00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:42.569 Jenny Duan: or you can come up with a different essay altogether. Is there anything that you feel like you want to emphasize that you haven't yet. 330 00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.040 huda: I honestly think that 331 00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:52.610 huda: one of the iterations of the almond tree essay, which was like 1st I talk about like 332 00:56:53.021 --> 00:57:11.878 huda: light outages and like building websites for like small businesses. And then there's the one about. And then I talk about like the saffron example. And then I think like one of the iterations I talked about like being in like a club where, like 333 00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:18.010 huda: being like parts of like clubs that weren't really exclusive to girls, or like Muslim girls in specific 334 00:57:18.425 --> 00:57:31.954 huda: and then I started like empowering AI as kind of like a way around that. So maybe like I can use that iteration because it's kind of like focusing on how I like adapt to different 335 00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.210 huda: like scenarios. 336 00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:38.639 Jenny Duan: And how will you ensure that this is like different enough from your common app? 337 00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:45.730 huda: I don't think my comment app was really about like being 338 00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:48.979 huda: wait. I don't remember. Actually, I don't know if I. 339 00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:52.839 Jenny Duan: I don't. I don't think it's I don't think you talked about in your common app too much. 340 00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.759 huda: Yeah, I don't know if I talked about like being like excluded from like 341 00:57:58.503 --> 00:58:01.816 huda: like clubs. I don't think I mentioned 342 00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:04.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I don't think so. 343 00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:11.169 huda: Yeah, so I could like make it different by focusing on that aspect. 344 00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:16.429 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And you said I, I didn't catch which essay did you say you're gonna adapt it from. 345 00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.420 Jenny Duan: Or is this a new essay? 346 00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:24.100 huda: It's the same like elementary essay, but it was 347 00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.090 huda: I don't know. It was one of the different iterations of it. Let me check. 348 00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:32.380 Jenny Duan: You have it saved somewhere. 349 00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:37.299 huda: Yeah, probably it's probably one of the essays I already submitted. 350 00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:37.820 Jenny Duan: Okay. 351 00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.849 huda: Oh, yeah, this was like, part of like the Usc viterbi. 352 00:58:52.435 --> 00:58:54.760 huda: Okay, essay me. 353 00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.889 Jenny Duan: Can you copy? Paste it into here. 354 00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.760 huda: Yes. 355 00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:00.870 Jenny Duan: Okay? Great. 356 00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.540 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is good. 357 00:59:06.892 --> 00:59:11.690 Jenny Duan: How many words is this? 300 words already? Or is it 2? 50? Looks like, oh, 200. 358 00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:15.310 huda: Okay, yeah, this is just part of that one. 359 00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:18.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah, make this a little bit longer. 360 00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:24.919 Jenny Duan: This is who I am in improvising innovator. Then you have an opportunity to add, and additional anecdote here. 361 00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.570 huda: Like before the tech clips. Part. 362 00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.970 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 363 00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:42.099 Jenny Duan: Or maybe after, like, you can talk more about empowering AI here. 364 00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:44.010 huda: Yeah. 365 00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.850 Jenny Duan: 100 words. Is not that much more? It's like a couple of sentences. 366 00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:53.150 huda: Yeah, I think I think like 367 00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:57.880 huda: just going in like, further about like empowering AI might be better. 368 00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.229 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it sounds good. 369 01:00:00.933 --> 01:00:07.249 Jenny Duan: And then how do you define a successful college experience? What are your thoughts on this question? Do you have any ideas so far. 370 01:00:08.723 --> 01:00:16.820 huda: I think, like knowing as many people as possible. I think like that's like the best thing that you can get out of college because 371 01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:22.100 huda: I feel like that. The whole use of college is like the people that you meet. 372 01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:31.669 huda: whether it's like professors or like your peers, I think, like having like growing a network at college. I think that's like the most important part, but 373 01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:38.930 huda: also, like, specifically, I think, another aspect that makes like the college experience successful is like. 374 01:00:39.376 --> 01:00:43.120 huda: kind of adopting new skills, like, for example, like 375 01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:55.149 huda: I kind of stopped reading since like because of school. But if I go to college, and I start learning how to like love reading again, maybe like that might be like something that I pick up 376 01:00:55.642 --> 01:00:59.869 huda: so just like learning new aspects. Not just like information. 377 01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:06.630 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Let's see. 378 01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.860 Jenny Duan: is there like an anecdote or something that you want to write here like a a format. 379 01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:43.840 huda: Maybe I can talk about like my like going into high school. What I thought like a successful high school experience was. And like. Maybe that can contrast like now what I think. That would be like a good college experience, because like, I started off high school pretty shy. So I didn't really think that like networking was that important. And then now that I'm like going to college, now that I realize that it's like it's what I'm looking most forward to. 380 01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a good idea. 381 01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:54.289 Jenny Duan: Oh, so can you verbalize? What do you think a successful college experience looks like for you? 382 01:01:55.302 --> 01:02:01.079 huda: A successful college experience would look like meeting as many people as possible. 383 01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:04.200 huda: Like growing a network and 384 01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.339 huda: like learning new interests in college. 385 01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.154 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 386 01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:18.669 Jenny Duan: And then maybe like having, like pushing yourself to have as many new experiences as possible. 387 01:02:20.016 --> 01:02:23.720 Jenny Duan: And then maybe you can say like 388 01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:44.959 Jenny Duan: the process of learning you can talk about like how you see learning like, obviously, learning is super important to you. So I feel you can draw on like teaching, tutoring and other aspects of learning, and compare, like, how you see how you've seen the people that you've worked with and helped learn, and how that impacts like the way that you want to learn 389 01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:55.489 Jenny Duan: and like learning in different forms, like, you can say, like, learning doesn't just come from the classroom. It comes from like these clubs that you join, and like your conversations with your peers and teachers and other things. 390 01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:02.159 huda: Yeah, so is this where I would like mention like clubs, I would join here. 391 01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.630 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think so. 392 01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:19.180 Jenny Duan: But I don't think you need to make this like super super cmu specific like, it shouldn't be as Cmu specific as like a Ycmu. But you can definitely, and you should name drop at least a couple of things. But don't make it too much about like 393 01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.909 Jenny Duan: Cmu. Talk more about what you want in general, too. 394 01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:24.660 huda: Yeah. 395 01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:42.909 Jenny Duan: Do you have any questions about this essay? 396 01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.350 huda: No. 397 01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Do you feel prepared for to write this? Or do you have any other questions. 398 01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:56.450 huda: No, I think I think that's pretty good for now. 399 01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:58.099 Jenny Duan: Okay. Amazing. 400 01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:04.880 Jenny Duan: Great. Is there anything else that you wanted to go over or review. 401 01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:23.290 huda: no, but I think like later on this week, if I if I come up with any new ideas, for, like the thank you. Note, I think I might write like a different draft after I have, like the other essays, ready. Just in case I can think of something like a little better than. 402 01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.010 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I agree. I think, that the 403 01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:33.990 Jenny Duan: key with the thank, you know, is, it's good now. But I feel like it could be a little bit more personal, or it could feel like a little bit more exciting. Yeah. 404 01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.590 huda: Hmm. 405 01:04:36.223 --> 01:04:37.790 Jenny Duan: But yeah. 406 01:04:38.535 --> 01:04:44.209 Jenny Duan: when did you want to meet next to review and finalize the Upenn and also start reviewing Cmu. 407 01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:48.039 huda: Is Thursday. Good. 408 01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:53.790 Jenny Duan: Yeah, Thursday is good. Is there a time on Thursday that works best. 409 01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.969 huda: 8 o'clock, maybe. 410 01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:00.790 Jenny Duan: Would you be able to do 411 01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:04.150 Jenny Duan: a little bit later? Maybe, like 9. 412 01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:05.790 huda: Yeah. 413 01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:06.630 Jenny Duan: I'll show you guys. 414 01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:07.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 415 01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.600 Jenny Duan: Sounds good.

That's awesome, I think. Now it's next December. It's like starting the countdown to Rea decisions or not just. But, like all your decisions starting to come out. Which is exciting, but also nerve wracking, you know. 7 00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.690 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, great. So today, I think we want to look at the mit essays. 8 00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:25.010 Jenny Duan: Do we want to start with Mit or Upenn? 9 00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.690 huda: I think we finalized the Mit essays, all of them. 10 00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.180 Jenny Duan: Okay. Wait. 11 00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.260 huda: Yeah, I actually submitted. Mit. 12 00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.709 Jenny Duan: Okay, wait. Yes, I do remember this congratulations. Then we can start with Upenn. 13 00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.139 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me open the document. Give me one second. 14 00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:54.340 huda: Yeah, I wrote 2, 2, like 2 essays, and then it was like the letter one, and then the 1st one, which is like why you penn. 15 00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.670 Jenny Duan: Okay? 16 00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.510 Jenny Duan: One second. 17 00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's start with a thank you. Note. 18 00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:24.049 Jenny Duan: Dear. Mr. Jeff Kennedy. 19 00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.340 Jenny Duan: okay, 20 00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.310 huda: I have 2 versions of this. 21 00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.480 Jenny Duan: Okay. Which one do yo",
    "u like better? 22 00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.490 huda: I kind of feel like the second one's more like detailed. 23 00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:53.669 Jenny Duan: Okay, I agree. I think this 1st sentence in the 1st one is a little bit uninspiring. So I think the second one is better. 24 00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.789 Jenny Duan: I like this fellow Island Hopper. 25 00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.190 huda: Yeah. 26 00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.000 Jenny Duan: I think this 1st sentence is a little long. So I'm gonna I mean the second sentence. So I'm gonna cut it here. 27 00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.891 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is good. I think we could make it a little bit more personal. 28 00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.029 Jenny Duan: and what I mean by that is. 29 00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:26.939 Jenny Duan: I think the sentence doesn't really add much. Is there a way that that you can say like something like growing up like I spent countless hours or 30 00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.240 Jenny Duan: growing up. I was one of the many kids who spent countless hours exploring 31 00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.219 Jenny Duan: XY. And Z, or like 32 00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.729 Jenny Duan: this island, or something more specific to you. 33 00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.179 Jenny Duan: And what do you mean becoming? Your life's blueprint? 34 00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:54.119 huda: Like kind of like the things that I learned from pop tropica. I kind of like 35 00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:14.199 huda: like the approach that pop tropica took, which was like having humor and having, like creativity and try, you know, exploring different like passages like, I kind of applied that in my life. And as for, like the second sentence, I was thinking, maybe I could say something like 36 00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:21.999 huda: like pop tropico is part of like my nightly routine as a kid like I'd 37 00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.879 huda: always play like part of an island before I went to sleep, or like 38 00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:32",
    ".648 huda: something like that. Maybe like I can show, like the context of, like me playing the game I was when I was younger. 39 00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that would be better. 40 00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:09.470 Jenny Duan: I wonder how we can condense these 2 sentences? Actually, hmm! 41 00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.000 Jenny Duan: Maybe like growing up playing top tropica. 42 00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:25.420 Jenny Duan: What began as just a game became my life's blueprint creativity. 43 00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.289 Jenny Duan: I think this is good enough for just the introduction. 44 00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.590 Jenny Duan: like I don't think you need to spend too much time for space introing it. 45 00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.590 huda: Okay. 46 00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.550 Jenny Duan: Became 47 00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.470 Jenny Duan: what began as just a game. 48 00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.799 Jenny Duan: If you want, you can say like what began as 49 00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:08.269 Jenny Duan: my 30 as my nightly bedtime routine, or what like you can weave in the 30 min before bed here if you want to, but you also don't need to. 50 00:11:09.717 --> 00:11:12.570 huda: I think that would sound a little better, actually. 51 00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.659 Jenny Duan: Okay, then, yeah, let's do that. 52 00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:53.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is a bit. This is a bit long to what began this. 53 00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.650 Jenny Duan: I still feel like the sentence is a bit wordy. 54 00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.380 huda: And. 55 00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:00.879 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think what I'm noticing in this essay is, I feel like it should be a little bit more conversational, but it feels a bit more like removed. 56 00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:09.449 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense like this is so? It is an essay. Yes, but it should feel also like just a letter that you're giving to someone else. So I think 57 00:13:09.630 --> 00",
    ":13:30.110 Jenny Duan: we can make some edits to make it sound like you're speaking directly to the person. Because, for example, like, I think if you were to send this in as an email or as an actual essay, you might change some of the language to make it feel more personal. So let's just do that right now.

U.S.A. 322 00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.269 Jenny Duan: I think for this one. You just use the almond trees one. 323 00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:08.909 huda: This is Ycmu. 324 00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:12.939 Jenny Duan: It's like, it's kind of like, Ycmu. It's like, what else 325 00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:22.369 Jenny Duan: haven't you had the opportunity to share? I think the almond trees essay? It would be good. But like, instead of writing so much about 326 00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:25.779 Jenny Duan: about Cmu, you could turn it into like 327 00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.159 Jenny Duan: how your resilience has shaped who you are. 328 00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:36.429 Jenny Duan: or you could do the Andrew Jackson like Eid essay. I think that's also a good essay for this one. 329 00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:42.569 Jenny Duan: or you can come up with a different essay altogether. Is there anything that you feel like you want to emphasize that you haven't yet. 330 00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.040 huda: I honestly think that 331 00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:52.610 huda: one of the iterations of the almond tree essay, which was like 1st I talk about like 332 00:56:53.021 --> 00:57:11.878 huda: light outages and like building websites for like small businesses. And then th",
    "ere's the one about. And then I talk about like the saffron example. And then I think like one of the iterations I talked about like being in like a club where, like 333 00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:18.010 huda: being like parts of like clubs that weren't really exclusive to girls, or like Muslim girls in specific 334 00:57:18.425 --> 00:57:31.954 huda: and then I started like empowering AI as kind of like a way around that. So maybe like I can use that iteration because it's kind of like focusing on how I like adapt to different 335 00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.210 huda: like scenarios. 336 00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:38.639 Jenny Duan: And how will you ensure that this is like different enough from your common app? 337 00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:45.730 huda: I don't think my comment app was really about like being 338 00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:48.979 huda: wait. I don't remember. Actually, I don't know if I. 339 00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:52.839 Jenny Duan: I don't. I don't think it's I don't think you talked about in your common app too much. 340 00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.759 huda: Yeah, I don't know if I talked about like being like excluded from like 341 00:57:58.503 --> 00:58:01.816 huda: like clubs. I don't think I mentioned 342 00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:04.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I don't think so. 343 00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:11.169 huda: Yeah, so I could like make it different by focusing on that aspect. 344 00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:16.429 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And you said I, I didn't catch which essay did you say you're gonna adapt it from. 345 00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.420 Jenny Duan: Or is this a new essay? 346 00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:24.100 huda: It's the same like elementary essay, but it was 347 00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.090 huda: I don't know.

But if I go to college, and I start learning how to like love reading again, maybe like that might be like something that I pick up 376 01:00:55.642 --> 01:00:59.869 huda: so just like learning new aspects. Not just like information. 377 01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:06.630 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Let's see. 378 01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.860 Jenny Duan: is there like an anecdote or something that you want to write here like a a format. 379 01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:43.840 huda: Maybe I can talk about like my like going into high school. What I thought like a successful high school experience was. And like. Maybe that can contrast like now what I think. That would be like a good college experience, because like, I started off high school pretty shy. So I didn't really think that like networking was that important. And then now that I'm like going to college, now that I realize that it's like it's what I'm looking most forward to. 380 01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.609 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a good idea. 381 01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:54.289 Jenny Duan: Oh, so can you verbalize? What do you think a successful college experience looks like for you? 382 01:01:55.302 --> 01:02:01.079 huda: A successful college experience would look like meeting as many people as possible. 383 01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:04.200 huda: Like growing a network and 384 01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.339 huda: like learning new interests in college. ",
    "385 01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.154 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 386 01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:18.669 Jenny Duan: And then maybe like having, like pushing yourself to have as many new experiences as possible. 387 01:02:20.016 --> 01:02:23.720 Jenny Duan: And then maybe you can say like 388 01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:44.959 Jenny Duan: the process of learning you can talk about like how you see learning like, obviously, learning is super important to you. So I feel you can draw on like teaching, tutoring and other aspects of learning, and compare, like, how you see how you've seen the people that you've worked with and helped learn, and how that impacts like the way that you want to learn 389 01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:55.489 Jenny Duan: and like learning in different forms, like, you can say, like, learning doesn't just come from the classroom. It comes from like these clubs that you join, and like your conversations with your peers and teachers and other things. 390 01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:02.159 huda: Yeah, so is this where I would like mention like clubs, I would join here. 391 01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.630 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think so. 392 01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:19.180 Jenny Duan: But I don't think you need to make this like super super cmu specific like, it shouldn't be as Cmu specific as like a Ycmu. But you can definitely, and you should name drop at least a couple of things. But don't make it too much about like 393 01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.909 Jenny Duan: Cmu. Talk more about what you want in general, too. 394 01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:24.660 huda: Yeah. 395 01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:42.909 Jenny Duan: Do you have any questions about this essay? 396 01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.350 huda: No. 397 01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.700 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Do you feel prepared for to write this? Or do you have any other questions. 398 01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:56.450 huda: No, I think I think that's pretty good for now. 399 01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:58.099 Jenny Duan: Okay. Amazing. 400 01:04:00.030 -->",
    " 01:04:04.880 Jenny Duan: Great. Is there anything else that you wanted to go over or review. 401 01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:23.290 huda: no, but I think like later on this week, if I if I come up with any new ideas, for, like the thank you. Note, I think I might write like a different draft after I have, like the other essays, ready. Just in case I can think of something like a little better than. 402 01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.010 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I agree. I think, that the 403 01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:33.990 Jenny Duan: key with the thank, you know, is, it's good now. But I feel like it could be a little bit more personal, or it could feel like a little bit more exciting. Yeah. 404 01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.590 huda: Hmm. 405 01:04:36.223 --> 01:04:37.790 Jenny Duan: But yeah. 406 01:04:38.535 --> 01:04:44.209 Jenny Duan: when did you want to meet next to review and finalize the Upenn and also start reviewing Cmu. 407 01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:48.039 huda: Is Thursday. Good. 408 01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:53.790 Jenny Duan: Yeah, Thursday is good. Is there a time on Thursday that works best. 409 01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.969 huda: 8 o'clock, maybe. 410 01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:00.790 Jenny Duan: Would you be able to do 411 01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:04.150 Jenny Duan: a little bit later? Maybe, like 9. 412 01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:05.790 huda: Yeah. 413 01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:06.630 Jenny Duan: I'll show you guys. 414 01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:07.620 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 415 01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.600 Jenny Duan: Sounds good.
