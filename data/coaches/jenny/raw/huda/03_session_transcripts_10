How's it going? 3 00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.639 sameeha siraj: I'm good. How are you? 4 00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:18.250 Jenny Duan: I'm good as well. It's good to see you, I think. Let's just get started. let me share my screen and you can just start with some of your updates if you have any 5 00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:27.099 sameeha siraj: so we were able to get someone to develop or like, start developing our website, or like the technology executive. 6 00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:54.459 sameeha siraj: Yeah, she's like, she says she's working on something else right now, like with another nonprofit. But we told her like, we're not gonna place all our bets on her, because if she's busy with something else, and like she doesn't end up doing it. Then she'll just like have a leadership role for no reason. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna ask her, like, if you can build a website in like one month, then we'll give you the rule. 7 00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:04.589 sameeha siraj: I should agree to it. So yeah, it's we're gonna try like developing it on our own to see like in case she doesn't do it. But yeah. 8 00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.999 Jenny Duan: oh, I feel like. That's a pretty reasonable benchmark, so if she can't develop it, then do you have some one that you have in mind for a back up? 9 00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.469 sameeha siraj: No. So I might just like start developing it on my own, maybe 10 00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.489 Jenny Duan: awesome. And how's it going with the curriculum development? 11 00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:33.709 sameeha siraj: We weren't able to make like slideshows or anything. We're actually gonna meet tomorrow after school to talk about it. But yeah. 12 00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:42.420 sameeha siraj: and for folklift I have 2 calls after this and we're gonna talk about like 13 00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.510 sameeha siraj: like when to set up our meeting and stuff. And yeah. 14 00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:59.950 Jenny Duan: yay, that's so awesome. And is there someone that's going to help you film? Or how do you envision this sewing process to go? Are you going to bring a tripod or during the actual filming. Who's going to help you? Film? 15 00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:29.409 sameeha siraj: Yeah. So my friend, she's a freshman in college right now, and she's doing film. And I propose this to her, and she agreed. She said. Just like, let me know when you wanna film and she has camera equipment. And so do I. So we're gonna bring so before we actually go to film, we're gonna make like a document for each one. And then we're gonna like plan like questions. We're gonna ask them some shots that we want for their thing. And also. 16 00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:41.349 sameeha siraj: I think during the calls, I wanna like kind of ask them what they envision for their ad and like what they really want from us. So yeah, we're gonna do a planning on the dock, and then 17 00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:48.089 sameeha siraj: when they like the time that they agreed to, we're gonna go and meet and try to film on one day. 18 00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.930 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. 19 00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.190 Jenny Duan: Cool. 20 00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.360 Jenny Duan: So the next thing is. 21 00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:03.050 Jenny Duan: how's the SAT going? Actually, you haven't had a chance to take another one. Right? Yeah. 22 00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:12.439 Jenny Duan: Okay. So folklift. Seems like it's going well. So they have 2 calls set up, and then the other 5. You're gonna set up, maybe, like later this week or next week 23 00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:18.810 Jenny Duan: cool. And then for your Youtube channel, were you able to get that unity game tutorial up? 24 00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:37.600 sameeha siraj: I'm a bit behind on like the Youtube. Yeah, I think the problem is, I thought I had like the editing software on this computer. But I think I don't have anymore. So I might have to try to transfer it to my other computer. So yeah. 25 00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.539 Jenny Duan: is it, do you need that exact software? Or would it be possible to do different software. 26 00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:50.019 sameeha siraj: I could use any software. I just feel like I'm I've been using this one. So maybe 27 00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.659 sameeha siraj: I mean, I could use any. But yeah. 28 00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.620 Jenny Duan: okay, cause I feel like. 29 00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:15.450 Jenny Duan: if we're trying to remove road blocks, if you're if it's just like a software issue, then if it blocks you for like the rest of the week. Then I would say, just download another software if you're not able to get it transferred. But if you're able to give transferred, or if you're just able to use the other computer, then I would just go with that instead. If that's a major blocker for you. 30 00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:22.289 Jenny Duan: Cool. So transfer. I'm not a different software group. 31 00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:38.320 Jenny Duan: Okay, today, I'm just doing like a quick check in. I don't. I'm not trying to spend too much time on the actual check, in part because I want to get into Thecwit application. So I just want to go through everything sort of touching face and then going to the application. 32 00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.000 Jenny Duan: So how's film club going? 33 00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:47.250 sameeha siraj: We're gonna hold our first meeting this week and we're gonna 34 00:10:47.300 --> 00:11:13.039 sameeha siraj: first start off by like a signing rules. I guess cause we'll have like actors, editors, filmers and script writers and such. So we kind of wanna keep people involved early. So after that, we're gonna ask them like, for first, short film, what genre do you guys wanna make it? And then my officers, we're thinking of like 35 00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:27.819 sameeha siraj: writing the script ourselves. Cause a lot of the people get disinterested in that phase. So we wanna try writing it by ourselves. But we needed, like the genre that they're interested in making first. So that's where we're gonna 36 00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.740 sameeha siraj: try to get the meeting out first. 37 00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.350 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 38 00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:42.979 Jenny Duan: So I realized I forgot to give you tasks from last week. I feel like you still made good progress. But I'm just going to put that down here. This week, just in case. 39 00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.720 Jenny Duan: So I would say, for empowering AI, maybe 40 00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.539 Jenny Duan: start it first, let's show. 41 00:11:53.830 --> 00:12:01.179 Jenny Duan: or actually just finish first slideshow. I would say the slide shows can be about 40 slides. 42 00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:14.119 Jenny Duan: and this will give you the flexibility to talk for either like 30 or 60 min depending on how long you want to make each session. But I think about 40, like decent slides, is a good benchmark. 43 00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:42.990 sameeha siraj: Feel obviously feel free to have more or less depending on how the curriculum actually plays out. But yeah, do you feel like finishing? One slideshow this week is realistic. Or do you feel like that's too much of a rush? I think we could actually tomorrow, like when me and my like the Co. Founder when we sit down and we like, do the meeting. I think we can just make those 40 make any changes like if we need to throughout the week. But I think we could like, basically like. 44 00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.910 sameeha siraj: make it tomorrow. 45 00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.689 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then Youtube channel. 46 00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.670 Jenny Duan: Okay. 47 00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.600 Jenny Duan: let's see, how's the Congressional app challenge going? 48 00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:18.800 sameeha siraj: Yeah. So it's like, not many updates since the last time. But yeah, I think we're starting to plan out like our like color scheme that we wanna go with and like kind of where we want to go with like the features and stuff. 49 00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.880 sameeha siraj: So we really wanna add, like 50 00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.129 sameeha siraj: something unique. Also, like I reached out to 51 00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:46.109 sameeha siraj: I think she graduated like 2 years ago. Someone from our school who won the Congressional app challenge, and I asked her. She has like any tips on, like making a project that's like worthy of getting a win and she gave some tips, saying that like it should have like an impact and try to explain like every single little feature. So, yeah. 52 00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.270 Jenny Duan: that's awesome. 53 00:13:48.670 --> 00:14:02.130 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I think again, like having something that has an impact is also good, like something that's tangible. I know someone who won it in the past. And she hers was like creating a network for sexual soul survivors. 54 00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:21.080 Jenny Duan: And that was really cool, like she actually got her up on the app store and then she like went to Columbia, and graduated from Columbia. So that's like pretty cool. You can. I'm actually gonna show her her. I'm gonna show you her Instagram, because she also kind of has, like a more professional Instagram. 55 00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.500 Jenny Duan: so 56 00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.309 Jenny Duan: you can see what it puts, what her app is like. 57 00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.890 Jenny Duan: one moment. 58 00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.629 Jenny Duan: She is also a code with classy scholar. This is a programme that you should apply for later. 59 00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:59.799 Jenny Duan: But I'll bring it up. The application's not open until like December, so I'll bring it up then. But this is her National Women's Day, because it's classy. I'm trying to find her app. 60 00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.940 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is her winning pickup prize. 61 00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:12.209 Jenny Duan: Oh, here's her app readawn app. It's on the app store now, which is pretty cool. 62 00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.350 Jenny Duan: So this could be you, too. That's not cool. 63 00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.270 Jenny Duan: Anyways. So okay, I think. 64 00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.900 Jenny Duan: oh, the last thing is the video game project. Do you have an update on that? 65 00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:34.270 sameeha siraj: Yeah. So I implemented like a lot of features this time. I was trying to like before. I wasn't sure but 66 00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:55.710 sameeha siraj: like I wanted to seen where, like the like. The older sister. She was like following the characters. So then they could go to the lab. I was able to implement the feature that she, like gets the animations when she's following her around. And I started writing the dialogue for like when they discovered the problem. So like 67 00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:12.529 sameeha siraj: when they're like in the older sister's dorm, and then they're like, Oh, I can't believe what's happening. Let's go to the lab to see if we could talk to like one of the professors. And then like. Then they walk there, and that's when the animation plays out 68 00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.160 Jenny Duan: cool. 69 00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.589 Jenny Duan: And then what is your goal. Do you have a goal for the video game project for next week? 70 00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.770 sameeha siraj: I would say. 71 00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.620 sameeha siraj: Maybe like solidify the dialogue 72 00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.380 sameeha siraj: and like. 73 00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.099 sameeha siraj: I guess. 74 00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:41.310 sameeha siraj: make like start, like making like the environment for the like. The regression model scene. I think I've been working on it for some time. But 75 00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.349 sameeha siraj: I need to like come up with the art as well. So 76 00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:58.619 Jenny Duan: got it. all right. That sounds good. So I wanted to redirect our the rest of our time and our attention to the NCWI. T. Application, were you able to email them and get in? 77 00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.809 sameeha siraj: Actually, I tried it on my other gmail, and then I was able to sign up there. 78 00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:09.520 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, that's perfect. Can you share your screen? Thanks. And 79 00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.390 sameeha siraj: okay, 80 00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.580 sameeha siraj: okay? 81 00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.730 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 82 00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:04.820 Jenny Duan: oh, also make sure you request consent from your parents.

But I think that's all for. Now 138 00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.779 Jenny Duan: let me yeah. 139 00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:43.230 Jenny Duan: think really quickly. Do you do anything else that's technology or computing, related? 140 00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.070 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 141 00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.289 Jenny Duan: we can leave it for now, and we can always add, add to it later. 142 00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's see, let's see. 144 00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.520 Jenny Duan: memory. Are you a part of any of these girls who code? Yep. 145 00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.990 Jenny Duan: I think anything else you can say hot club. 146 00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.540 Jenny Duan: That's fine scroll down 147 00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.320 Jenny Duan: hack club robotics, urine, robotics, or I did vex robotics before. 148 00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:23.340 Jenny Duan: Yep. 149 00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:42.140 sameeha siraj: I'm joining the National Honor society at my school so. 150 00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.210 sameeha siraj: or the National Technical Honor Society. 151 00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.740 sameeha siraj: But I didn't get in yet, but 152 00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.040 Jenny Duan: we go back to it. Anything else. You can also press other press, mother. 153 00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.070 Jenny Duan: And are you part of any other youth program? 154 00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:07.980 Jenny Duan: I mean, like a Congressional actually put Congressional app challenge. These are doing that. 155 00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.869 sameeha siraj: Oh, yeah, no, no scroll up. 156 00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:15.589 Jenny Duan: no scroll up. It's it's on the list. There you go. Yeah. Anything else 157 00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:24.860 sameeha siraj: you can unclick other. If there's nothing else I've done like, hackathons for def for like MLA. Checks. 158 00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.630 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. Say that, Emily. 159 00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.650 Jenny Duan: or just put Major leak hacking. 160 00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:37.539 Jenny Duan: Okay, just write the acronym cause cause your viewer might not know what that is. 161 00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:40.760 Okay. 162 00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:56.990 Jenny Duan: After this. It. After this session, I just want you to go to the link I put in the chat. And I'm also gonna put this in the document to just go and sign up for a hack club like, just just on the website, just press, join our community like, and then you'll be a part of hack club. 163 00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.590 Jenny Duan: Okay. 164 00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.420 Jenny Duan: and 165 00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.950 Jenny Duan: and then. 166 00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.049 Jenny Duan: okay, you say 167 00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.520 Jenny Duan: you should say, 168 00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.290 Jenny Duan: applies to me. Cause sometimes you have slow Internet. 169 00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:29.660 Jenny Duan: No. Access to working does not apply. You have a working computer. Yeah, no tech technology 170 00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.290 Jenny Duan: does not apply. 171 00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:37.600 Jenny Duan: Skoda, does your, does your school give you a computer? If not, you should say, Apply 172 00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.019 sameeha siraj: we have chromebooks. Okay? 173 00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:55.110 Jenny Duan: Does not? And then other barriers. Okay, here, this section. You need to write as many barriers as you can, because they they actually give you a ranking based on how, like how many barriers you've overcome. So 174 00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:00.760 Jenny Duan: yeah, I will try to think about anything that you can think about and try to put it in the barrier section. 175 00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:20.540 sameeha siraj: Maybe we could talk about like when I was trying to sign up for like computer science as a freshman, I wasn't able to, because like, almost everyone wanted to do that, and they weren't able to offer me a spot. Would that really be 176 00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.240 Jenny Duan: and scroll down? 177 00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:35.740 Jenny Duan: Okay, say, we'd scroll up. Let's say, the technic computing or technology classes. Notice what I get. 178 00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:42.190 Jenny Duan: So like for the question that says, no computing or technology classes. 179 00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:44.259 Jenny Duan: Do you see that one? 180 00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.250 sameeha siraj: Oh, there's something. 181 00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.350 Jenny Duan: Yes, I'm not sure 182 00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.699 Jenny Duan: or actually no, because you do know. 183 00:28:52.370 --> 00:29:11.809 sameeha siraj: I say, say that it's really difficult to get into computing classes at your school, which is like true. Because I could talk about like I'm able to finish the computer science like pathway at my school, although I wasn't able to like I wasn't able to take it before. 184 00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:26.380 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you can say, like, there's a very limited number of computer science classes which makes it really difficult to take which makes it difficult to access them. So yeah, there's a very limited amount of 185 00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.859 Jenny Duan: computer science classes. Courses. Yeah. 186 00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.500 sameeha siraj: whatever you want, and spots offered, and spots for those classes 187 00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.759 Jenny Duan: like, there's a first, a limited number of classes. Second, there's a limited number of spots. 188 00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and spots offered. 189 00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:59.699 Jenny Duan: you don't have to say to to you at your school. You can just say offert comma then you can finish the rest like, which makes it difficult, or which makes it nearly impossible to get into classes, or something like that 190 00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.000 Jenny Duan: in your words. 191 00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.909 sameeha siraj: Okay. 192 00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.170 sameeha siraj: alright. 193 00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.710 Jenny Duan: 2 2, 194 00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.379 Jenny Duan: take them, or to enroll, or something 195 00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.900 sameeha siraj: nice courses 196 00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:21.319 sameeha siraj: or actually to finish the pathway, maybe. 197 00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.009 Jenny Duan: or to just to take classes to take the classes 198 00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.229 sameeha siraj: should not describe like, how I overcame them or 199 00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.290 Jenny Duan: no. Okay. 200 00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:42.509 Jenny Duan: they're just right now. They're just scoring you, based on your barriers, not how you overcame them. That's a different section. Ok, what other barriers do you have? 201 00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.810 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 202 00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:52.289 sameeha siraj: I guess there's like kinda like a misrepresentation in some of the clubs. 203 00:30:52.340 --> 00:31:01.330 sameeha siraj: I don't know if that like accounts, but like in Hackathon Club, like the officers are all kind of just boys and 204 00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:11.629 sameeha siraj: I like. I feel like there's no girl representation on the officers or in the club cause. There's like, only like a handful and the entire club. There's like 300 members so 205 00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.250 Jenny Duan: well, you can say There's also 206 00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:38.899 Jenny Duan: a significant gender disparity in clubs which makes it difficult to join, for example. which makes it difficult to access. For example, in the Hackathon Club, which has over 300 members, there are only a handful, so less than 5 girls 207 00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:51.510 Jenny Duan: say, access instead of participate 208 00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.169 Jenny Duan: which makes and say that makes them difficult to access. 209 00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:09.879 Jenny Duan: for example, should be a new sentence. pick a period. And then, for example. 210 00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:39.770 Jenny Duan: yeah. And Bea only has around 5 girls. It'd be better for Burbage. Okay, that sounds like a good response. Is there anything else that you can think of 211 00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.619 again like any barriers you can think of? 212 00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:56.119 Jenny Duan: Or do you have chromebooks like? Can you only use chromebooks at school like how to stop work. or did you take it home? You could use any of you could like bring it home as well? 213 00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.190 sameeha siraj: But 214 00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.460 sameeha siraj: I'd say, like, does this have to be like technological barriers or 215 00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.379 Jenny Duan: yeah technology barriers? 216 00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:13.959 Jenny Duan: If if not, then then it's okay. You can be done. With this question, if there's anything else, though, that you can think about. 217 00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.309 Jenny Duan: So be a good time. 218 00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:23.359 sameeha siraj: I think that's all. I think I'll think about this more. 219 00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:32.409 Jenny Duan: okay, sounds good because they do score you on like, how? How many barriers that you've overcome? 220 00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.850 sameeha siraj: Okay, 221 00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:43.460 Jenny Duan: all right, just press. Continue to save it. The 222 00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.090 Jenny Duan: okay. And now 223 00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.510 Jenny Duan: I think now you're on additional information. 224 00:33:52.660 --> 00:34:06.619 Jenny Duan: Is English. Say no. If it's not, if if you've spoken another language before, what's your first language? Write that or do. Okay, perfect. And then this, yeah, this, you have to just say what the truth. 225 00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.639 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I continue. 226 00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:15.130 Jenny Duan: And then, oh, the terms and conditions you can just sign it. Now it's fine. 227 00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:27.539 Jenny Duan: Continue. And then, okay, now let's go back to the actual questions. So II see that I think you have 3 application questions, which are this experience of technology? And then 2 future plans. Questions? 228 00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.379 sameeha siraj: Right? Oh, and I asked for like, Oh, URL, Urls, yeah. 229 00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:56.929 Jenny Duan: yeah, you can just send the links. So so once you get for example, your folklift website, once you get that up, you can share that. And like, basically any of your projects like on on, even on figma, I would make your links public and share that say, like, I made this wireframe, or any previous websites that you've developed like that you've sent me. You should send that you should put that there and like basically anything else that you've done. You can just put the link there. 230 00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:07.539 Jenny Duan: all right, let's start with the first question. I think to day I'd like to have a brain storm of all 3 questions done, and then 231 00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.990 Jenny Duan: the next time that we meet, or 232 00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:16.820 Jenny Duan: in 2 times that we meet we should look at like a first draft of what you've written. Yeah 233 00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.260 Jenny Duan: and 234 00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:43.939 Jenny Duan: doing these questions will help you. Because basically in the future, like all of the applications that you do, the questions will build on each other. For example, the questions that you answer for this one might be similar to another application that you do in the future, and it'll just build off of one another, so it'll make it easier for you to apply for things in the future cause I know it's really really hard to like. Just start writing essays with nothing. But in the future it'll build on it itself, and it'll help you develop in that way. Okay. 235 00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.160 Jenny Duan: cool and I think these are all 2 50 words. Right? 236 00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.090 Jenny Duan: Okay. 237 00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.630 Jenny Duan: let me just indicate that. 238 00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.869 Jenny Duan: So 2 50 words is really like, not that much if you think about it. 239 00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.630 sameeha siraj: So do you recommend like writing like to the dot? Like 2 50 words, or 240 00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.120 Jenny Duan: like, yeah, around always. 241 00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.680 Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry. Go ahead. 242 00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:13.359 sameeha siraj: Oh, I just meant like around 2, 50, or like on the dot 2 50. 243 00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:40.370 Jenny Duan: So the 2 50 words is the cap. But I would try to get as close to the cap as possible. So, like 2, 45, 2, 43, something like that like, finish your last thought. But try to get as close to the 2 50 word benchmark as possible. That's always the case. When they give you like a word. A word, count, limit. Your goal should be to try to get as close to that limit as possible, so to write as much as you can, given the the constraints of the limit 244 00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.060 Jenny Duan: and cool. 245 00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:53.810 Jenny Duan: So I remember, we did a brain storm for this. So I just want to copy paste our stuff from the brain storm. okay. 246 00:36:55.190 --> 00:37:01.609 Jenny Duan: So last time, this is what you wrote about. Has that changed since? Now. 247 00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.080 Jenny Duan: who's that? 248 00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:09.479 sameeha siraj: I think like this one is like kind of more important to me than 249 00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:20.010 sameeha siraj: this one? Not as much. It was kind of like the only things that I could think of at that time. I guess 250 00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.589 sameeha siraj: if I had any more ideas it could probably be like 251 00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:41.450 sameeha siraj: maybe, like wanting to help my like community like Prosper with my own like strength. for example, like the folklifting that I'm working on. It would like, help. My own community do like something that I'm passionate with, which is like 252 00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:49.150 sameeha siraj: like, I can develop a website to like support them. And you know, I think technology helps me do that 253 00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.880 Jenny Duan: awesome 254 00:37:52.300 --> 00:38:01.219 Jenny Duan: cool. So I think that for this question. So I'm going to highlight what you need to emphasize with each question. So 255 00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:13.840 Jenny Duan: they're evaluating different aspects of you. I know this because I was a reviewer one year, so they like gave me the rubric that they used for that year. I don't have any more, because it was like that. We only used it for a period of time, but 256 00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:21.359 Jenny Duan: I think they evaluate you based on your overcoming challenges. Your passion and your future for impact. 257 00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.400 Jenny Duan: passion, slash, demonstrate work. Let me just write this down. 258 00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.539 Jenny Duan: be sure to pack. 259 00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:34.769 Jenny Duan: So these are the things that they care about the most. And for this one I would say 260 00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:39.700 Jenny Duan: that what you should this question you should focus on overcoming barriers and your passion. 261 00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.910 Jenny Duan: This one should focus on passion and 262 00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:47.190 Jenny Duan: future impact. And 263 00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.839 Jenny Duan: this question should focus on 264 00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.830 Jenny Duan: passion again and future impact. 265 00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.239 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? 266 00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:11.139 Jenny Duan: So yeah, for these? So for the first question you should talk about overcoming. The second question should be about passion, future impact. And the third should also be about passion and future impact. 267 00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:12.430 Jenny Duan: So. 268 00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.850 Jenny Duan: okay, 269 00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:22.790 Jenny Duan: so I think let's just get into it. Get with these. With these frameworks in mind. 270 00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:29.919 Jenny Duan: I wanna try to frame your first essay as like sort of a journey of you like overcoming challenges? 271 00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:34.390 Jenny Duan: And what challenges can you think of so obviously, there's 272 00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:40.520 Jenny Duan: not a lot of opportunities right? But what other challenges. Have you overcome to get where you are? 273 00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:51.759 sameeha siraj: I don't know if it's like a like a valid like reason, but something that I was thinking of was, this like February, I think I went to a hackathon with like 274 00:39:52.090 --> 00:40:00.269 sameeha siraj: 2 girls and I'd say, like the majority of the people participating were like college students. Who are like 275 00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.980 sameeha siraj: like male 276 00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:13.729 sameeha siraj: so it's like, we're kind of like a unique few like high school girls. And it was like in a different city as well. So it was like an overnight thing, and 277 00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:22.239 sameeha siraj: I drank like 4 power drinks or energy drinks to try like work on it overnight, but like 278 00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:31.009 sameeha siraj: not saying that, like you have to stay with the Internet to make a great project. But I feel like my team mates weren't taking it seriously and like 279 00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:45.060 sameeha siraj: well, we saw, like all the like, older people like working on like these pro great projects, and like explaining it well, and like being able to talk about like what they did. 280 00:40:45.130 --> 00:41:00.370 sameeha siraj: It kind of felt like I was teaching like little kids, and like, I don't know, I just felt like overcoming that. You're able to build like a great project in the end. And implement all the features that I wanted to plan since before the heck phone 281 00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.570 Jenny Duan: make sense. 282 00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:15.319 Jenny Duan: I think that's totally valid, and something that you should consider mentioning in your essay or writing about. Let's do some other brainstorming as well. 283 00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:17.369 Jenny Duan: feel free to just like kind of 284 00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:28.369 Jenny Duan: to go like free flowing in your mind, like what other things come up when you think about your journey with working with technology, any barriers that you've faced, things like that. 285 00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.569 Jenny Duan: What what does your mom do? 286 00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.639 sameeha siraj: My, mom's also a software developer 287 00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.670 Jenny Duan: got it? Okay. 288 00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.580 Jenny Duan: describe journey for human technology. 289 00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:57.600 sameeha siraj: Is, is it like so like my mom kind of has, like a really inspiring story which kind of like inspired me in a way. So like once you got married she became a housewife, for, like almost her entire life. 290 00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:25.250 sameeha siraj: And he really, she's like, always really wanted a job. And like she wanted independence and like terms of financially and like one day like she just found like a program which like helped her. And they didn't really teach how to code or anything. She kind of just watched Youtube tutorials and like, learn and like paved her way, she got a job interview. And like, now, she's like working at Wells Fargo. So I think it's like, really awesome. Yeah. 291 00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:38.779 sameeha siraj: so definitely like seeing my like, my mom go through those things and like finally finding a way. I think that was definitely something that inspired me like to like work harder in technology. 292 00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:48.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is paving her own way in technology. And this speaks to like technology. 293 00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:54.370 Jenny Duan: can be empowering or anyone. 294 00:42:54.390 --> 00:43:10.509 Jenny Duan: And I think that's like what you should emphasize like, how anyone can really take technology as a tool and use it to change the world or do what they want to do, or, you know, learn a new skill, get a new job, etc., like you get what I mean. But that's really awesome. I think you should definitely say that 295 00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.100 Jenny Duan: And 296 00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:21.320 Jenny Duan: let's talk about the. But let's just framed this essay from the beginning to the end. 297 00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:33.259 Jenny Duan: I feel like, if we have a good draft of at least this essay, whether next time we meet or not, a good drop, just a draft. It doesn't have to be a good draft. Just a draft of this essay. By the next time we meet that would be a good goal. 298 00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.109 Jenny Duan: Let me let me just put this in 299 00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:39.020 Jenny Duan: draft assignment. 300 00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:51.789 Jenny Duan: So today, I just want to give you an outline that you can work on it that you can use for a draft of this essay. So I think, for the first part of the essay. Let's just say. 301 00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.559 Jenny Duan: how do we want to start this? How did you become interested? 302 00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.799 Jenny Duan: okay, let's say. 303 00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.270 Jenny Duan: framing, you can say. 304 00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.699 Jenny Duan: growing up. You watched 305 00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.840 Jenny Duan: your mom use technology 306 00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:22.670 Jenny Duan: to like, transform. 307 00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:30.010 Jenny Duan: per live your life, etc., etc., etc. You can. You can change the phrasing. And then 308 00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:37.330 Jenny Duan: what's next? So this is the first part. the emphasis here is 309 00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:44.689 Jenny Duan: emphasized, accessible technology 310 00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.160 Jenny Duan: power of tech. And then 311 00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.760 Jenny Duan: let's say. 312 00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.230 Jenny Duan: technology 313 00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.410 Jenny Duan: to you symbolizes 314 00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.569 Jenny Duan: opportunity and a chance to actively 315 00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.580 Jenny Duan: shape the future. And you can say this because, 316 00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:20.020 Jenny Duan: you have. I guess. are both your parents immigrants? 317 00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:22.939 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, ingrat parents 318 00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.110 Jenny Duan: who came to Bay Area 319 00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.760 Jenny Duan: and 320 00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:46.829 Jenny Duan: work index. So like your parents came to the Bay area. And this like, has shaped your framework for looking at technology as a way to, you know, actively shape the future because your dad is building startups right? He has been building startups. So you can talk about that, too. You can say like. 321 00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.670 Jenny Duan: watching your dad 322 00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:53.170 Jenny Duan: like, okay, let me just put this as the next step 323 00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.049 Jenny Duan: watching, your dad 324 00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.950 Jenny Duan: worked tirelessly 325 00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.810 Jenny Duan: to build startups in hopes of 326 00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.710 Jenny Duan: building a better world 327 00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:16.870 Jenny Duan: inspires students like you can talk about his, you know, experience trying to do the health care, start up, and like other things that he's done you can ask him about, I'm sure. 328 00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:32.429 Jenny Duan: But remember this, you you'd this part should only be the beginning your essay should be about you. It's not about your parents. So I think one thing is to avoid talking about your parents too much, because this should only be like one or 2, like 3 sentences in the beginning to kind of frame. 329 00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:42.089 Jenny Duan: or like a couple sentences at the beginning to frame your essay, but your essay should be focused on your parents, or what they have done because it's about you. This is just for help, brainstorming purposes only. 330 00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.850 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then you can say, like, 331 00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.060 Jenny Duan: Despite this, you found yourself 332 00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.229 Jenny Duan: struggling to find. 333 00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.350 Jenny Duan: see as opportunities in your 334 00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:03.380 Jenny Duan: what's demographics of your town or city like how big or small, like. 335 00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:04.720 Jenny Duan: etc. 336 00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.989 sameeha siraj: I'd say it's pretty small and like compares into other towns 337 00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.000 Jenny Duan: suburban community. 338 00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:18.150 Jenny Duan: So are do a lot of people work in tech or no. 339 00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.560 sameeha siraj: I'd say, like most people actually 340 00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:25.619 Jenny Duan: okay, got it. You've found yourself struggling to find opportunities. 341 00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:30.810 Jenny Duan: do you also 342 00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.030 Jenny Duan: experienced difficulties 343 00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.600 Jenny Duan: engaging 344 00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.119 Jenny Duan: in the space 345 00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.220 Jenny Duan: especially Hi. 346 00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.770 Jenny Duan: And 347 00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:55.340 Jenny Duan: you can this in this paragraph you can write about your hackathon experience 348 00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.849 Jenny Duan: or other experiences that 349 00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:02.840 Jenny Duan: that 350 00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.529 Jenny Duan: made you struggle in your journey. 351 00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:31.370 sameeha siraj: One thing that I kind of want to add throughout the with the essay is like, I kind of relate, like honestly say and how I found my mom struggling, not struggling, but like when she didn't have much of a passion to work on as a housewife, I found myself unable to use technology because of all the obstacles that came with it. And then it could be like 352 00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:45.240 sameeha siraj: but like how she found a job and learned technology on her own technology did the same for me, and it empowered me to work on causes that I'm actually passionate for just like her 353 00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:50.259 Jenny Duan: that's so awesome. I love it. I'm gonna write that down. 354 00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.489 Jenny Duan: encourage you to work on this 355 00:48:53.650 --> 00:49:02.300 Jenny Duan: you're passionate about. And so let's talk about some of the technology experiences that you've had so far. Let's say, empowering a I 356 00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.740 Jenny Duan: right about that. What else? Media at school 357 00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:13.160 Jenny Duan: anchor stuff. What else? 358 00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:23.070 Jenny Duan: X robotics, even though you're not actively doing that, you could still write about it. What else? 359 00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.420 sameeha siraj: Hmm! 360 00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:30.960 Jenny Duan: Oh, dog game development. 361 00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.300 Jenny Duan: sharing your journey 362 00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:35.890 Jenny Duan: on Youtube. 363 00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:39.890 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then you should highlight that. 364 00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:46.039 Jenny Duan: your background like a female Muslim developer. 365 00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:53.839 Jenny Duan: to say, a woman of color all this like you? Should you should a write these words like somewhere insert these because 366 00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.399 Jenny Duan: kind. They're kind of buzz words like. 367 00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:03.779 Jenny Duan: I do admit that it's kind of like buzzwords, but like it will help your application if you if you highlight this about your background. 368 00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:11.649 sameeha siraj: do you? Do you think I should like kind of mentioned, like my introverted background. Or do you think that kind of like weakens my character a little bit? 369 00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.439 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say like 370 00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:18.090 Jenny Duan: you, you felt like. 371 00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:24.560 Jenny Duan: like you felt like you weren't able to express your opinions due to your background in not seeing that represented or valued. 372 00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.590 sameeha siraj: Okay, yeah. Sounds good. 373 00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:27.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 374 00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.469 Jenny Duan: alright cool. 375 00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:43.370 Jenny Duan: sounds good. And then the goal here is to write it from a perspective of like overcoming challenges to find your passion. So you really want to hit that like overcoming challenges? Because 376 00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.100 Jenny Duan: since you don't have as many like. 377 00:50:47.380 --> 00:51:13.040 Jenny Duan: and this is like a good thing. But since you don't have as many disadvantages as other applicants, you need to highlight that you've overcome in some way cause like other applicants, they come from schools where they really like don't have computer science classes, or they don't have technology at all. And so like, they are facing a big challenge there. So you, you wanna highlight that you've overcome like challenges yourself as well. Cool. 378 00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:21.229 Jenny Duan: Ok. I think that we can probably end here. And then a goal would be to try to have a draught of essay one 379 00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:37.899 Jenny Duan: by the next time we meet again. It does not have to be a good draft like. Don't try to have perfection. Just have something down. And it's okay. If it's longer than 250 words we can cut. So don't worry about the word, count. Just write it how you want to, and we'll we'll like, refine it later on. How does that sound? That sounds great. 380 00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.960 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. So 381 00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:53.649 Jenny Duan: again, immediately after this call ends. I want you to go sign up for Hack Club. Let me just put the link in the chat again. So just do that because so you can like, put it as one of the activities that you do. 382 00:51:53.750 --> 00:52:00.099 Jenny Duan: And then other than that, I think everything else should be good, and we can talk in a couple days. 383 00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.020 sameeha siraj: Okay, that sounds great. 384 00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Take care, bye.",

How's it going? 3 00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.639 sameeha siraj: I'm good. How are you? 4 00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:18.250 Jenny Duan: I'm good as well. It's good to see you, I think. Let's just get started. let me share my screen and you can just start with some of your updates if you have any 5 00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:27.099 sameeha siraj: so we were able to get someone to develop or like, start developing our website, or like the technology executive. 6 00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:54.459 sameeha siraj: Yeah, she's like, she says she's working on something else right now, like with another nonprofit. But we told her like, we're not gonna place all our bets on her, because if she's busy with something else, and like she doesn't end up doing it. Then she'll just like have a leadership role for no reason. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna ask her, like, if you can build a website in like one month, then we'll give you the rule. 7 00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:04.589 sameeha siraj: I should agree to it. So yeah, it's we're gonna try like developing it on our own to see like in case she doesn't do it. But yeah. 8 00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.999 Jenny Duan: oh, I feel like. That's a pretty reasonable benchmark, so if she can't develop it, then do you have some one that you have in mind for a back up? 9 00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.469 sameeha siraj: No. So I might just like start developing it on my own, maybe 10 00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.489 Jenny Duan: awesome. And how's it going with the curriculum development? 11 00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:33.709 sameeha siraj: We weren't able to make like slideshows or anything. We're actually gonna meet tomorrow after school to talk about it. But yeah. 12 00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:42.420 sameeha siraj: and for folklift I have 2 calls after this and we're gonna ta",
    "lk about like 13 00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.510 sameeha siraj: like when to set up our meeting and stuff. And yeah. 14 00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:59.950 Jenny Duan: yay, that's so awesome. And is there someone that's going to help you film? Or how do you envision this sewing process to go? Are you going to bring a tripod or during the actual filming. Who's going to help you? Film? 15 00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:29.409 sameeha siraj: Yeah. So my friend, she's a freshman in college right now, and she's doing film. And I propose this to her, and she agreed. She said. Just like, let me know when you wanna film and she has camera equipment. And so do I. So we're gonna bring so before we actually go to film, we're gonna make like a document for each one. And then we're gonna like plan like questions. We're gonna ask them some shots that we want for their thing. And also. 16 00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:41.349 sameeha siraj: I think during the calls, I wanna like kind of ask them what they envision for their ad and like what they really want from us. So yeah, we're gonna do a planning on the dock, and then 17 00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:48.089 sameeha siraj: when they like the time that they agreed to, we're gonna go and meet and try to film on one day. 18 00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.930 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. 19 00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.190 Jenny Duan: Cool. 20 00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.360 Jenny Duan: So the next thing is. 21 00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:03.050 Jenny Duan: how's the SAT going? Actually, you haven't had a chance to take another one. Right? Yeah. 22 00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:12.439 Jenny Duan: Okay. So folklift. Seems like it's going well. So they have 2 calls set up, and then the other 5. You're gonna set up, maybe, like later this week or next week 23 00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:18.810 Jenny Duan: cool. And then for your Youtube channel, were you able to get that unity game tutorial up? 24 00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:37.600 sameeha siraj: I'm a bit behind on like the Youtube. Yeah, I th",
    "ink the problem is, I thought I had like the editing software on this computer. But I think I don't have anymore. So I might have to try to transfer it to my other computer. So yeah. 25 00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.539 Jenny Duan: is it, do you need that exact software? Or would it be possible to do different software. 26 00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:50.019 sameeha siraj: I could use any software. I just feel like I'm I've been using this one. So maybe 27 00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.659 sameeha siraj: I mean, I could use any. But yeah. 28 00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.620 Jenny Duan: okay, cause I feel like. 29 00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:15.450 Jenny Duan: if we're trying to remove road blocks, if you're if it's just like a software issue, then if it blocks you for like the rest of the week. Then I would say, just download another software if you're not able to get it transferred. But if you're able to give transferred, or if you're just able to use the other computer, then I would just go with that instead. If that's a major blocker for you. 30 00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:22.289 Jenny Duan: Cool. So transfer. I'm not a different software group. 31 00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:38.320 Jenny Duan: Okay, today, I'm just doing like a quick check in. I don't. I'm not trying to spend too much time on the actual check, in part because I want to get into Thecwit application. So I just want to go through everything sort of touching face and then going to the application. 32 00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.000 Jenny Duan: So how's film club going? 33 00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:47.250 sameeha siraj: We're gonna hold our first meeting this week and we're gonna 34 00:10:47.300 --> 00:11:13.039 sameeha siraj: first start off by like a signing rules. I guess cause we'll have like actors, editors, filmers and script writers and such. So we kind of wanna keep people involved early. So after that, we're gonna ask them like, for first, short film, what genre do you guys wanna make it? And then my officers, we're thinking of",
    " like 35 00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:27.819 sameeha siraj: writing the script ourselves. Cause a lot of the people get disinterested in that phase. So we wanna try writing it by ourselves. But we needed, like the genre that they're interested in making first. So that's where we're gonna 36 00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.740 sameeha siraj: try to get the meeting out first. 37 00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.350 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 38 00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:42.979 Jenny Duan: So I realized I forgot to give you tasks from last week. I feel like you still made good progress. But I'm just going to put that down here. This week, just in case. 39 00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.720 Jenny Duan: So I would say, for empowering AI, maybe 40 00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.539 Jenny Duan: start it first, let's show. 41 00:11:53.830 --> 00:12:01.179 Jenny Duan: or actually just finish first slideshow. I would say the slide shows can be about 40 slides. 42 00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:14.119 Jenny Duan: and this will give you the flexibility to talk for either like 30 or 60 min depending on how long you want to make each session. But I think about 40, like decent slides, is a good benchmark. 43 00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:42.990 sameeha siraj: Feel obviously feel free to have more or less depending on how the curriculum actually plays out. But yeah, do you feel like finishing? One slideshow this week is realistic. Or do you feel like that's too much of a rush? I think we could actually tomorrow, like when me and my like the Co. Founder when we sit down and we like, do the meeting. I think we can just make those 40 make any changes like if we need to throughout the week. But I think we could like, basically like. 44 00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.910 sameeha siraj: make it tomorrow. 45 00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.689 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then Youtube channel. 46 00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.670 Jenny Duan: Okay. 47 00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.600 Jenny Duan: let's see, how's the Congressional app challenge going? 48 00:13:",
    "03.310 --> 00:13:18.800 sameeha siraj: Yeah. So it's like, not many updates since the last time. But yeah, I think we're starting to plan out like our like color scheme that we wanna go with and like kind of where we want to go with like the features and stuff. 49 00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.880 sameeha siraj: So we really wanna add, like 50 00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.129 sameeha siraj: something unique. Also, like I reached out to 51 00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:46.109 sameeha siraj: I think she graduated like 2 years ago. Someone from our school who won the Congressional app challenge, and I asked her. She has like any tips on, like making a project that's like worthy of getting a win and she gave some tips, saying that like it should have like an impact and try to explain like every single little feature. So, yeah. 52 00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.270 Jenny Duan: that's awesome. 53 00:13:48.670 --> 00:14:02.130 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I think again, like having something that has an impact is also good, like something that's tangible. I know someone who won it in the past. And she hers was like creating a network for sexual soul survivors. 54 00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:21.080 Jenny Duan: And that was really cool, like she actually got her up on the app store and then she like went to Columbia, and graduated from Columbia. So that's like pretty cool. You can. I'm actually gonna show her her. I'm gonna show you her Instagram, because she also kind of has, like a more professional Instagram. 55 00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.500 Jenny Duan: so 56 00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.309 Jenny Duan: you can see what it puts, what her app is like. 57 00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.890 Jenny Duan: one moment. 58 00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.629 Jenny Duan: She is also a code with classy scholar. This is a programme that you should apply for later. 59 00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:59.799 Jenny Duan: But I'll bring it up. The application's not open until like December, so I'll bring it up then. But this is her National Wome",
    "n's Day, because it's classy. I'm trying to find her app. 60 00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.940 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is her winning pickup prize. 61 00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:12.209 Jenny Duan: Oh, here's her app readawn app. It's on the app store now, which is pretty cool. 62 00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.350 Jenny Duan: So this could be you, too. That's not cool. 63 00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.270 Jenny Duan: Anyways. So okay, I think. 64 00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.900 Jenny Duan: oh, the last thing is the video game project. Do you have an update on that? 65 00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:34.270 sameeha siraj: Yeah. So I implemented like a lot of features this time. I was trying to like before. I wasn't sure but 66 00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:55.710 sameeha siraj: like I wanted to seen where, like the like. The older sister. She was like following the characters. So then they could go to the lab. I was able to implement the feature that she, like gets the animations when she's following her around. And I started writing the dialogue for like when they discovered the problem. So like 67 00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:12.529 sameeha siraj: when they're like in the older sister's dorm, and then they're like, Oh, I can't believe what's happening. Let's go to the lab to see if we could talk to like one of the professors. And then like. Then they walk there, and that's when the animation plays out 68 00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.160 Jenny Duan: cool. 69 00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.589 Jenny Duan: And then what is your goal. Do you have a goal for the video game project for next week? 70 00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.770 sameeha siraj: I would say. 71 00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.620 sameeha siraj: Maybe like solidify the dialogue 72 00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.380 sameeha siraj: and like. 73 00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.099 sameeha siraj: I guess. 74 00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:41.310 sameeha siraj: make like start, like making like the environment for the like. The regression model scene. I think I've been working on it fo",
    "r some time. But 75 00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.349 sameeha siraj: I need to like come up with the art as well. So 76 00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:58.619 Jenny Duan: got it. all right. That sounds good. So I wanted to redirect our the rest of our time and our attention to the NCWI. T. Application, were you able to email them and get in? 77 00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.809 sameeha siraj: Actually, I tried it on my other gmail, and then I was able to sign up there. 78 00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:09.520 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, that's perfect. Can you share your screen? Thanks. And 79 00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.390 sameeha siraj: okay, 80 00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.580 sameeha siraj: okay? 81 00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.730 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 82 00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:04.820 Jenny Duan: oh, also make sure you request consent from your parents. Yeah, just put in like your your dad or mom's email. 83 00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:25.599 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then let's do your application now. So have you. You haven't created one. Right? So create application. 84 00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.849 Jenny Duan: I love the theme. It's like Barbie. 85 00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:47.199 Jenny Duan: Okay.

Let's say, the technic computing or technology classes. Notice what I get. 178 00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:42.190 Jenny Duan: So like for the question that says, no computing or technology classes. 179 00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:44.259 Jenny Duan: Do you see that one? 180 00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.250 sameeha siraj: Oh, there's something. 181 00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.350 Jenny Duan: Yes, I'm not sure 182 00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.699 Jenny Duan: or actually no, because you do know. 183 00:28:52.370 --> 00:29:11.809 sameeha siraj: I say, say that it's really difficult to get into computing classes at your school, which is like true. Because I could talk about like I'm able to finish the computer science like pathway at my school, although I wasn't able to like I wasn't able to take it before. 184 00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:26.380 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you can say, like, there's a very limited number of computer science classes which makes it really difficult to take which makes it difficult to access them. So yeah, there's a very limited amount of 185 00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.859 Jenny Duan: computer science classes. Courses. Yeah. 186 00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.500 sameeha siraj: whatever you want, and spots offered, and spots for those classes 187 00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.759 Jenny Duan: like, there's a first, a limited number of classes. Second, there's a limited number of spots. 188 00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and spots offered. 189 00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:59.699 Jenny Duan: you don't have to say to to you at your school.

    "say offert comma then you can finish the rest like, which makes it difficult, or which makes it nearly impossible to get into classes, or something like that 190 00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.000 Jenny Duan: in your words. 191 00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.909 sameeha siraj: Okay. 192 00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.170 sameeha siraj: alright. 193 00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.710 Jenny Duan: 2 2, 194 00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.379 Jenny Duan: take them, or to enroll, or something 195 00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.900 sameeha siraj: nice courses 196 00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:21.319 sameeha siraj: or actually to finish the pathway, maybe. 197 00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.009 Jenny Duan: or to just to take classes to take the classes 198 00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.229 sameeha siraj: should not describe like, how I overcame them or 199 00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.290 Jenny Duan: no. Okay. 200 00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:42.509 Jenny Duan: they're just right now. They're just scoring you, based on your barriers, not how you overcame them. That's a different section. Ok, what other barriers do you have? 201 00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.810 sameeha siraj: Hmm. 202 00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:52.289 sameeha siraj: I guess there's like kinda like a misrepresentation in some of the clubs. 203 00:30:52.340 --> 00:31:01.330 sameeha siraj: I don't know if that like accounts, but like in Hackathon Club, like the officers are all kind of just boys and 204 00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:11.629 sameeha siraj: I like. I feel like there's no girl representation on the officers or in the club cause. There's like, only like a handful and the entire club. There's like 300 members so 205 00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.250 Jenny Duan: well, you can say There's also 206 00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:38.899 Jenny Duan: a significant gender disparity in clubs which makes it difficult to join, for example. which makes it difficult to access. For example, in the Hackathon Club, which has over 300 members, there are only a handful, so less than 5 girls 207 0",
    "0:31:49.010 --> 00:31:51.510 Jenny Duan: say, access instead of participate 208 00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.169 Jenny Duan: which makes and say that makes them difficult to access. 209 00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:09.879 Jenny Duan: for example, should be a new sentence. pick a period. And then, for example. 210 00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:39.770 Jenny Duan: yeah. And Bea only has around 5 girls. It'd be better for Burbage. Okay, that sounds like a good response. Is there anything else that you can think of 211 00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.619 again like any barriers you can think of? 212 00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:56.119 Jenny Duan: Or do you have chromebooks like? Can you only use chromebooks at school like how to stop work. or did you take it home? You could use any of you could like bring it home as well? 213 00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.190 sameeha siraj: But 214 00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.460 sameeha siraj: I'd say, like, does this have to be like technological barriers or 215 00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.379 Jenny Duan: yeah technology barriers? 216 00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:13.959 Jenny Duan: If if not, then then it's okay. You can be done. With this question, if there's anything else, though, that you can think about. 217 00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.309 Jenny Duan: So be a good time. 218 00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:23.359 sameeha siraj: I think that's all. I think I'll think about this more. 219 00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:32.409 Jenny Duan: okay, sounds good because they do score you on like, how? How many barriers that you've overcome? 220 00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.850 sameeha siraj: Okay, 221 00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:43.460 Jenny Duan: all right, just press. Continue to save it. The 222 00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.090 Jenny Duan: okay. And now 223 00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.510 Jenny Duan: I think now you're on additional information. 224 00:33:52.660 --> 00:34:06.619 Jenny Duan: Is English. Say no. If it's not, if if you've spoken another language before, what's your first language? Write that or do",
    ". Okay, perfect. And then this, yeah, this, you have to just say what the truth. 225 00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.639 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I continue. 226 00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:15.130 Jenny Duan: And then, oh, the terms and conditions you can just sign it. Now it's fine. 227 00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:27.539 Jenny Duan: Continue. And then, okay, now let's go back to the actual questions. So II see that I think you have 3 application questions, which are this experience of technology? And then 2 future plans. Questions? 228 00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.379 sameeha siraj: Right? Oh, and I asked for like, Oh, URL, Urls, yeah. 229 00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:56.929 Jenny Duan: yeah, you can just send the links. So so once you get for example, your folklift website, once you get that up, you can share that. And like, basically any of your projects like on on, even on figma, I would make your links public and share that say, like, I made this wireframe, or any previous websites that you've developed like that you've sent me. You should send that you should put that there and like basically anything else that you've done. You can just put the link there. 230 00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:07.539 Jenny Duan: all right, let's start with the first question. I think to day I'd like to have a brain storm of all 3 questions done, and then 231 00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.990 Jenny Duan: the next time that we meet, or 232 00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:16.820 Jenny Duan: in 2 times that we meet we should look at like a first draft of what you've written. Yeah 233 00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.260 Jenny Duan: and 234 00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:43.939 Jenny Duan: doing these questions will help you. Because basically in the future, like all of the applications that you do, the questions will build on each other. For example, the questions that you answer for this one might be similar to another application that you do in the future, and it'll just build off of one another, so it'll make it easier for you to apply for things ",
    "in the future cause I know it's really really hard to like. Just start writing essays with nothing. But in the future it'll build on it itself, and it'll help you develop in that way. Okay. 235 00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.160 Jenny Duan: cool and I think these are all 2 50 words. Right? 236 00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.090 Jenny Duan: Okay. 237 00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.630 Jenny Duan: let me just indicate that. 238 00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.869 Jenny Duan: So 2 50 words is really like, not that much if you think about it. 239 00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.630 sameeha siraj: So do you recommend like writing like to the dot? Like 2 50 words, or 240 00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.120 Jenny Duan: like, yeah, around always. 241 00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.680 Jenny Duan: Oh, sorry. Go ahead. 242 00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:13.359 sameeha siraj: Oh, I just meant like around 2, 50, or like on the dot 2 50. 243 00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:40.370 Jenny Duan: So the 2 50 words is the cap. But I would try to get as close to the cap as possible. So, like 2, 45, 2, 43, something like that like, finish your last thought. But try to get as close to the 2 50 word benchmark as possible. That's always the case. When they give you like a word. A word, count, limit. Your goal should be to try to get as close to that limit as possible, so to write as much as you can, given the the constraints of the limit 244 00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.060 Jenny Duan: and cool. 245 00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:53.810 Jenny Duan: So I remember, we did a brain storm for this. So I just want to copy paste our stuff from the brain storm. okay. 246 00:36:55.190 --> 00:37:01.609 Jenny Duan: So last time, this is what you wrote about. Has that changed since? Now. 247 00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.080 Jenny Duan: who's that? 248 00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:09.479 sameeha siraj: I think like this one is like kind of more important to me than 249 00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:20.010 sameeha siraj: this one? Not as much. It was kind of like the only things that",
    " I could think of at that time. I guess 250 00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.589 sameeha siraj: if I had any more ideas it could probably be like 251 00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:41.450 sameeha siraj: maybe, like wanting to help my like community like Prosper with my own like strength. for example, like the folklifting that I'm working on. It would like, help. My own community do like something that I'm passionate with, which is like 252 00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:49.150 sameeha siraj: like, I can develop a website to like support them. And you know, I think technology helps me do that 253 00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.880 Jenny Duan: awesome 254 00:37:52.300 --> 00:38:01.219 Jenny Duan: cool. So I think that for this question. So I'm going to highlight what you need to emphasize with each question. So 255 00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:13.840 Jenny Duan: they're evaluating different aspects of you. I know this because I was a reviewer one year, so they like gave me the rubric that they used for that year. I don't have any more, because it was like that. We only used it for a period of time, but 256 00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:21.359 Jenny Duan: I think they evaluate you based on your overcoming challenges. Your passion and your future for impact. 257 00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.400 Jenny Duan: passion, slash, demonstrate work. Let me just write this down. 258 00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.539 Jenny Duan: be sure to pack. 259 00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:34.769 Jenny Duan: So these are the things that they care about the most. And for this one I would say 260 00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:39.700 Jenny Duan: that what you should this question you should focus on overcoming barriers and your passion. 261 00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.910 Jenny Duan: This one should focus on passion and 262 00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:47.190 Jenny Duan: future impact. And 263 00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.839 Jenny Duan: this question should focus on 264 00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.830 Jenny Duan: passion again and future impact. 265 00:38:58.260 --> 0",
    "0:39:00.239 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? 266 00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:11.139 Jenny Duan: So yeah, for these? So for the first question you should talk about overcoming. The second question should be about passion, future impact. And the third should also be about passion and future impact. 267 00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:12.430 Jenny Duan: So. 268 00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.850 Jenny Duan: okay, 269 00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:22.790 Jenny Duan: so I think let's just get into it. Get with these. With these frameworks in mind. 270 00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:29.919 Jenny Duan: I wanna try to frame your first essay as like sort of a journey of you like overcoming challenges? 271 00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:34.390 Jenny Duan: And what challenges can you think of so obviously, there's 272 00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:40.520 Jenny Duan: not a lot of opportunities right? But what other challenges. Have you overcome to get where you are? 273 00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:51.759 sameeha siraj: I don't know if it's like a like a valid like reason, but something that I was thinking of was, this like February, I think I went to a hackathon with like 274 00:39:52.090 --> 00:40:00.269 sameeha siraj: 2 girls and I'd say, like the majority of the people participating were like college students. Who are like 275 00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.980 sameeha siraj: like male 276 00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:13.729 sameeha siraj: so it's like, we're kind of like a unique few like high school girls. And it was like in a different city as well. So it was like an overnight thing, and 277 00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:22.239 sameeha siraj: I drank like 4 power drinks or energy drinks to try like work on it overnight, but like 278 00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:31.009 sameeha siraj: not saying that, like you have to stay with the Internet to make a great project. But I feel like my team mates weren't taking it seriously and like 279 00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:45.060 sameeha siraj: well, we saw, like all the like, older people like working on like thes",
    "e pro great projects, and like explaining it well, and like being able to talk about like what they did. 280 00:40:45.130 --> 00:41:00.370 sameeha siraj: It kind of felt like I was teaching like little kids, and like, I don't know, I just felt like overcoming that. You're able to build like a great project in the end. And implement all the features that I wanted to plan since before the heck phone 281 00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.570 Jenny Duan: make sense. 282 00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:15.319 Jenny Duan: I think that's totally valid, and something that you should consider mentioning in your essay or writing about. Let's do some other brainstorming as well. 283 00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:17.369 Jenny Duan: feel free to just like kind of 284 00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:28.369 Jenny Duan: to go like free flowing in your mind, like what other things come up when you think about your journey with working with technology, any barriers that you've faced, things like that. 285 00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.569 Jenny Duan: What what does your mom do? 286 00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.639 sameeha siraj: My, mom's also a software developer 287 00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.670 Jenny Duan: got it? Okay. 288 00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.580 Jenny Duan: describe journey for human technology. 289 00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:57.600 sameeha siraj: Is, is it like so like my mom kind of has, like a really inspiring story which kind of like inspired me in a way. So like once you got married she became a housewife, for, like almost her entire life. 290 00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:25.250 sameeha siraj: And he really, she's like, always really wanted a job. And like she wanted independence and like terms of financially and like one day like she just found like a program which like helped her. And they didn't really teach how to code or anything. She kind of just watched Youtube tutorials and like, learn and like paved her way, she got a job interview. And like, now, she's like working at Wells Fargo. So I think it's like, real",
    "ly awesome. Yeah. 291 00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:38.779 sameeha siraj: so definitely like seeing my like, my mom go through those things and like finally finding a way. I think that was definitely something that inspired me like to like work harder in technology. 292 00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:48.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is paving her own way in technology. And this speaks to like technology. 293 00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:54.370 Jenny Duan: can be empowering or anyone. 294 00:42:54.390 --> 00:43:10.509 Jenny Duan: And I think that's like what you should emphasize like, how anyone can really take technology as a tool and use it to change the world or do what they want to do, or, you know, learn a new skill, get a new job, etc., like you get what I mean. But that's really awesome. I think you should definitely say that 295 00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.100 Jenny Duan: And 296 00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:21.320 Jenny Duan: let's talk about the. But let's just framed this essay from the beginning to the end. 297 00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:33.259 Jenny Duan: I feel like, if we have a good draft of at least this essay, whether next time we meet or not, a good drop, just a draft. It doesn't have to be a good draft. Just a draft of this essay. By the next time we meet that would be a good goal. 298 00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.109 Jenny Duan: Let me let me just put this in 299 00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:39.020 Jenny Duan: draft assignment. 300 00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:51.789 Jenny Duan: So today, I just want to give you an outline that you can work on it that you can use for a draft of this essay. So I think, for the first part of the essay. Let's just say. 301 00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.559 Jenny Duan: how do we want to start this? How did you become interested? 302 00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.799 Jenny Duan: okay, let's say. 303 00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.270 Jenny Duan: framing, you can say. 304 00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.699 Jenny Duan: growing up. You watched 305 00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.840 Jenny Duan:",
    " your mom use technology 306 00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:22.670 Jenny Duan: to like, transform. 307 00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:30.010 Jenny Duan: per live your life, etc., etc., etc. You can. You can change the phrasing. And then 308 00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:37.330 Jenny Duan: what's next? So this is the first part. the emphasis here is 309 00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:44.689 Jenny Duan: emphasized, accessible technology 310 00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.160 Jenny Duan: power of tech. And then 311 00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.760 Jenny Duan: let's say. 312 00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.230 Jenny Duan: technology 313 00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.410 Jenny Duan: to you symbolizes 314 00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.569 Jenny Duan: opportunity and a chance to actively 315 00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.580 Jenny Duan: shape the future. And you can say this because, 316 00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:20.020 Jenny Duan: you have. I guess. are both your parents immigrants? 317 00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:22.939 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, ingrat parents 318 00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.110 Jenny Duan: who came to Bay Area 319 00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.760 Jenny Duan: and 320 00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:46.829 Jenny Duan: work index. So like your parents came to the Bay area. And this like, has shaped your framework for looking at technology as a way to, you know, actively shape the future because your dad is building startups right? He has been building startups. So you can talk about that, too. You can say like. 321 00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.670 Jenny Duan: watching your dad 322 00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:53.170 Jenny Duan: like, okay, let me just put this as the next step 323 00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.049 Jenny Duan: watching, your dad 324 00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.950 Jenny Duan: worked tirelessly 325 00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.810 Jenny Duan: to build startups in hopes of 326 00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.710 Jenny Duan: building a better world 327 00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:16.870 Jenny Duan: inspires students like you can talk about his, you kn",
    "ow, experience trying to do the health care, start up, and like other things that he's done you can ask him about, I'm sure. 328 00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:32.429 Jenny Duan: But remember this, you you'd this part should only be the beginning your essay should be about you. It's not about your parents. So I think one thing is to avoid talking about your parents too much, because this should only be like one or 2, like 3 sentences in the beginning to kind of frame. 329 00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:42.089 Jenny Duan: or like a couple sentences at the beginning to frame your essay, but your essay should be focused on your parents, or what they have done because it's about you. This is just for help, brainstorming purposes only. 330 00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.850 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then you can say, like, 331 00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.060 Jenny Duan: Despite this, you found yourself 332 00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.229 Jenny Duan: struggling to find. 333 00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.350 Jenny Duan: see as opportunities in your 334 00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:03.380 Jenny Duan: what's demographics of your town or city like how big or small, like. 335 00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:04.720 Jenny Duan: etc. 336 00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.989 sameeha siraj: I'd say it's pretty small and like compares into other towns 337 00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.000 Jenny Duan: suburban community. 338 00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:18.150 Jenny Duan: So are do a lot of people work in tech or no. 339 00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.560 sameeha siraj: I'd say, like most people actually 340 00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:25.619 Jenny Duan: okay, got it. You've found yourself struggling to find opportunities. 341 00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:30.810 Jenny Duan: do you also 342 00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.030 Jenny Duan: experienced difficulties 343 00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.600 Jenny Duan: engaging 344 00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.119 Jenny Duan: in the space 345 00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.220 Jenny Duan: especially Hi. 346 00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.770 Je",
    "nny Duan: And 347 00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:55.340 Jenny Duan: you can this in this paragraph you can write about your hackathon experience 348 00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.849 Jenny Duan: or other experiences that 349 00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:02.840 Jenny Duan: that 350 00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.529 Jenny Duan: made you struggle in your journey. 351 00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:31.370 sameeha siraj: One thing that I kind of want to add throughout the with the essay is like, I kind of relate, like honestly say and how I found my mom struggling, not struggling, but like when she didn't have much of a passion to work on as a housewife, I found myself unable to use technology because of all the obstacles that came with it. And then it could be like 352 00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:45.240 sameeha siraj: but like how she found a job and learned technology on her own technology did the same for me, and it empowered me to work on causes that I'm actually passionate for just like her 353 00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:50.259 Jenny Duan: that's so awesome. I love it. I'm gonna write that down. 354 00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.489 Jenny Duan: encourage you to work on this 355 00:48:53.650 --> 00:49:02.300 Jenny Duan: you're passionate about. And so let's talk about some of the technology experiences that you've had so far. Let's say, empowering a I 356 00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.740 Jenny Duan: right about that. What else? Media at school 357 00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:13.160 Jenny Duan: anchor stuff. What else? 358 00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:23.070 Jenny Duan: X robotics, even though you're not actively doing that, you could still write about it. What else? 359 00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.420 sameeha siraj: Hmm! 360 00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:30.960 Jenny Duan: Oh, dog game development. 361 00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.300 Jenny Duan: sharing your journey 362 00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:35.890 Jenny Duan: on Youtube. 363 00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:39.890 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then you should highlight that. 364 00:49:40.530 --> 00:",
    "49:46.039 Jenny Duan: your background like a female Muslim developer. 365 00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:53.839 Jenny Duan: to say, a woman of color all this like you? Should you should a write these words like somewhere insert these because 366 00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.399 Jenny Duan: kind. They're kind of buzz words like. 367 00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:03.779 Jenny Duan: I do admit that it's kind of like buzzwords, but like it will help your application if you if you highlight this about your background. 368 00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:11.649 sameeha siraj: do you? Do you think I should like kind of mentioned, like my introverted background. Or do you think that kind of like weakens my character a little bit? 369 00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.439 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say like 370 00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:18.090 Jenny Duan: you, you felt like. 371 00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:24.560 Jenny Duan: like you felt like you weren't able to express your opinions due to your background in not seeing that represented or valued. 372 00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.590 sameeha siraj: Okay, yeah. Sounds good. 373 00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:27.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 374 00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.469 Jenny Duan: alright cool. 375 00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:43.370 Jenny Duan: sounds good. And then the goal here is to write it from a perspective of like overcoming challenges to find your passion. So you really want to hit that like overcoming challenges? Because 376 00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.100 Jenny Duan: since you don't have as many like. 377 00:50:47.380 --> 00:51:13.040 Jenny Duan: and this is like a good thing. But since you don't have as many disadvantages as other applicants, you need to highlight that you've overcome in some way cause like other applicants, they come from schools where they really like don't have computer science classes, or they don't have technology at all. And so like, they are facing a big challenge there. So you, you wanna highlight that you've overcome like challenges yourself as well. C",
    "ool. 378 00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:21.229 Jenny Duan: Ok. I think that we can probably end here. And then a goal would be to try to have a draught of essay one 379 00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:37.899 Jenny Duan: by the next time we meet again. It does not have to be a good draft like. Don't try to have perfection. Just have something down. And it's okay. If it's longer than 250 words we can cut. So don't worry about the word, count. Just write it how you want to, and we'll we'll like, refine it later on. How does that sound? That sounds great. 380 00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.960 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. So 381 00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:53.649 Jenny Duan: again, immediately after this call ends. I want you to go sign up for Hack Club. Let me just put the link in the chat again. So just do that because so you can like, put it as one of the activities that you do. 382 00:51:53.750 --> 00:52:00.099 Jenny Duan: And then other than that, I think everything else should be good, and we can talk in a couple days. 383 00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.020 sameeha siraj: Okay, that sounds great. 384 00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Take care, bye."
