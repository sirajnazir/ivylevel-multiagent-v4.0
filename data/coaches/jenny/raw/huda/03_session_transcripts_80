How's it going. 2 00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.899 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.620 Jenny Duan: Doing that, too? Yeah. How is? How's your weekend been? What have you been up to? 4 00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.920 huda: It's been pretty I guess. 5 00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:54.969 huda: Kind of relaxed, I guess. I mean, I've been like working on my essays and everything. But I feel like it's been a lot like less stressful than the past few weeks. So yeah. 6 00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.440 huda: not too bad. 7 00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:12.188 Jenny Duan: That's good to hear. Yeah, I've loved seeing your progress so far. I feel like it's everything's going really good for jcamp. I think that keeping it as an Ec. Is nice, because then you get the opportunity to write about it, which I feel like you wouldn't get if you were 8 00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.870 Jenny Duan: doing like 9 00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.299 Jenny Duan: it as an award. What do you think. 10 00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.319 huda: Yeah, yeah, I think I realize that. And I guess maybe like the podcast. Club isn't as important. 11 00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree, especially since you haven't been involved with it for too long. 12 00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.260 Jenny Duan: cool. So I think maybe we can start by just 13 00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.079 Jenny Duan: looking at your Stanford supplements. I saw that you went over some revisions. 14 00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.890 Jenny Duan: If we could walk through those. 15 00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.500 Jenny Duan: how does that sound. 16 00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.449 huda: Yeah, that sounds good. 17 00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.659 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! 18 00:07:50.060 --> 00:08:09.360 huda: Yeah. Okay. So with the what this is like, the why you at Stanford, I say, so I did kind of like a pretty like large change, so I kind of got rid of the whole like. I'll be a storyteller. I'll be like a coding leader, and I kind of changed that so that 19 00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:26.389 huda: it reflects like the improvising innovator. Better. So like, I kind of like proposed a problem. And then, or like, I kind of set a problem. And then I proposed kind of like what my solution to that is, and how I'll leverage like Stanford to help me like 20 00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:47.180 huda: to solve that, I guess. Like, for example, the 1st one I talk about like how I'll use the Braden storytelling Grant to kind of help like the mainstream narrative like lack of Indian Muslim representation. And so like, yeah, I just kind of changed the format. So I guess there's still kind of like 2 different paragraphs. 21 00:08:47.700 --> 00:09:04.939 huda: Like this one's about storytelling, and this one's about coding. But like it's just not as like super separated, I guess. And then because of that. I also to shorten like this section. Which is about like the saffron improvisation. 22 00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.980 huda: so yeah, I had to like shorten that. 23 00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:15.750 huda: And then, oh, yeah, and also like my dad. He read over it, and he felt like I repeated sunbucks 2 times. 24 00:09:16.086 --> 00:09:23.799 huda: And I think the other time was in the additional information, and he said it might sound like a buzzer word or something like that. 25 00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.399 Jenny Duan: Okay, that makes sense. I like what you did here with the change. 26 00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.830 Jenny Duan: I feel like. 27 00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:51.280 Jenny Duan: yeah, I feel like, this is, I feel like this is good. I like how you made these parts more specific. I think, right here, just this last sentence of this paragraph, when traditional algorithms fail diverse learners. I'll build, adapt, study buddies. I feel like this could also be a little bit more specific. 28 00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.160 huda: Maybe instead of out, I can just say, like something like 29 00:09:56.713 --> 00:10:02.750 huda: like about education, like when traditional lesson plans fail, diverse learners. Maybe. 30 00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.490 Jenny Duan: That's good. Yeah. 31 00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.600 huda: Or can I just do lessons. 32 00:10:20.023 --> 00:10:23.430 Jenny Duan: I think lessons is good. Yeah, I don't think we need to sprite plan. 33 00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.610 Jenny Duan: alright, I think this is good. How many words is this. 34 00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:46.410 huda: This is 2, 51. So I have to get rid of one word. 35 00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.450 Jenny Duan: Okay. 36 00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:29.670 huda: Also does this wording when Ml. Models ignore cultural nuances. Do you think that makes sense. 37 00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.419 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. Yes. 38 00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.530 huda: Okay. 39 00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.940 huda: maybe I can get rid of like voicing them here. 40 00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think voicing. Get rid of voicing them, and then 41 00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.540 Jenny Duan: think that should be exactly 2 50 words. 42 00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.310 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect. 43 00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.120 huda: Hey? 44 00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.539 huda: I think that's all of them finalized. Then I think. 45 00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:32.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah, can I? We look at your your activities list just one more time. Or did you change anything else? Because did you take out J. Cam, and put it back in, or did you just not take it out? In the 1st place. 46 00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.639 huda: I did change it. 47 00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.850 huda: Yeah, I didn't change it. Wait, let me just open up like how it looks like on the common app. 48 00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:53.539 huda: Because I did add, like the the lines to separate them, because I realized, like with the Unc. Application, it looked like really kind of confusing, especially when it ended up, ended with like a capital letter. 49 00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:55.900 huda: Let me share my screen 50 00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.079 huda: so it'll look like oh, wait! 51 00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.000 huda: I think 52 00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.120 huda: I'm not sure why, but 53 00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.760 huda: there's no space after Google here. I'll just do this. 54 00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.380 Jenny Duan: I mean, you sent me this. Okay, this looks good. 55 00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.279 Jenny Duan: Your your extracurriculars are really strong. 56 00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.909 huda: Thank you. 57 00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.700 huda: Yeah. I think I didn't really get rid of much. I just like 58 00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.260 huda: I just had to like, remove spaces and stuff some places. 59 00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:55.400 huda: But yeah, I think I think that's oh, yeah, actually, my dad was wondering for the last one for independent. Over here. 60 00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:09.289 huda: he thought. This last bit compete in college hackathons was a little vague. And he thought that like, for example, cruise hacks is one of them that I went to so he thought, if I should just like name, drop that. 61 00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.889 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that looks good, do you have? If you have word, count? 62 00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.010 Jenny Duan: I mean, how many, how many hackathons have you been to. 63 00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.630 huda: Maybe like 15. 64 00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:37.499 Jenny Duan: Oh, maybe like college Hackathon would be good in that case, because I feel like, if you're specific, like, I think they'll get the point, because if you're too vague, then 65 00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.340 Jenny Duan: I mean, if you choose specific, then it won't show the key. 66 00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.230 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say you've been competed in 15 college hackathons, and you can spare 2 more characters. 67 00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.950 huda: Okay, this is like. 68 00:14:49.753 --> 00:14:51.370 huda: the limit at the limit. 69 00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.640 Jenny Duan: Oh! 70 00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.710 huda: Like. I even had to get rid of the. 71 00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:03.339 Jenny Duan: Can you take? Can you take post pandemic? You just write pandemic unemployment 72 00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.810 Jenny Duan: and then add 15 73 00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.340 Jenny Duan: number. 74 00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.359 Jenny Duan: There you go. 75 00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.270 huda: Okay. 76 00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.420 huda: I'm in 9th grade as well. 77 00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.280 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. 78 00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:28.130 huda: And do you think like this is good in the 10th activity place? Or should I move it higher than one of them? 79 00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.279 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine that it's typical. 80 00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:52.359 huda: Okay. And for the women in games. This one should I like explain? Like I feel like I shouldn't. But like the what the initiative is like. 81 00:15:52.757 --> 00:15:56.030 huda: Over here, like the same way I did with empowering AI. 82 00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.730 Jenny Duan: I feel like 83 00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.830 Jenny Duan: I don't think you should. I think it looks good the way it is. 84 00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.610 huda: Okay? 85 00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.707 huda: Because, like, I could say something like an international organization, 86 00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:20.500 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to do that. I don't think you need to, because if they search up women in games like, I think it's pretty like. I think it's pretty clearly limited. 87 00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.160 huda: Okay? 88 00:16:25.308 --> 00:16:26.820 huda: Then, yeah, I think 89 00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.570 huda: I think activities are set 90 00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.410 huda: great. 91 00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.570 Jenny Duan: Okay. 92 00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.030 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay. I think you can submit Stanford tonight, or whenever you're ready. 93 00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.850 huda: Yeah, I think I want to submit it tonight. 94 00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:52.250 Jenny Duan: See you. Okay. Exciting, exciting. Yeah, I'm so proud of you. That's like, that's awesome. 95 00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.320 huda: Thanks. 96 00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:53.970 Jenny Duan: Oh. 97 00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.789 Jenny Duan: do you have any? Did you get a chance to look over your Usc. Essays? 98 00:17:00.078 --> 00:17:15.670 huda: He says that like he's a bit like busy right now, so he's not able to said like he spent most of the time like looking at the Stanford essay, so I don't think he'll have time to look at the Usc. Essays. But actually, I did have a question about that. 99 00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:21.879 huda: So on the essays, the 1st one, which is like 100 00:17:22.248 --> 00:17:24.690 huda: kind of like the Y major essay. 101 00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.580 huda: I kind of talk about English language development. 102 00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:37.745 huda: and like how games kind of connected me to like wanting to engage in volunteer services and impact my community. 103 00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:55.239 huda: and down here. The the national like game. Grant grand challenges thing. You mentioned that I should like do like a like the introduction should be about eld, so I was wondering if, like repeating that might like 104 00:17:55.943 --> 00:18:01.060 huda: might have like a negative effect, because, like, I feel like I talk about it for 2 of the essays. So. 105 00:18:03.345 --> 00:18:08.959 Jenny Duan: So you 1st talk about it and describe like the Y major. Where do you? Where else do you talk about it? 106 00:18:09.974 --> 00:18:18.789 huda: The last essay here. I didn't actually write the show yet, but that was like where I was. Gonna start it like with the hook and everything with the personal connection. 107 00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.000 Jenny Duan: Oh, 108 00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:29.680 Jenny Duan: I see. I think you should only mention it in one place not to you're right about that. 109 00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:35.970 Jenny Duan: Is there another like situation that you feel like could be applicable here that you would write about instead. 110 00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.090 huda: I think, like 111 00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.920 huda: I think 112 00:18:41.020 --> 00:19:02.429 huda: this can apply to like Sunday School volunteer. I don't know if I mentioned that already in the other essays. But that's also like a time when I was teaching like young children, and I saw, like some of them, like fidgeting, and then like having to create like a card game for them as well to like kind of take in the information in different ways. 113 00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.559 huda: So I think that's like a really similar example, I guess. 114 00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:12.980 Jenny Duan: I think that that sounds really good. Is there like a specific scene that you would put your reader into 115 00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.100 Jenny Duan: like what's happening there. 116 00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.780 huda: I mean, like I could like you kind of 117 00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:40.030 huda: use like bits of that one like excerpt that I wrote about like the expo marker, and then, like like not people, or like the children, not like really paying attention to the lesson, but then, like when I like, gamified it and turned it into like, I guess, like, instead of this time, instead of like the expo marker, I can talk about like 118 00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.019 huda: like a card game, because that's more like relevant to the question. So 119 00:19:45.621 --> 00:19:51.138 huda: yeah, maybe like the same scene of like, like, noisy children. 120 00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.850 huda: like. 121 00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.420 huda: yeah. 122 00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.750 huda: Yes. 123 00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.380 Jenny Duan: I think that that sounds that sounds good. 124 00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.499 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that 125 00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.720 Jenny Duan: I think that that seems like a good start. I think also like. 126 00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.063 Jenny Duan: if you 127 00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.549 Jenny Duan: as long as you, I think as long as you make it 128 00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.859 Jenny Duan: specific scene, and you just ensure that it's like not too broad, and you're putting the reader in like a very specific mode. 129 00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.090 Jenny Duan: Fine! 130 00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.400 Jenny Duan: That should be good. 131 00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.230 huda: Yeah, I just pasted in like. 132 00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.810 Jenny Duan: Here we go. 133 00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.919 Jenny Duan: I think this is good like this. 134 00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.640 Jenny Duan: How many words you might have a couple of weeks left! 135 00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.330 Jenny Duan: You have 75 words. 136 00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.544 huda: Oh, okay, that's a lot. 137 00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.139 huda: Oh, yeah, actually, 138 00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:18.950 huda: I got a message from, like, I don't know if this means anything. But I got a message from the like Usc Viterbi school of engineering like counselor. I think. 139 00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.740 huda: It was like 140 00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:34.709 huda: it was just like a personal message. She just said that like like reminded about like the deadline. And then that she saw that like I had a return. Be like 1st choice, Major, so I don't know if that's a good sign, but. 141 00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:42.260 Jenny Duan: Wait. Was it? How personalized was it like? Was it an email that they blast everyone? Or was it like an email to you? I mean it's fine. If it's either. 142 00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.200 huda: It was a message. 143 00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.350 huda: I just like let me see the exact thing that she sent. 144 00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.820 Jenny Duan: It might just be an email blast, but like, still you should, you should. 145 00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.870 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think this is just like a generic message. But I think, like. 146 00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.570 Jenny Duan: still, like you should. 147 00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.160 Jenny Duan: it's like, it's like encouraging to hear that. Regardless. 148 00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.409 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 149 00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.324 Jenny Duan: Okay, 150 00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:23.070 huda: In this for the 75 words I can possibly like, maybe elaborate more about like 151 00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.110 huda: instead of instead of here. I can like 152 00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.529 huda: focus, kind of explain more about like how 153 00:22:31.844 --> 00:22:34.679 huda: like it can be molded in different ways. 154 00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.840 huda: like. 155 00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.269 huda: I don't know, like, maybe. 156 00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.909 huda: like card games and stuff like that. 157 00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.609 huda: and okay. 158 00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:58.229 Jenny Duan: I feel like you don't necessarily need to spend too much more on context. If, as long as you write more about yourself, let me think about where would be the best place to fit in more information. What are you thinking. 159 00:22:59.397 --> 00:23:08.252 huda: Do you think like after this, I can talk about like how I solve this problem of like having, like these squirming kids at the local mosque. 160 00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.339 huda: like here. After that I can say, like, I crafted like a card game. 161 00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:15.780 huda: Okay. 162 00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.530 Jenny Duan: You can put that here. 163 00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.540 huda: oh, yes. 164 00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.999 huda: I don't know if this is a word, actually. But 165 00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.519 huda: actually, I don't know, if this is too. 166 00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.860 huda: like 167 00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.010 huda: broad, the second sentence. 168 00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.529 Jenny Duan: Maybe, instead of pillars of our religion like, are there specific 169 00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.060 Jenny Duan: principles, stories, or anything that you can write. 170 00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.280 huda: yeah, maybe like this story of. 171 00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.070 huda: And 172 00:26:05.874 --> 00:26:08.310 huda: do you know, like, if there's any like 173 00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:17.990 huda: similes that I can use to illustrate like their 1 80 degree turn of like. How they were unconcentrated, and they just suddenly became engaged. 174 00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.800 huda: I could just say, like, let go of 1 80. 175 00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.566 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think this is a bit 176 00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.719 Jenny Duan: cliche. I wouldn't say like a 1 80 degree turn. 177 00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:21.000 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say like slowly or like. Quickly, I watch as the students 178 00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:27.529 Jenny Duan: became focused on, like solving the problems through this way, or focused on memorizing the 179 00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:36.289 Jenny Duan: passages through the game or focus on talking to each. I watch as the students become became immersed in something. You know. 180 00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.240 huda: Does this make sense. 181 00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.159 Jenny Duan: This sounds like chat, gpt. 182 00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.240 huda: Oh! 183 00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:22.660 Jenny Duan: Like instead of let's let's be specific. 184 00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.690 Jenny Duan: In the intricacies of this really quickly. I watched as the students became 185 00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.629 Jenny Duan: immersed in the. 186 00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.370 huda: Maybe, like students fueled by their 187 00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.610 huda: competitiveness. 188 00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:23.769 huda: Blurred it out. 189 00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 190 00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.880 huda: Parts of the story. 191 00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.000 huda: Maybe. 192 00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.290 Jenny Duan: Okay? 193 00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.989 Jenny Duan: And 194 00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.879 Jenny Duan: is there. I think you say storage place here. So I'm wondering if there's another one. 195 00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.720 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 196 00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.760 huda: Bustle, maybe. 197 00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.840 huda: Yeah. 198 00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:06.170 huda: But and then this one might be a little generic. It isn't about the content. 199 00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.640 huda: What about 200 00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.259 huda: leveraging different learning styles. 201 00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.750 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 202 00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.090 Jenny Duan: Maybe I wouldn't 203 00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.990 Jenny Duan: take and take this out. 204 00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.750 Jenny Duan: Maybe they like one weekend. 205 00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.730 Jenny Duan: How old are these kids. 206 00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.930 huda: They're like, 207 00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.030 huda: second graders. 208 00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:36.920 Jenny Duan: I think maybe something we can emphasize here is like how they were newly re-energized, or how they were. 209 00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.820 Jenny Duan: etcetera, something like that 210 00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.600 Jenny Duan: or something. 211 00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.660 Jenny Duan: No. 212 00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.239 huda: And then what was this? Comment again. 213 00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.585 Jenny Duan: Oh. 214 00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.479 Jenny Duan: okay, I'm just gonna pop that I don't remember when I put that for 215 00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.620 Jenny Duan: you still have about 40 words left. 216 00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:09.059 Jenny Duan: Is that a lesson? Is there cause you say lesson plan here. So did you say, like story whiteboard projector, or something like that? 217 00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.990 huda: Yeah, the whiteboard, I guess. 218 00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.910 huda: Maybe like, similarly over here. 219 00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.459 huda: So it's like a smoother transition. 220 00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.960 Jenny Duan: I think it. Maybe it doesn't make sense to say I've seen firsthand 221 00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:37.249 Jenny Duan: because you you introduce the concept of gamified education in this paragraph. It doesn't quite make sense for you to write about it like here. 222 00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.660 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can move this here. 223 00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.880 huda: Hmm. 224 00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.869 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure about this transition. 225 00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.864 huda: Yeah. 226 00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.060 Jenny Duan: I don't think. 227 00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.440 huda: That. 228 00:34:54.449 --> 00:35:00.009 Jenny Duan: It would be a good transition here, because you've already introduced it in this paragraph. 229 00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.269 huda: Oh, wait so like 230 00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.020 huda: the whole synth, like bringing up synthoria like, do you think that needs to be. 231 00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.349 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think Judas should definitely bring up Somethoria. 232 00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.880 huda: Okay, then wait. Why does the sentence not match here? 233 00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:32.890 Jenny Duan: Because 234 00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:42.870 Jenny Duan: okay, wait. Actually, I think it might be fine. But I guess the only thing that was just catching you was like, I feel like you 235 00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:49.869 Jenny Duan: emphasize how games. Actually, I think it's fine, because here you, you write where you've seen it. And then 236 00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.620 Jenny Duan: this is a transition referring to here. 237 00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.199 huda: Yeah, I think I also kind of 238 00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:02.121 huda: sentence here when I'm talking about like my relatives with Adhd 239 00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:20.350 huda: And then I talk about like how they thrive through interactive and engaging learning. And then, I say, I guess, like, that's like how I see it firsthand. And then I talk about how like that inspired me to create synthoria. But yeah, I don't know if it comes off that way. 240 00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.100 Jenny Duan: I think I think that's fine, though. 241 00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:17.380 Jenny Duan: Okay, we have 40 words. What do you feel like is missing here? 242 00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.839 Jenny Duan: Maybe we can connect this more to engineering like, how do you? 243 00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:36.500 Jenny Duan: I think right here you have the opportunity to write about like how the engineering mindset, or how the school of 244 00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:49.500 Jenny Duan: how the school of Engineering can support this. Because I feel like you talk a lot about this about like personalized learning. But you don't talk about like problem solving, or anything that's associated with 245 00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.260 Jenny Duan: personalizing. 246 00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.305 huda: Yeah. 247 00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.089 Jenny Duan: So maybe you can use the last 40 words to write about how like 248 00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.190 Jenny Duan: this relates to engineering 249 00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.540 Jenny Duan: or the or the engineering mindset for engineering challenges. 250 00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.889 huda: So I think 251 00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:16.135 huda: I think I'll write it like before this sentence, because I feel like this is like a good concluding sentence, so we might. I can say, like, 252 00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.190 huda: like 253 00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.040 huda: technology. This is just like a random draft. But 254 00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.500 huda: no, I guess. 255 00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.650 huda: Hmm! 256 00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:18.399 huda: How do I? I was, gonna say, something like like technology, like, there's innovation and technology every day. But so often we leave out this like factor of like how our innovation can benefit education. 257 00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.050 huda: Do you think that's like a good 258 00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.699 huda: like kind of stance to it? Or. 259 00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.890 Jenny Duan: I think so. 260 00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.750 Jenny Duan: Okay. 261 00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.930 Jenny Duan: where would you put that like here at the beginning or at the end. 262 00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.930 huda: I think before this 263 00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.700 Jenny Duan: Before. Okay. 264 00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.710 Jenny Duan: I don't know if I would write this beginning, maybe just say through engineering. 265 00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.289 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would say, engineering 266 00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:07.620 Jenny Duan: creates. 267 00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.470 Jenny Duan: And there's opportunities 268 00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.820 Jenny Duan: engineering 269 00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.120 Jenny Duan: to design spaces. 270 00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.990 huda: Knowledgeable world. 271 00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.200 huda: Informed world. 272 00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:27.310 huda: yeah. 273 00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.790 Jenny Duan: What else does engineering teacher tell you? 274 00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.000 huda: Wait! What was that? 275 00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.750 Jenny Duan: What else does engineering either teach or tell you? 276 00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.909 huda: Well, engineering like I guess 277 00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.740 huda: it gives you like, I guess, like a platform to make 278 00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.939 huda: things. And so 279 00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.799 huda: like that should be used for 280 00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.060 huda: like. 281 00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:02.819 huda: I guess I feel like I always say this. But like teaching others. And also. 282 00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.326 huda: I guess 283 00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:24.870 huda: maybe like programming and building a world where anyone can 284 00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.359 huda: where everyone has equal access to education. 285 00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.640 huda: like, yeah. Like. 286 00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.550 huda: maybe. 287 00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.815 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 288 00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:46.770 Jenny Duan: what else about engineering? Specifically as a discipline stands out versus like the social sciences or the humanities. 289 00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:53.611 huda: Because, like with engineering, you can actually create products. And you can create, like, 290 00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.520 huda: I guess different 291 00:42:56.251 --> 00:43:03.620 huda: tools through engineering like, whether that be through video games or maybe like different 292 00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.234 huda: like machines in terms of engineering. 293 00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.419 huda: like, like, you can create 294 00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:16.260 huda: products that that can actually reach people. I guess. 295 00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.749 Jenny Duan: Okay and and 296 00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:22.710 Jenny Duan: and 297 00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:27.779 Jenny Duan: and this is when you design spaces for a more inclusive, informed world. 298 00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.040 Jenny Duan: Bye. 299 00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:38.380 Jenny Duan: maybe you like, write one more sentence about like with this mindset, with this 300 00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:46.000 Jenny Duan: mindset at the forefront like, how do you hope to make a difference like you can say, like, I hope to Xyz. 301 00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:24.979 huda: Is this too basic. 302 00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.619 huda: And I feel like it kind of restates.

If, like, do you think, this is complete. 376 00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.849 Jenny Duan: I think the 1st essay looks good. 377 00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:41.430 huda: Oh! 378 00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.620 Jenny Duan: And then the short ones look good, too. 379 00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:51.163 Jenny Duan: the short ones. I don't think you should put too much pressure onto them, because, like they're so short. 380 00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:57.069 huda: Yeah. And I think we finalized them like a while ago. So I think 381 00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:59.480 huda: I think it's fine. Yeah. 382 00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:01.150 Jenny Duan: Okay. 383 00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:14.619 huda: Okay, then. I think that's like all the Usc essays. Then I guess I'll be ready to submit that 384 00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.339 huda: today as well. 385 00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.310 Jenny Duan: 9 386 00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:20.073 Jenny Duan: awesome. 387 00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:26.079 Jenny Duan: So the next step is the Uc essays. Is that. 388 00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:31.046 huda: Yeah, I think there's also the uiuc essays. 389 00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:37.979 huda: let me share this with you. I answered the 1st question, but they're like, fairly like 390 00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:44.030 huda: I can use, like my other essays, to help me. So 391 00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:51.049 huda: they're not terrible, I guess. And then but I did write like a new draft for the 1st one, which is like 392 00:52:51.110 --> 00:53:04.309 huda: an experience that you've had in the past 3 to 4 years, and I feel like this. One's a little more like straightforward than the other supplementals. So it was, yeah, it was a little different. And yeah, I don't know if I like this draft. But 393 00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:06.690 huda: yeah. 394 00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.360 Jenny Duan: Can you put a link to those essays 395 00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:12.889 Jenny Duan: in to the chat? 396 00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:15.740 Jenny Duan: Oh, I already see it. Never mind. Thank you so much. 397 00:53:16.606 --> 00:53:18.590 Jenny Duan: Okay?

I know you wrote this yourself, but this looks like Chat gpt. 402 00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:41.930 huda: Rules. 403 00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:49.079 Jenny Duan: I don't know why this like sentence structure what truly captivate. But it wasn't of just the networking potential of the platform. 404 00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.790 Jenny Duan: I think maybe we change this sentence. 405 00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.690 huda: Yeah. 406 00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:59.549 huda: I I don't know why I wrote this so. 407 00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.300 huda: I know. 408 00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.800 Jenny Duan: I know. I know you wrote it. I know you wrote it, but it looks like chat. 409 00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:07.360 huda: Hmm! 410 00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.030 huda: Maybe, like the project 411 00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:28.280 huda: offer more than a networking potential. 412 00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:46.100 huda: Each index told a story with their experience carefully visualized through data. 413 00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:19.469 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can emphasize instead of while reviewing submissions. You can say, like 414 00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:24.130 Jenny Duan: one submission that stood out was key code. Sorry 415 00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.010 Jenny Duan: among the submissions I received 416 00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:28.210 Jenny Duan: like 417 00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.559 Jenny Duan: he could put out to you for some reason, because 418 00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:35.749 Jenny Duan: I think I came across G. Codes. It seems 419 00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:37.070 Jenny Duan: a little bit 420 00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:44.109 Jenny Duan: passive like I wouldn't necessarily understand that she codes is like upon the 1st read. I didn't understand that she codes was something that came 421 00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:45.780 Jenny Duan: from the hackathon. 422 00:55:52.516 --> 00:55:54.250 huda: So like I can say 423 00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.510 huda: from all the 424 00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.240 huda: from all submissions 425 00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.040 huda: one particularly 426 00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:05.870 huda: stood out to me. 427 00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.759 huda: Okay, what other parts of this are kind of like 428 00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:42.550 huda: not really. 429 00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:43.819 huda: I guess. 430 00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:50.109 Jenny Duan: I feel like this. This essay is like, it's good, it's not bad, but it's boring. 431 00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.689 Jenny Duan: That's how I feel like I feel like it's 432 00:56:52.950 --> 00:57:00.789 Jenny Duan: maybe you could spend. You have the room to spend like one sentence at the beginning, laying a bit more context about the essay and like. 433 00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:06.099 Jenny Duan: why like, why did you found empower accounts? How does this connect to other things that you're working on like 434 00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:10.090 Jenny Duan: I feel like you have the room to write a little bit more about it. 435 00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:11.680 huda: Yeah. 436 00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.339 Jenny Duan: Like one sentence of context. 437 00:57:16.352 --> 00:57:20.677 huda: Should I focus on like, what like data, or like 438 00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.970 huda: or like wanting to provide like resources for 439 00:57:26.005 --> 00:57:27.790 huda: free resources to 440 00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.720 huda: like girls are 441 00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:33.100 huda: like. I don't know what what kind of angle should I take it at. 442 00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:35.285 Jenny Duan: Actually 443 00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:54.929 Jenny Duan: let me think about this because I feel like you don't. It's 150. This is actually fine. I think if it's so straightforward because you have 150 words. It's not 250, and you're already 28 words over. So I think actually, maybe it's fine if you just do it straightforward because you don't. I don't think the questions may be designed for a story. 444 00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.509 Jenny Duan: Those short in terms of the responses. 445 00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.700 Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna take away that sentence. 446 00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:38.580 Jenny Duan: I think now you should be at the word, count. I think this looks good to me. 447 00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:40.870 huda: Okay. 448 00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:47.840 Jenny Duan: What do you think? 449 00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:49.780 huda: Yeah. 450 00:58:52.260 --> 00:59:01.309 huda: I don't know if I should. Should I include this like part then about like she codes, because I don't know if it like. Adds to like 451 00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:05.859 huda: the story that that like data, can tell stories. 452 00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:13.210 Jenny Duan: I think we should shorten this part, and then elaborate more on. Why she codes is important. 453 00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:14.710 huda: Hmm. 454 00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:32.639 Jenny Duan: Like. Why? Why is she codes 455 00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:36.209 Jenny Duan: important or different? 456 00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:51.949 huda: It's because, like with, they Co, they didn't just collect like their names and contact information. They actually like collected, like all their details about like kind of the struggles that they went through. And they use that 457 00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:57.849 huda: that and like and that's why why I found it like really unique, because 458 00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:59.429 huda: like. 459 00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.299 huda: it was more than just like showing like context. It was like about like 460 01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.349 huda: showing how there's like other women going through the same struggles as you, and stuff like that. 461 01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:16.850 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm not sure if this 462 01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.699 Jenny Duan: 2 sentences makes. 463 01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 464 01:00:24.713 --> 01:00:36.549 huda: Yeah, I think I wrote it kind of weird. But what I meant is like, like, just to provide like an example of like a statistic that we use like, for example, that I use, like. 465 01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:53.780 huda: realize the story like, realize how data can be helpful. Like, for example. I saw that, like our average of like the average skill level of like the people that enrolled in our hackathon was like 5.6. So we decided to do some more like 466 01:00:53.780 --> 01:01:12.049 huda: workshops that were more aligned to like people with that skill level and so like it helped me like, understand, like, what can I do to be a better organizer, and like I use it to my advantage rather than I feel like. The wording is really strange. But yeah, that's what I. 467 01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.500 Jenny Duan: I think maybe we changed the wording, too. 468 01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:37.849 Jenny Duan: I think the sentence is also a repetition of this 1st sentence, so I feel like we could change this. 469 01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:41.190 huda: Hmm, yeah. 470 01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:54.800 Jenny Duan: I think this this detail, maybe, is not relevant to the rest of the story or the rest of the article. 471 01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:14.699 huda: Then, like, I'm just trying to connect it back to myself, because the 1st part is, I guess, like I'm like viewing someone else's project. But I kind of also wanted to show how like one of my own projects had to do with like data and like 472 01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:17.339 huda: understanding the world through data. 473 01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:27.999 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say something, did you? Did you survey the people afterwards to see if their comfort, comfort, level with coding or interest, or anything has increased over time. 474 01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.309 huda: Oh, no, I haven't. 475 01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's fine. 476 01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.279 Jenny Duan: let's see. 477 01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:40.929 Jenny Duan: And then, as a platform to tell stories. 478 01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.940 Jenny Duan: maybe you say, like 479 01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.439 Jenny Duan: something like data alone. 480 01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:02.199 Jenny Duan: data like, I'm gonna say this in like rough English. And then we can pare it down like data alone doesn't tell you 481 01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.629 Jenny Duan: like anything about your participants stories like, just because they rated themselves. 482 01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:15.070 Jenny Duan: 5 out of 10 doesn't mean that doesn't signal like their interest or their like willingness to learn or anything. So maybe you can say something like 483 01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:22.880 Jenny Duan: data alone doesn't reveal, like someone's personal stories or background, like data alone is insufficient without like. 484 01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:24.680 Jenny Duan: I don't know 485 01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:28.279 Jenny Duan: more information about the person. And then you can write about how like. 486 01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:31.330 Jenny Duan: while you were crafting the workshops, do you notice that 487 01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:33.360 Jenny Duan: the pre-survey had, like 488 01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:44.059 Jenny Duan: comfort levels of 5 out of 10 or feel levels of 5 out of 10, and then you had to adjust it. I I think. Okay, I understand now. Sorry, saying that out loud. Help me understand what you're trying to say. I think it's just like 489 01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.180 Jenny Duan: a matter of rephrasing it. 490 01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:47.690 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 491 01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.850 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. 492 01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:50.505 huda: Yeah, 493 01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.600 huda: yeah, we can reword this 494 01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:46.480 huda: Hmm. 495 01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:23.784 huda: i don't, yeah, I feel, like, I don't like my wording, for this, 496 01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:28.740 huda: alright. 497 01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:32.530 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this like specific thing relates to telling stories at all. 498 01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:39.599 Jenny Duan: I think maybe it would be better to if you wanted to include that detail, you could include it here like before this one submission part. 499 01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:43.017 Jenny Duan: I think, instead, what might be more effective is 500 01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:47.090 Jenny Duan: writing about how like 501 01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.650 Jenny Duan: like 502 01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.980 Jenny Duan: like before when you were 503 01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.390 Jenny Duan: like the 504 01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:57.610 Jenny Duan: no. 505 01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:04.360 Jenny Duan: the data helped. You see, like your that your potential applicants, as instead of numbers, you saw them as like 506 01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:21.209 Jenny Duan: people like like you know how like a data is a collection of bits and stuff. And like, when people fill out your application form like it helps transform, like their basic information into, like the people that are there building apps and like talking to each other. So you can see how like, maybe you can say something like, how like 507 01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:36.499 Jenny Duan: 40, like 2 per that 2% application rate from, I'm just gonna say, Canada, like it manifested in like this team of 3 girls that like built the school app for like this like demographic, like, 20% of 508 01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:51.610 Jenny Duan: 20% middle schoolers like you watch that they like brought like their I don't know Middle school humor into like a website they built, or something about how like, when you look at data. It's just a demographic. But then, you see that reflected in like the teams of people, and like the ideas that they had 509 01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.670 Jenny Duan: during it. 510 01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:53.970 Jenny Duan: what do you think. 511 01:06:54.650 --> 01:07:13.663 huda: Yeah, I really like that. And I think it like perfectly translates into like the theme of how like data can like tell stories. And I think also, like with the with, like the research I did on like the major. It's pretty similar to like what they do. So yeah, I think I'll I'll try writing that 512 01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:15.683 huda: over here. 513 01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:21.060 huda: like, after I kind of introduce into the next paragraph. 514 01:07:21.541 --> 01:07:24.140 huda: Yeah, I'll try. I'll try writing that. 515 01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:37.270 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. Okay, I have to hop to my next call. But I think this is like really good start. I think that the second essay, like you've kind of got this, I think. The 3rd essay. You've also got this. 516 01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.790 huda: Okay. Thank you. 517 01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:47.500 Jenny Duan: Yeah, we should schedule our next meeting, though. When are you free tomorrow? Because I know, like we have a November 1st deadline.

I'll try to get the drafts done by tomorrow. And I'll send them asynchronously, maybe, and like. 523 01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:14.080 Jenny Duan: Okay. 524 01:08:14.785 --> 01:08:15.490 huda: Yeah. 525 01:08:16.609 --> 01:08:18.699 Jenny Duan: Okay, then, Wednesday, we can maybe do like 526 01:08:19.339 --> 01:08:21.309 Jenny Duan: 8, 30. Does that work. 527 01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:22.680 huda: Yeah. 528 01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.460 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Okay. 529 01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:29.879 Jenny Duan: is this your only other early thing? Or do you have another school? I think this is your only. 530 01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:31.950 huda: This is my only other early action. 531 01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.899 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is fine. Then.

How's it going. 2 00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.899 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.620 Jenny Duan: Doing that, too? Yeah. How is? How's your weekend been? What have you been up to? 4 00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.920 huda: It's been pretty I guess. 5 00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:54.969 huda: Kind of relaxed, I guess. I mean, I've been like working on my essays and everything. But I feel like it's been a lot like less stressful than the past few weeks. So yeah. 6 00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.440 huda: not too bad. 7 00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:12.188 Jenny Duan: That's good to hear. Yeah, I've loved seeing your progress so far. I feel like it's everything's going really good for jcamp. I think that keeping it as an Ec. Is nice, because then you get the opportunity to write about it, which I feel like you wouldn't get if you were 8 00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.870 Jenny Duan: doing like 9 00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.299 Jenny Duan: it as an award. What do you think. 10 00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.319 huda: Yeah, yeah, I think I realize that. And I guess maybe like the podcast. Club isn't as important. 11 00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I agree, especially since you haven't been involved with it for too long. 12 00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.260 Jenny Duan: cool. So I think maybe we can start by just 13 00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.079 Jenny Duan: looking at your Stanford supplements. I saw that you went over some revisions. 14 00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.890 Jenny Duan: If we could walk through those. 15 00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.500 Jenny Duan: how does that sound. 16 00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.449 huda: Yeah, that sounds good. 17 00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.659 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! 18 00:07:50.060 --> 00:08:09.360 huda: Yeah. Okay. So with the what this is like, the why you at Stanford, I say, so I did kind of l",
    "ike a pretty like large change, so I kind of got rid of the whole like. I'll be a storyteller. I'll be like a coding leader, and I kind of changed that so that 19 00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:26.389 huda: it reflects like the improvising innovator. Better. So like, I kind of like proposed a problem. And then, or like, I kind of set a problem. And then I proposed kind of like what my solution to that is, and how I'll leverage like Stanford to help me like 20 00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:47.180 huda: to solve that, I guess. Like, for example, the 1st one I talk about like how I'll use the Braden storytelling Grant to kind of help like the mainstream narrative like lack of Indian Muslim representation. And so like, yeah, I just kind of changed the format. So I guess there's still kind of like 2 different paragraphs. 21 00:08:47.700 --> 00:09:04.939 huda: Like this one's about storytelling, and this one's about coding. But like it's just not as like super separated, I guess. And then because of that. I also to shorten like this section. Which is about like the saffron improvisation. 22 00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.980 huda: so yeah, I had to like shorten that. 23 00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:15.750 huda: And then, oh, yeah, and also like my dad. He read over it, and he felt like I repeated sunbucks 2 times. 24 00:09:16.086 --> 00:09:23.799 huda: And I think the other time was in the additional information, and he said it might sound like a buzzer word or something like that. 25 00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.399 Jenny Duan: Okay, that makes sense. I like what you did here with the change. 26 00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.830 Jenny Duan: I feel like. 27 00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:51.280 Jenny Duan: yeah, I feel like, this is, I feel like this is good. I like how you made these parts more specific. I think, right here, just this last sentence of this paragraph, when traditional algorithms fail diverse learners. I'll build, adapt, study buddies. I feel like this could also be a little bit more specific. 28",
    " 00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.160 huda: Maybe instead of out, I can just say, like something like 29 00:09:56.713 --> 00:10:02.750 huda: like about education, like when traditional lesson plans fail, diverse learners. Maybe. 30 00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.490 Jenny Duan: That's good. Yeah. 31 00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.600 huda: Or can I just do lessons. 32 00:10:20.023 --> 00:10:23.430 Jenny Duan: I think lessons is good. Yeah, I don't think we need to sprite plan. 33 00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.610 Jenny Duan: alright, I think this is good. How many words is this. 34 00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:46.410 huda: This is 2, 51. So I have to get rid of one word. 35 00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.450 Jenny Duan: Okay. 36 00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:29.670 huda: Also does this wording when Ml. Models ignore cultural nuances. Do you think that makes sense. 37 00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.419 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. Yes. 38 00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.530 huda: Okay. 39 00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.940 huda: maybe I can get rid of like voicing them here. 40 00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.819 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think voicing. Get rid of voicing them, and then 41 00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.540 Jenny Duan: think that should be exactly 2 50 words. 42 00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.310 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect. 43 00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.120 huda: Hey? 44 00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.539 huda: I think that's all of them finalized. Then I think. 45 00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:32.359 Jenny Duan: Yeah, can I? We look at your your activities list just one more time. Or did you change anything else? Because did you take out J. Cam, and put it back in, or did you just not take it out? In the 1st place. 46 00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.639 huda: I did change it. 47 00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.850 huda: Yeah, I didn't change it. Wait, let me just open up like how it looks like on the common app. 48 00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:53.539 huda: Because I did add, like the the lines to separate them, because I realized, like with the Unc. Appli",
    "cation, it looked like really kind of confusing, especially when it ended up, ended with like a capital letter. 49 00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:55.900 huda: Let me share my screen 50 00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.079 huda: so it'll look like oh, wait! 51 00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.000 huda: I think 52 00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.120 huda: I'm not sure why, but 53 00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.760 huda: there's no space after Google here. I'll just do this. 54 00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.380 Jenny Duan: I mean, you sent me this. Okay, this looks good. 55 00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.279 Jenny Duan: Your your extracurriculars are really strong. 56 00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.909 huda: Thank you. 57 00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.700 huda: Yeah. I think I didn't really get rid of much. I just like 58 00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.260 huda: I just had to like, remove spaces and stuff some places. 59 00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:55.400 huda: But yeah, I think I think that's oh, yeah, actually, my dad was wondering for the last one for independent. Over here. 60 00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:09.289 huda: he thought. This last bit compete in college hackathons was a little vague. And he thought that like, for example, cruise hacks is one of them that I went to so he thought, if I should just like name, drop that. 61 00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.889 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that looks good, do you have? If you have word, count? 62 00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.010 Jenny Duan: I mean, how many, how many hackathons have you been to. 63 00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.630 huda: Maybe like 15. 64 00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:37.499 Jenny Duan: Oh, maybe like college Hackathon would be good in that case, because I feel like, if you're specific, like, I think they'll get the point, because if you're too vague, then 65 00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.340 Jenny Duan: I mean, if you choose specific, then it won't show the key. 66 00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.230 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say you've been competed in 15 college hackathons, and you can spare 2 more",
    " characters. 67 00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.950 huda: Okay, this is like. 68 00:14:49.753 --> 00:14:51.370 huda: the limit at the limit. 69 00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.640 Jenny Duan: Oh! 70 00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.710 huda: Like. I even had to get rid of the. 71 00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:03.339 Jenny Duan: Can you take? Can you take post pandemic? You just write pandemic unemployment 72 00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.810 Jenny Duan: and then add 15 73 00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.340 Jenny Duan: number. 74 00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.359 Jenny Duan: There you go. 75 00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.270 huda: Okay. 76 00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.420 huda: I'm in 9th grade as well. 77 00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.280 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great. 78 00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:28.130 huda: And do you think like this is good in the 10th activity place? Or should I move it higher than one of them? 79 00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.279 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine that it's typical. 80 00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:52.359 huda: Okay. And for the women in games. This one should I like explain? Like I feel like I shouldn't. But like the what the initiative is like. 81 00:15:52.757 --> 00:15:56.030 huda: Over here, like the same way I did with empowering AI. 82 00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.730 Jenny Duan: I feel like 83 00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.830 Jenny Duan: I don't think you should. I think it looks good the way it is. 84 00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.610 huda: Okay? 85 00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.707 huda: Because, like, I could say something like an international organization, 86 00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:20.500 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to do that. I don't think you need to, because if they search up women in games like, I think it's pretty like. I think it's pretty clearly limited. 87 00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.160 huda: Okay? 88 00:16:25.308 --> 00:16:26.820 huda: Then, yeah, I think 89 00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.570 huda: I think activities are set 90 00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.410 huda: great. 91 00:16:33.410 --> 0",
    "0:16:34.570 Jenny Duan: Okay. 92 00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.030 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay. I think you can submit Stanford tonight, or whenever you're ready. 93 00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.850 huda: Yeah, I think I want to submit it tonight. 94 00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:52.250 Jenny Duan: See you. Okay. Exciting, exciting. Yeah, I'm so proud of you. That's like, that's awesome. 95 00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.320 huda: Thanks. 96 00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:53.970 Jenny Duan: Oh. 97 00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.789 Jenny Duan: do you have any? Did you get a chance to look over your Usc. Essays? 98 00:17:00.078 --> 00:17:15.670 huda: He says that like he's a bit like busy right now, so he's not able to said like he spent most of the time like looking at the Stanford essay, so I don't think he'll have time to look at the Usc. Essays. But actually, I did have a question about that. 99 00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:21.879 huda: So on the essays, the 1st one, which is like 100 00:17:22.248 --> 00:17:24.690 huda: kind of like the Y major essay. 101 00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.580 huda: I kind of talk about English language development. 102 00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:37.745 huda: and like how games kind of connected me to like wanting to engage in volunteer services and impact my community. 103 00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:55.239 huda: and down here. The the national like game. Grant grand challenges thing. You mentioned that I should like do like a like the introduction should be about eld, so I was wondering if, like repeating that might like 104 00:17:55.943 --> 00:18:01.060 huda: might have like a negative effect, because, like, I feel like I talk about it for 2 of the essays. So. 105 00:18:03.345 --> 00:18:08.959 Jenny Duan: So you 1st talk about it and describe like the Y major. Where do you? Where else do you talk about it? 106 00:18:09.974 --> 00:18:18.789 huda: The last essay here. I didn't actually write the show yet, but that was like where I was. Gonna start it like with the hook and everything with",
    " the personal connection. 107 00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.000 Jenny Duan: Oh, 108 00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:29.680 Jenny Duan: I see. I think you should only mention it in one place not to you're right about that. 109 00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:35.970 Jenny Duan: Is there another like situation that you feel like could be applicable here that you would write about instead. 110 00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.090 huda: I think, like 111 00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.920 huda: I think 112 00:18:41.020 --> 00:19:02.429 huda: this can apply to like Sunday School volunteer. I don't know if I mentioned that already in the other essays. But that's also like a time when I was teaching like young children, and I saw, like some of them, like fidgeting, and then like having to create like a card game for them as well to like kind of take in the information in different ways. 113 00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.559 huda: So I think that's like a really similar example, I guess. 114 00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:12.980 Jenny Duan: I think that that sounds really good. Is there like a specific scene that you would put your reader into 115 00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.100 Jenny Duan: like what's happening there. 116 00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.780 huda: I mean, like I could like you kind of 117 00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:40.030 huda: use like bits of that one like excerpt that I wrote about like the expo marker, and then, like like not people, or like the children, not like really paying attention to the lesson, but then, like when I like, gamified it and turned it into like, I guess, like, instead of this time, instead of like the expo marker, I can talk about like 118 00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.019 huda: like a card game, because that's more like relevant to the question. So 119 00:19:45.621 --> 00:19:51.138 huda: yeah, maybe like the same scene of like, like, noisy children. 120 00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.850 huda: like. 121 00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.420 huda: yeah. 122 00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.750 huda: Yes. 123 00:19",
    ":58.130 --> 00:20:00.380 Jenny Duan: I think that that sounds that sounds good. 124 00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.499 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that 125 00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.720 Jenny Duan: I think that that seems like a good start. I think also like. 126 00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.063 Jenny Duan: if you 127 00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.549 Jenny Duan: as long as you, I think as long as you make it 128 00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.859 Jenny Duan: specific scene, and you just ensure that it's like not too broad, and you're putting the reader in like a very specific mode. 129 00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.090 Jenny Duan: Fine! 130 00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.400 Jenny Duan: That should be good. 131 00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.230 huda: Yeah, I just pasted in like. 132 00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.810 Jenny Duan: Here we go. 133 00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.919 Jenny Duan: I think this is good like this. 134 00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.640 Jenny Duan: How many words you might have a couple of weeks left! 135 00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.330 Jenny Duan: You have 75 words. 136 00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.544 huda: Oh, okay, that's a lot. 137 00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.139 huda: Oh, yeah, actually, 138 00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:18.950 huda: I got a message from, like, I don't know if this means anything. But I got a message from the like Usc Viterbi school of engineering like counselor. I think. 139 00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.740 huda: It was like 140 00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:34.709 huda: it was just like a personal message. She just said that like like reminded about like the deadline. And then that she saw that like I had a return. Be like 1st choice, Major, so I don't know if that's a good sign, but. 141 00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:42.260 Jenny Duan: Wait. Was it? How personalized was it like? Was it an email that they blast everyone? Or was it like an email to you? I mean it's fine. If it's either. 142 00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.200 huda: It was a message. 143 00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.350 huda: I just like",
    " let me see the exact thing that she sent. 144 00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.820 Jenny Duan: It might just be an email blast, but like, still you should, you should. 145 00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.870 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think this is just like a generic message. But I think, like. 146 00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.570 Jenny Duan: still, like you should. 147 00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.160 Jenny Duan: it's like, it's like encouraging to hear that. Regardless. 148 00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.409 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 149 00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.324 Jenny Duan: Okay, 150 00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:23.070 huda: In this for the 75 words I can possibly like, maybe elaborate more about like 151 00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.110 huda: instead of instead of here. I can like 152 00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.529 huda: focus, kind of explain more about like how 153 00:22:31.844 --> 00:22:34.679 huda: like it can be molded in different ways. 154 00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.840 huda: like. 155 00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.269 huda: I don't know, like, maybe. 156 00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.909 huda: like card games and stuff like that. 157 00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.609 huda: and okay. 158 00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:58.229 Jenny Duan: I feel like you don't necessarily need to spend too much more on context. If, as long as you write more about yourself, let me think about where would be the best place to fit in more information. What are you thinking. 159 00:22:59.397 --> 00:23:08.252 huda: Do you think like after this, I can talk about like how I solve this problem of like having, like these squirming kids at the local mosque. 160 00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.339 huda: like here. After that I can say, like, I crafted like a card game. 161 00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:15.780 huda: Okay. 162 00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.530 Jenny Duan: You can put that here. 163 00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.540 huda: oh, yes. 164 00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.999 huda: I don't know if this is a word, actually. But 165 00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.519 huda:",
    " actually, I don't know, if this is too. 166 00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.860 huda: like 167 00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.010 huda: broad, the second sentence. 168 00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.529 Jenny Duan: Maybe, instead of pillars of our religion like, are there specific 169 00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.060 Jenny Duan: principles, stories, or anything that you can write. 170 00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.280 huda: yeah, maybe like this story of. 171 00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.070 huda: And 172 00:26:05.874 --> 00:26:08.310 huda: do you know, like, if there's any like 173 00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:17.990 huda: similes that I can use to illustrate like their 1 80 degree turn of like. How they were unconcentrated, and they just suddenly became engaged. 174 00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.800 huda: I could just say, like, let go of 1 80. 175 00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.566 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think this is a bit 176 00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.719 Jenny Duan: cliche. I wouldn't say like a 1 80 degree turn. 177 00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:21.000 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say like slowly or like. Quickly, I watch as the students 178 00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:27.529 Jenny Duan: became focused on, like solving the problems through this way, or focused on memorizing the 179 00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:36.289 Jenny Duan: passages through the game or focus on talking to each. I watch as the students become became immersed in something. You know. 180 00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.240 huda: Does this make sense. 181 00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.159 Jenny Duan: This sounds like chat, gpt. 182 00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.240 huda: Oh! 183 00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:22.660 Jenny Duan: Like instead of let's let's be specific. 184 00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.690 Jenny Duan: In the intricacies of this really quickly. I watched as the students became 185 00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.629 Jenny Duan: immersed in the. 186 00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.370 huda: Maybe, like students fueled by their 187 00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.610 huda: competitivene",

I think you say storage place here. So I'm wondering if there's another one. 195 00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.720 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 196 00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.760 huda: Bustle, maybe. 197 00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.840 huda: Yeah. 198 00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:06.170 huda: But and then this one might be a little generic. It isn't about the content. 199 00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.640 huda: What about 200 00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.259 huda: leveraging different learning styles. 201 00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.750 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 202 00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.090 Jenny Duan: Maybe I wouldn't 203 00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.990 Jenny Duan: take and take this out. 204 00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.750 Jenny Duan: Maybe they like one weekend. 205 00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.730 Jenny Duan: How old are these kids. 206 00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.930 huda: They're like, 207 00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.030 huda: second graders. 208 00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:36.920 Jenny Duan: I think maybe something we can emphasize here is like how they were newly re-energized, or how they were. 209 00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.820 Jenny Duan: etcetera, something like that 210 00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.600 Jenny Duan: or something. 211 00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.660 Jenny Duan: No. 212 00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.239 huda: And then what was this? Comment again. 213 00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.585 Jenny Duan: Oh. 214 00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.479 Jenny Duan: okay, I'm just gonna pop that I don't remember when I put that for 215 00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.620 Jenny Duan: you still have about 40 words left. 216 00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:09.059 Jenny D",

So did you say, like story whiteboard projector, or something like that? 217 00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.990 huda: Yeah, the whiteboard, I guess. 218 00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.910 huda: Maybe like, similarly over here. 219 00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.459 huda: So it's like a smoother transition. 220 00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.960 Jenny Duan: I think it. Maybe it doesn't make sense to say I've seen firsthand 221 00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:37.249 Jenny Duan: because you you introduce the concept of gamified education in this paragraph. It doesn't quite make sense for you to write about it like here. 222 00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.660 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can move this here. 223 00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.880 huda: Hmm. 224 00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.869 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure about this transition. 225 00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.864 huda: Yeah. 226 00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.060 Jenny Duan: I don't think. 227 00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.440 huda: That. 228 00:34:54.449 --> 00:35:00.009 Jenny Duan: It would be a good transition here, because you've already introduced it in this paragraph. 229 00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.269 huda: Oh, wait so like 230 00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.020 huda: the whole synth, like bringing up synthoria like, do you think that needs to be. 231 00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.349 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think Judas should definitely bring up Somethoria. 232 00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.880 huda: Okay, then wait. Why does the sentence not match here? 233 00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:32.890 Jenny Duan: Because 234 00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:42.870 Jenny Duan: okay, wait. Actually, I think it might be fine. But I guess the only thing that was just catching you was like, I feel like you 235 00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:49.869 Jenny Duan: emphasize how games. Actually, I think it's fine, because here you, you write where you've seen it. And then 236 00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.620 Jenny Duan: this is a transition referring to here. 2",
    "37 00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.199 huda: Yeah, I think I also kind of 238 00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:02.121 huda: sentence here when I'm talking about like my relatives with Adhd 239 00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:20.350 huda: And then I talk about like how they thrive through interactive and engaging learning. And then, I say, I guess, like, that's like how I see it firsthand. And then I talk about how like that inspired me to create synthoria. But yeah, I don't know if it comes off that way. 240 00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.100 Jenny Duan: I think I think that's fine, though. 241 00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:17.380 Jenny Duan: Okay, we have 40 words. What do you feel like is missing here? 242 00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.839 Jenny Duan: Maybe we can connect this more to engineering like, how do you? 243 00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:36.500 Jenny Duan: I think right here you have the opportunity to write about like how the engineering mindset, or how the school of 244 00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:49.500 Jenny Duan: how the school of Engineering can support this. Because I feel like you talk a lot about this about like personalized learning. But you don't talk about like problem solving, or anything that's associated with 245 00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.260 Jenny Duan: personalizing. 246 00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.305 huda: Yeah. 247 00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.089 Jenny Duan: So maybe you can use the last 40 words to write about how like 248 00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.190 Jenny Duan: this relates to engineering 249 00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.540 Jenny Duan: or the or the engineering mindset for engineering challenges. 250 00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.889 huda: So I think 251 00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:16.135 huda: I think I'll write it like before this sentence, because I feel like this is like a good concluding sentence, so we might. I can say, like, 252 00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.190 huda: like 253 00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.040 huda: technology. This is just like a random draft. But 254 00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.500",
    " huda: no, I guess. 255 00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.650 huda: Hmm! 256 00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:18.399 huda: How do I? I was, gonna say, something like like technology, like, there's innovation and technology every day. But so often we leave out this like factor of like how our innovation can benefit education. 257 00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.050 huda: Do you think that's like a good 258 00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.699 huda: like kind of stance to it? Or. 259 00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.890 Jenny Duan: I think so. 260 00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.750 Jenny Duan: Okay. 261 00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.930 Jenny Duan: where would you put that like here at the beginning or at the end. 262 00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.930 huda: I think before this 263 00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.700 Jenny Duan: Before. Okay. 264 00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.710 Jenny Duan: I don't know if I would write this beginning, maybe just say through engineering. 265 00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.289 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would say, engineering 266 00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:07.620 Jenny Duan: creates. 267 00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.470 Jenny Duan: And there's opportunities 268 00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.820 Jenny Duan: engineering 269 00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.120 Jenny Duan: to design spaces. 270 00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.990 huda: Knowledgeable world. 271 00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.200 huda: Informed world. 272 00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:27.310 huda: yeah. 273 00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.790 Jenny Duan: What else does engineering teacher tell you? 274 00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.000 huda: Wait! What was that? 275 00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.750 Jenny Duan: What else does engineering either teach or tell you? 276 00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.909 huda: Well, engineering like I guess 277 00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.740 huda: it gives you like, I guess, like a platform to make 278 00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.939 huda: things. And so 279 00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.799 huda: like that should be used for 280 00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.060 huda: like. 281 ",
    "00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:02.819 huda: I guess I feel like I always say this. But like teaching others. And also. 282 00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.326 huda: I guess 283 00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:24.870 huda: maybe like programming and building a world where anyone can 284 00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.359 huda: where everyone has equal access to education. 285 00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.640 huda: like, yeah. Like. 286 00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.550 huda: maybe. 287 00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.815 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 288 00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:46.770 Jenny Duan: what else about engineering? Specifically as a discipline stands out versus like the social sciences or the humanities. 289 00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:53.611 huda: Because, like with engineering, you can actually create products. And you can create, like, 290 00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.520 huda: I guess different 291 00:42:56.251 --> 00:43:03.620 huda: tools through engineering like, whether that be through video games or maybe like different 292 00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.234 huda: like machines in terms of engineering. 293 00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.419 huda: like, like, you can create 294 00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:16.260 huda: products that that can actually reach people. I guess. 295 00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.749 Jenny Duan: Okay and and 296 00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:22.710 Jenny Duan: and 297 00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:27.779 Jenny Duan: and this is when you design spaces for a more inclusive, informed world. 298 00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.040 Jenny Duan: Bye. 299 00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:38.380 Jenny Duan: maybe you like, write one more sentence about like with this mindset, with this 300 00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:46.000 Jenny Duan: mindset at the forefront like, how do you hope to make a difference like you can say, like, I hope to Xyz. 301 00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:24.979 huda: Is this too basic. 302 00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.619 huda: And I feel like it kind of restates. The last sentence. 303 00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.939 Jenny Duan: I think m",

But 317 00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:50.429 huda: yeah, I think problem solving and creative thinking 318 00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:53.020 huda: almost relevant. 319 00:45:59.010 --> 00:45:59.990 huda: Maybe like. 320 00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.730 huda: I hope to leverage 321 00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.660 huda: the engineering mindset. 322 00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.870 huda: Maybe like. 323 00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.030 huda: I don't know if this 324 00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.230 huda: sentence might work. 325 00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:58.459 Jenny Duan: Great, great, great 326 00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.110 Jenny Duan: leveraging, my newly learned problem solving and creatives 327 00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:03.920 Jenny Duan: thinking skills. 328 00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.959 Jenny Duan: Maybe we just change this into one sentence because I don't know if you have enough 329 00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.400 Jenny Duan: words. 330 00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.840 huda: And maybe I should say, like and leverage. 331 00:47:21.160 -",

I answered the 1st question, but they're like, fairly like 390 00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:44.030 huda: I can use, like my other essays, to help me. So 391 00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:51.049 huda: they're not terrible, I guess. And then but I did write like a new draft for the 1st one, which is like 392 00:52:51.110 --> 00:53:04.309 huda: an experience that you've had in the past 3 to 4 years, and I feel like this. One's a little more like straightforward than the other supplementals. So it was, yeah, it was a little different. And yeah, I don't know if I like this draft.

    "ssions 425 00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.040 huda: one particularly 426 00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:05.870 huda: stood out to me. 427 00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.759 huda: Okay, what other parts of this are kind of like 428 00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:42.550 huda: not really. 429 00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:43.819 huda: I guess. 430 00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:50.109 Jenny Duan: I feel like this. This essay is like, it's good, it's not bad, but it's boring. 431 00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.689 Jenny Duan: That's how I feel like I feel like it's 432 00:56:52.950 --> 00:57:00.789 Jenny Duan: maybe you could spend. You have the room to spend like one sentence at the beginning, laying a bit more context about the essay and like. 433 00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:06.099 Jenny Duan: why like, why did you found empower accounts? How does this connect to other things that you're working on like 434 00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:10.090 Jenny Duan: I feel like you have the room to write a little bit more about it. 435 00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:11.680 huda: Yeah. 436 00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.339 Jenny Duan: Like one sentence of context. 437 00:57:16.352 --> 00:57:20.677 huda: Should I focus on like, what like data, or like 438 00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.970 huda: or like wanting to provide like resources for 439 00:57:26.005 --> 00:57:27.790 huda: free resources to 440 00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.720 huda: like girls are 441 00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:33.100 huda: like. I don't know what what kind of angle should I take it at. 442 00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:35.285 Jenny Duan: Actually 443 00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:54.929 Jenny Duan: let me think about this because I feel like you don't. It's 150. This is actually fine. I think if it's so straightforward because you have 150 words. It's not 250, and you're already 28 words over. So I think actually, maybe it's fine if you just do it straightforward because you don't. I don't think the questions may be designed for a story. 444 00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.509 Jenny Duan: Those short in te",
    "rms of the responses. 445 00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.700 Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna take away that sentence. 446 00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:38.580 Jenny Duan: I think now you should be at the word, count. I think this looks good to me. 447 00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:40.870 huda: Okay. 448 00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:47.840 Jenny Duan: What do you think? 449 00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:49.780 huda: Yeah. 450 00:58:52.260 --> 00:59:01.309 huda: I don't know if I should. Should I include this like part then about like she codes, because I don't know if it like. Adds to like 451 00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:05.859 huda: the story that that like data, can tell stories. 452 00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:13.210 Jenny Duan: I think we should shorten this part, and then elaborate more on. Why she codes is important. 453 00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:14.710 huda: Hmm. 454 00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:32.639 Jenny Duan: Like. Why? Why is she codes 455 00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:36.209 Jenny Duan: important or different? 456 00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:51.949 huda: It's because, like with, they Co, they didn't just collect like their names and contact information. They actually like collected, like all their details about like kind of the struggles that they went through. And they use that 457 00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:57.849 huda: that and like and that's why why I found it like really unique, because 458 00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:59.429 huda: like. 459 00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.299 huda: it was more than just like showing like context. It was like about like 460 01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.349 huda: showing how there's like other women going through the same struggles as you, and stuff like that. 461 01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:16.850 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm not sure if this 462 01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.699 Jenny Duan: 2 sentences makes. 463 01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 464 01:00:24.713 --> 01:00:36.549 huda: Yeah, I think I wrote it kind of weird. But what I meant is like, like, just to provide like an example of like a st",
    "atistic that we use like, for example, that I use, like. 465 01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:53.780 huda: realize the story like, realize how data can be helpful. Like, for example. I saw that, like our average of like the average skill level of like the people that enrolled in our hackathon was like 5.6. So we decided to do some more like 466 01:00:53.780 --> 01:01:12.049 huda: workshops that were more aligned to like people with that skill level and so like it helped me like, understand, like, what can I do to be a better organizer, and like I use it to my advantage rather than I feel like. The wording is really strange. But yeah, that's what I. 467 01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.500 Jenny Duan: I think maybe we changed the wording, too. 468 01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:37.849 Jenny Duan: I think the sentence is also a repetition of this 1st sentence, so I feel like we could change this. 469 01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:41.190 huda: Hmm, yeah. 470 01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:54.800 Jenny Duan: I think this this detail, maybe, is not relevant to the rest of the story or the rest of the article. 471 01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:14.699 huda: Then, like, I'm just trying to connect it back to myself, because the 1st part is, I guess, like I'm like viewing someone else's project. But I kind of also wanted to show how like one of my own projects had to do with like data and like 472 01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:17.339 huda: understanding the world through data. 473 01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:27.999 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say something, did you? Did you survey the people afterwards to see if their comfort, comfort, level with coding or interest, or anything has increased over time. 474 01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.309 huda: Oh, no, I haven't. 475 01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's fine. 476 01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.279 Jenny Duan: let's see. 477 01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:40.929 Jenny Duan: And then, as a platform to tell stories. 478 01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.940 Jenny Duan: maybe you say, like 479 0",
    "1:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.439 Jenny Duan: something like data alone. 480 01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:02.199 Jenny Duan: data like, I'm gonna say this in like rough English. And then we can pare it down like data alone doesn't tell you 481 01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.629 Jenny Duan: like anything about your participants stories like, just because they rated themselves. 482 01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:15.070 Jenny Duan: 5 out of 10 doesn't mean that doesn't signal like their interest or their like willingness to learn or anything. So maybe you can say something like 483 01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:22.880 Jenny Duan: data alone doesn't reveal, like someone's personal stories or background, like data alone is insufficient without like. 484 01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:24.680 Jenny Duan: I don't know 485 01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:28.279 Jenny Duan: more information about the person. And then you can write about how like. 486 01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:31.330 Jenny Duan: while you were crafting the workshops, do you notice that 487 01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:33.360 Jenny Duan: the pre-survey had, like 488 01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:44.059 Jenny Duan: comfort levels of 5 out of 10 or feel levels of 5 out of 10, and then you had to adjust it. I I think. Okay, I understand now. Sorry, saying that out loud. Help me understand what you're trying to say. I think it's just like 489 01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.180 Jenny Duan: a matter of rephrasing it. 490 01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:47.690 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 491 01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.850 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. 492 01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:50.505 huda: Yeah, 493 01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.600 huda: yeah, we can reword this 494 01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:46.480 huda: Hmm. 495 01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:23.784 huda: i don't, yeah, I feel, like, I don't like my wording, for this, 496 01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:28.740 huda: alright. 497 01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:32.530 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this like specific thing relates to telling stories at all. 498 01:05:32.800 --> 01:05",
    ":39.599 Jenny Duan: I think maybe it would be better to if you wanted to include that detail, you could include it here like before this one submission part. 499 01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:43.017 Jenny Duan: I think, instead, what might be more effective is 500 01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:47.090 Jenny Duan: writing about how like 501 01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.650 Jenny Duan: like 502 01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.980 Jenny Duan: like before when you were 503 01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.390 Jenny Duan: like the 504 01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:57.610 Jenny Duan: no. 505 01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:04.360 Jenny Duan: the data helped. You see, like your that your potential applicants, as instead of numbers, you saw them as like 506 01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:21.209 Jenny Duan: people like like you know how like a data is a collection of bits and stuff. And like, when people fill out your application form like it helps transform, like their basic information into, like the people that are there building apps and like talking to each other. So you can see how like, maybe you can say something like, how like 507 01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:36.499 Jenny Duan: 40, like 2 per that 2% application rate from, I'm just gonna say, Canada, like it manifested in like this team of 3 girls that like built the school app for like this like demographic, like, 20% of 508 01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:51.610 Jenny Duan: 20% middle schoolers like you watch that they like brought like their I don't know Middle school humor into like a website they built, or something about how like, when you look at data. It's just a demographic. But then, you see that reflected in like the teams of people, and like the ideas that they had 509 01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.670 Jenny Duan: during it. 510 01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:53.970 Jenny Duan: what do you think. 511 01:06:54.650 --> 01:07:13.663 huda: Yeah, I really like that. And I think it like perfectly translates into like the theme of how like data can like tell stories. And I think also, like w",
    "ith the with, like the research I did on like the major. It's pretty similar to like what they do. So yeah, I think I'll I'll try writing that 512 01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:15.683 huda: over here. 513 01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:21.060 huda: like, after I kind of introduce into the next paragraph. 514 01:07:21.541 --> 01:07:24.140 huda: Yeah, I'll try. I'll try writing that. 515 01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:37.270 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. Okay, I have to hop to my next call. But I think this is like really good start. I think that the second essay, like you've kind of got this, I think. The 3rd essay. You've also got this. 516 01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.790 huda: Okay. Thank you. 517 01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:47.500 Jenny Duan: Yeah, we should schedule our next meeting, though. When are you free tomorrow? Because I know, like we have a November 1st deadline. So I'd like to. 518 01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.910 Jenny Duan: I'd like to see this as soon as we can. 519 01:07:51.935 --> 01:07:56.195 huda: Yeah, I I think actually, tomorrow I might be a little busy. 520 01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.230 huda: is Wednesday fun? 521 01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:03.340 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's fine as long as you're fine with it, being so close to the deadline. 522 01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:13.670 huda: Yeah, I I can like, okay, I'll send. I'll try to get the drafts done by tomorrow. And I'll send them asynchronously, maybe, and like. 523 01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:14.080 Jenny Duan: Okay. 524 01:08:14.785 --> 01:08:15.490 huda: Yeah. 525 01:08:16.609 --> 01:08:18.699 Jenny Duan: Okay, then, Wednesday, we can maybe do like 526 01:08:19.339 --> 01:08:21.309 Jenny Duan: 8, 30. Does that work. 527 01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:22.680 huda: Yeah. 528 01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.460 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Okay. 529 01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:29.879 Jenny Duan: is this your only other early thing? Or do you have another school? I think this is your only. 530 01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:31.950 huda: This is my only other early ac",
    "tion. 531 01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.899 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is fine. Then. Yeah, I'll see you on Wednesday and send send me those asynchronously whenever you finish. 532 01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.460 huda: Okay, yeah. 533 01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:42.200 huda: thank you. 534 01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:42.940 Jenny Duan: Take care bye."
