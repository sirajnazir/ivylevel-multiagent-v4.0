How's it going. 2 00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.310 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:47.400 Jenny Duan: Doing? Well, it's good to see you again. And yeah, what's I mean? I know we just met yesterday. So I mean, is there any? Are there any updates from yesterday? If not, we can kind of just like jump into things, but would love to hear if there's anything new. 4 00:11:48.356 --> 00:12:02.200 huda: I'm basically done with my application to the Muslim youth North, or North America. I think it was called that one like I'm almost done. I had to answer like one more essay, I think. But 5 00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:07.492 huda: yeah, I don't think I don't think it's like that serious. But I was able to like update like my 6 00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:14.199 huda: I was able to like upload like a few like pictures and videos that I've done so that like, maybe they know a little bit about like 7 00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.410 huda: what my skills are. But yeah. 8 00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.810 Jenny Duan: You wanna share? What's the easiest way for us to look at that 9 00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.608 Jenny Duan: like? Would that be 10 00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.269 Jenny Duan: And do you wanna share your screen to share that link with me. What's the best. 11 00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.551 huda: I can share my screen. 12 00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:41.530 huda: so I think I just had to add some like information. And then here I talked about like 13 00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:59.630 huda: my experience with like the media arts and then student use. And then Filmmakers club. And then I talked about like getting recognized regionally for one of our short films. And then I also talked about like in my free time, I like to do like photography and phone cinematic videos. 14 00:12:59.975 --> 00:13:09.139 huda: And I talked about I talked about like my social media like on my other account. I call like 2 50 K views. But I think that's like. 15 00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:29.179 huda: yeah, I just use as a metric. But and then here, I didn't fill this out yet. But I was gonna talk about like how I wanna I wanna make like this organization more like accessible to more people. Cause I I feel like I didn't hear about it until, like you kind of told me so. If like, we build our social media presence more and as well as like 16 00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:38.070 huda: kind of doing a lot more publicity for like the different camps and everything, and making appealing for people that's like what I would like to do. And then 17 00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:57.145 huda: here, maybe, like I can talk about like I could like, maybe even like talk into specifics about like how like visualization is gonna be like important for like people or like art is gonna be like important for like people to like know what they're getting into if they're sending up for camps and everything and 18 00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:20.210 huda: And so like the best way to like kind of visualize them through art is kind of like creating stuff that is true to like our beliefs and everything but we still have to like appeal to more people to join and make it like a safe space, and then like art, and like photography and stuff, and that that could be like a good tool for that. That's that's what I want to say here. 19 00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.459 huda: And then this last one I want to talk about like 20 00:14:23.911 --> 00:14:41.749 huda: how like photography and videography has been like my platform of storytelling like, I've also game developer. So I like storytelling in general. But I'm like photography and videography has been like kind of like a platform for me to use that, I think. And then 21 00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.252 huda: here are like 22 00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.740 huda: I don't know why they're not loading right now, but 23 00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.130 huda: I did like a bunch of pictures from London that I took on my shot on my camera. 24 00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.930 Jenny Duan: Incense. 25 00:14:53.900 --> 00:15:13.369 huda: I don't know they're not loading, and then I put you as I put you, as like a reference. And then for the question I just said like, well, like the style, and like the pictures, there's like a little bit like nostalgic slash, warm. But I'm willing to like. I'll try different editing styles that based off of m. 1 a's needs. But yeah. 26 00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Can I see the photos that you took. 27 00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.930 huda: Yeah, I don't know like they're not loading, but I think 28 00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.370 huda: I could be like. 29 00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.340 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's okay. I don't know if, like, maybe the file size is too big or something's up. 30 00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.215 huda: No, I could share some. I think I could. We could look at some. 31 00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.790 Jenny Duan: I wanna make sure that it's visible on their end. 32 00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.214 huda: Yeah, 33 00:15:39.094 --> 00:15:44.959 huda: they were showing up earlier before, like, I think of a refresher might work. But I don't know if, like, the progress will go away. 34 00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.590 huda: Pardon. 35 00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.870 huda: Yeah. 36 00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.950 huda: let me just like, try 37 00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.040 huda: try refreshing, maybe slides. 38 00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.359 huda: I'll just see the website. 39 00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.050 huda: Oh, okay, wait. Then I'll have. I'll I'll do it again, I think, but after. 40 00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.279 Jenny Duan: Okay. No worries. 41 00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.840 huda: But yeah, that's kind of like what I did for 42 00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.100 huda: like the application. Yeah. 43 00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.770 Jenny Duan: I'm cool. 44 00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.710 huda: Is there anything else like I can show for that? But. 45 00:16:55.303 --> 00:16:56.550 Jenny Duan: I think 46 00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:03.090 Jenny Duan: that sounds that looks good to me. I think whenever you're ready you should just be able to submit it. Are you waiting on anything. 47 00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:10.600 huda: No, I think I just. I just need like a little more time to like finish, like the answer answer with questions and everything. But 48 00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.560 huda: yeah. 49 00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.019 Jenny Duan: So what else like? What do you mean by that? Like? What else do you have to do. 50 00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.569 huda: yeah, like, I was like, I just didn't get to finish all the answers. Yeah, I was like. 51 00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:22.869 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I am. 52 00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.699 huda: Yeah, like, I was just like working on like some summer homework stuff. But 53 00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:27.799 huda: yeah. 54 00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.710 Jenny Duan: Totally okay. Awesome. 55 00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.260 Jenny Duan: cool. So, okay, other than that. Do you have any other updates? 56 00:17:37.965 --> 00:17:41.670 huda: Not really. I don't think I have any updates since the last time. 57 00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:59.937 Jenny Duan: Okay, I I was thinking today we could spend some time talking through like the common app prompts. And like, now that we're approaching August. I think it's about time to like start writing your common app in your early application. So yeah, have you? We've looked at the common app prompts, and I know that you've written this for English. 58 00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.280 Jenny Duan: Do you feel like particularly drawn towards any of the prompts that you wanted 59 00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.250 Jenny Duan: 2. 60 00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.140 huda: Aye. 61 00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.580 huda: I think I'll have to take a look again. I don't remember. I think I 62 00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.680 huda: yeah, I don't remember. I feel like I chose one, and then I I forgot. But 63 00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:28.115 huda: I think probably obstacles like I think I wanna talk about like 64 00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.759 huda: like an obstacle that I faced. 65 00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.719 huda: But then again, like I don't know. 66 00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:44.638 huda: like I feel like other people that are choosing that the like kind of obstacle like prompt might have, like, not bigger, like problems. But like, I feel like more 67 00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.040 huda: I guess 68 00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:53.800 huda: larger problems than the kind that I would write about like being like discreet as like a woman in stem and everything. I think that would be like a little 69 00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.085 huda: right about. So maybe not. The obstacles prompt. 70 00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.191 huda: these are. It's kinda hard to choose. But 71 00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.130 huda: maybe a topic idea or concept 72 00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.730 huda: I find engaging and makes me lose track of 73 00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.860 huda: time. 74 00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.310 huda: I feel like that could be interesting. 75 00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.520 huda: Yeah, do you. 76 00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.470 Jenny Duan: Wanna talk like? What are you thinking? Gaming like? 77 00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.460 Jenny Duan: What Field do you think is. 78 00:19:32.794 --> 00:19:39.145 huda: There's like different, like, different, like ways. I can write about it like, I could either write about like, 79 00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.700 huda: like. 80 00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:52.180 huda: okay, so this is kind of like general right? Because, like, since we're since, I'm like applying to like different colleges with like different majors. This kind of carts are right by like one thing, but like 81 00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.129 huda: either, like the lack of like represent media representation. 82 00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:12.620 huda: For like for like and like, why that matters like just not just because you want to see someone on the screen, but because of like learning, diverse perspectives like, that's something that's I'm like, really passionate about. And I definitely like, think about that a lot. 83 00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.510 huda: And then other that, or maybe 84 00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.520 huda: like. 85 00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.560 huda: yeah, I could do something about gaming. And I could like 86 00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.879 huda: right about like how like the gaming culture like how it's 87 00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.780 huda: like maybe, like 88 00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.019 huda: pretty detrimental or not detrimental. But 89 00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:47.419 huda: oh, I could also like, I think, one diverse like perspective that I have is like as like a Muslim and like, I'm like, I play a lot of games that are like like valorant and fortnite and stuff, and sometimes, like I have to feel like a little bit. 90 00:20:48.195 --> 00:21:01.720 huda: I have to feel like a little bit kind of skeptical, or like cautious when I'm playing those things and like and like, or maybe if I wanted to select stream or be like A Youtuber or something, I must think about that a little bit, cause it feels like if you're a Muslim 91 00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:13.150 huda: representing like Muslims, I feel like. And then also, it's like there's a very violent stereotype for Muslims. And that's like something I've thought about, because. 92 00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:24.479 huda: yeah, like my parents like stopped me from playing like Ga violent games because they thought it was like too violent or anything but a lot of people haven't like had that experience. 93 00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.430 huda: And so like. 94 00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.390 Jenny Duan: Like up. 95 00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.343 huda: Just like. 96 00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.560 huda: why is it violent for some people not violent for some people, I think 97 00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.859 huda: that might be 98 00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.300 huda: like a good thing to write about. 99 00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.680 huda: Yeah. 100 00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.340 Jenny Duan: Hunt. 101 00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.980 huda: Yeah. 102 00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.730 Jenny Duan: Go ahead! 103 00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.449 huda: No, yeah, that was like all the ideas I had. 104 00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:47.070 Jenny Duan: Out of the ones that you've written so far, which one of the essays has been like the favorite. 105 00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.129 huda: Let me let me check with the common app like assignment that I had. 106 00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.430 huda: I wrote. Okay. So I wrote. 107 00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:21.223 huda: I think the one that I over J. Camp like about like which topic I'd really want to report on. And then I talked about like like the divide between like different, like like races and ethnicities within Islam, and that one was like one of my favorite essays that I've written 108 00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.710 huda: And there's also one. 109 00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:37.333 huda: I think, the other time. I don't really like the way I wrote it, for, like my assignment, but it was kind of like, still interesting, the the prompt which says to like, Reflect on a time where you challenged like a belief or idea, 110 00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:38.549 Jenny Duan: Talk about. 111 00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:46.029 huda: Like challenging, like, kind of how you're supposed to play Minecraft. And then I also related to like 112 00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.329 huda: how you're supposed to like learn like 113 00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.399 huda: computer science and stuff with like gaming and stuff. 114 00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.220 huda: So I think that could be that could be a good one to write about. 115 00:22:55.936 --> 00:22:59.270 huda: Those 2 are like my favorites. But yeah. 116 00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.211 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that. 117 00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:16.180 Jenny Duan: I think that what could be we could do right now is actually do some like storming exercises, because I think, what the best way to come up with your college essay topic is not really going from the prompt to your 118 00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.097 Jenny Duan: idea, but rather 119 00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:25.030 Jenny Duan: but rather like going from your essay to like matching it to a prompt. 120 00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.470 huda: Home. 121 00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.290 Jenny Duan: So what's popular is like 122 00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.910 Jenny Duan: starting off with. 123 00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.260 Jenny Duan: let's open a blank document. 124 00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.090 Jenny Duan: or we can do that in your notion. Actually 125 00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.800 Jenny Duan: let me open that 126 00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.707 Jenny Duan: So I'm on the personal statement. Tab 127 00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.000 Jenny Duan: make something cool. 128 00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.850 huda: Okay, I think I'm on that page now. 129 00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.340 Jenny Duan: You see this 130 00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.879 Jenny Duan: thing I need about brainstorming. 131 00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.449 huda: Yeah, I see that. 132 00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:20.809 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's open that.

Is that like? Is that too simple? Or like. 140 00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.050 Jenny Duan: No, that's that's that's exactly the type of thing could be anything like that. 141 00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.219 huda: go, this is so hard 142 00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.520 huda: a 143 00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.269 huda: I feel like, I don't know if this this is like also like 144 00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.280 huda: the home. 145 00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.870 huda: it's also like not really related to like the things that I've done, but like 146 00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:14.499 Jenny Duan: Even though it doesn't have to be. Really, it could be like anything like your favorite food, like what makes what makes you curious like if you have pink hair like me like anything random like that. 147 00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.610 Jenny Duan: Yes, awesome. 148 00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.992 huda: I don't know.

I think there's like another different one. So. 167 00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.779 Jenny Duan: Oh, what's the new game? 168 00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.230 huda: It's called nocturnal. 169 00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.060 Jenny Duan: Snore. 170 00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:44.729 huda: It's called like, I don't have rounds, but I think it's like mute has mute has zoom, or something like that. 171 00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.379 huda: It's like it was like 172 00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.140 huda: I played it like a little bit a while ago. But then I recently played it again. 173 00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.000 huda: And then, like, it's basically like a like a 174 00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.719 huda: like a soap opera. But like, it's like interactive, it's like. 175 00:30:59.955 --> 00:31:04.530 huda: it kind of like reminds me like the shows I grow up grew up with. 176 00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:06.610 Jenny Duan: Hello! Tell me more. 177 00:31:07.879 --> 00:31:27.939 huda: It's kinda like, it's like, okay. So it's kinda like sci-fi. So that like, there's like mutants, basically like, some of the characters aren't like human. There's like, one of the characters like like a cat. And then there's it's just like, not really like realistic, but like the characters are all like, really like real. 178 00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:28.650 huda: So 179 00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:54.089 huda: basically the kind of basic plot is that there's like this girl. She's kind of 18, I think, and she has. She's like she has like a single mom, and then like her grandpa like used to be like, live in the city. I think it's called. It's the name of the game and and like he knew, like all the people there, and like and then she goes back and she meets all the people 180 00:31:54.525 --> 00:32:03.980 huda: like, and he's kind of like getting sicker and stuff. But then, like she's like getting kind of acquainted with the like, the town and everything. And then there's like. 181 00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:22.983 huda: oh, kinda like lore to it. I don't really remember clearly, but it was like there's like scientists that like ruined the island or something, and then, like the grandpa saved it. So I don't know. It's like, really like interesting. It's like a basically like one of the shows that you kinda like would watch. But then it's like interactive and 182 00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:32.289 huda: like, I feel like it's also kind of like a modern twist on it like sci-fi, but then mixed with like kind of like us, like a 183 00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.750 huda: like a normal like soap opera that you'd like watch. But it's like. 184 00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.150 Jenny Duan: But like, what's the interactive part. 185 00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:46.469 huda: It's like you get to make like the decisions of, like what the girl does and like, how she interacts with, like the different 186 00:32:47.097 --> 00:32:50.579 huda: would like the different town town people. 187 00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.319 huda: and then, like that kind of like dictates, like the relationship at the end. So it's like. 188 00:32:55.870 --> 00:33:04.210 huda: like, do you end up like ruling the or not ruling, but like taking care of, like the island after, like the grandpa grandfather, like Pat. 189 00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.360 Jenny Duan: So that's kind of like 190 00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.549 Jenny Duan: that's kind of like animal crossing. 191 00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:15.089 huda: Kinda yeah, like, it's a little more like there's like a lot more story to it, though. 192 00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:23.269 Jenny Duan: Nice. That sounds really. So, yeah, put that down. That seems like like something really interesting that you could write about. 193 00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.505 huda: Yeah, 194 00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.230 huda: okay, what else? I? 195 00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.219 huda: I'm kind of stuck again. But I think I have like 16, 196 00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:32.429 huda: and then 197 00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:37.319 huda: and like, Wait, can you like, say, those ideas that you kind of gave 198 00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.443 huda: a couple minutes ago? 199 00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:43.780 huda: like, for example, that you said like favorite game. And they said 200 00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.860 huda: a like. 201 00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:53.020 Jenny Duan: So let's make it more. Let's let's make this more specific, like, instead of you enjoy fashion like what designers inspire you. What do you like about fashion? 202 00:34:56.559 --> 00:34:59.969 huda: I enjoy kind of 203 00:35:00.759 --> 00:35:07.389 huda: I like like, I don't have a specific like designer, but that I like. But I like like. 204 00:35:07.799 --> 00:35:15.559 huda: I really, I'm like, really a nostalgic person like. So I really like retro fashion. Like. 205 00:35:15.979 --> 00:35:18.429 huda: So I'm like, really nostalgic 206 00:35:19.429 --> 00:35:20.109 huda: and. 207 00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:20.720 Jenny Duan: May. 208 00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:25.730 Jenny Duan: What is retrofashion you like eighties, fashion nineties fashion. What does that look like? 209 00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:30.959 huda: Yeah, mainly like just 80, like, kind of like, 80 slash early nineties. 210 00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:36.019 Jenny Duan: Okay, then write. Write that down instead of you, like fashion. 211 00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:37.780 huda: Okay. 212 00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:47.420 huda: I like, I guess, like to be more specific. I like writing about 213 00:35:48.710 --> 00:36:01.519 huda: about like things that people haven't thought before, like like something that happens pretty commonly, and then like getting able to write something like that. I've noticed that people don't really talk about. 214 00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.230 huda: I like writing about that 215 00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.200 huda: I'm with you. 216 00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:21.860 Jenny Duan: Wait!

But like, are they like, usually. 218 00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.200 huda: what do I think? Mango. 219 00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:53.509 huda: I think, like, actually, like, like a really like big like Per. One of my personality. Traits, I think, should be like, separate from even like. The fashion thing is that I'm like really nostalgic 220 00:37:53.882 --> 00:38:05.809 huda: which I don't know. It's really a good because, like, I think colleges might want it to be like something in the future or something. But like, I feel like I'm always like thinking about like 221 00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:10.299 huda: I could like talk about like the past 4 h like especially 222 00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:26.859 huda: so like a specific thing is like, I got like like these earrings that belong to like my great grandmother. And it's just like I could like literally talk about like hours about like how she's probably worn these like since, like during like the British rule. 223 00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.819 Jenny Duan: Write write that down, then write that specific thing down. 224 00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.880 huda: But yeah. 225 00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:40.861 huda: and like, also about like how she how like things that she's done. 226 00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:53.259 huda: that she did wearing those earrings. So continue on today, like I still wear those earrings and eyes continue to do like parts for a culture. I think that's like really fascinating to me. 227 00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.590 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Why? Okay? 228 00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.690 Jenny Duan: So 229 00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.689 Jenny Duan: okay, that makes sense. 230 00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.260 Jenny Duan: this is so much better. 231 00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.930 Jenny Duan: So good. Well, he's your favorite music artist. 232 00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.460 Jenny Duan: not sure if he's sick, wise. 233 00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.540 huda: Really hard. 234 00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.900 huda: I don't know. I think it's it's like a hard to choose between 235 00:40:50.676 --> 00:40:52.886 huda: beba doobie and 236 00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:02.480 huda: I think I can do my top 3 not in order, but I can't see like my favorite artist. So either, like Frank Sinatra 237 00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.090 Jenny Duan: Moon. 238 00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:10.759 huda: Ruby or Billy Joel. I think any of those 3, and it's kind of like strange, because they're all from like really different time periods. 239 00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.619 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, write that down. 240 00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.230 Jenny Duan: Paul. 241 00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.630 Jenny Duan: Parallel. 242 00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.229 Jenny Duan: Okay.

I don't know what else to say. 245 00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:13.839 huda: Is it like 246 00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.989 huda: I like cats? Does that? Does that like count? 247 00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.309 huda: My favorite. 248 00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what's your type of cat? Yeah. 249 00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:16.800 Jenny Duan: Your parents are scared of cats. They like dogs better. 250 00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:27.771 huda: No, they don't like. They don't like cats or dogs like just they. They don't let us have like those type of animals. But then, like my mom was saying that once I go to college she's gonna get us a cat. 251 00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.089 Jenny Duan: What? Why, after you leave. 252 00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:33.430 huda: Just to taunt me, I guess. 253 00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.429 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, does it? We're like cats or something. 254 00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:44.340 huda: He's like me, like me and my sister like obsessed with cats. And then my brother's like like he. He's okay with them, like he doesn't really care. 255 00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:46.280 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 256 00:43:47.850 --> 00:44:02.900 huda: Yeah, I gotta sucks. But I think I think it's because, like, I feel like like all South Asian parents have, like kind of trauma from them, cause like at least for my mom, like there's like a dog that like chased her, and like almost bit her, because, like in like in South Asia. It's really 257 00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.090 huda: but like 258 00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.329 huda: stray dogs to be like evil.

And that's like, really like, like a really like large part of me. And 312 00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:08.870 huda: yeah, like. 313 00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:16.679 Jenny Duan: What does that mean? Like to be nostalgic like? I think you have to pass a lot like in your words. What does that? What does nostalgia mean to you? 314 00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:37.340 huda: I think nostalgia is like cause, like in kind of like, as humans like we kind of think of, like the past is kind of like a better time like sometimes we might have like worse times. But then, like as like someone kind of like thinking back like as someone who's like kind of nostalgic. I like thinking back on like kind of like the times where things were like 315 00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:43.929 huda: we're like kind of like in better conditions. And then maybe like taking steps to like kind of 316 00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.849 huda: going back in time and like like kind of doing things that 317 00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:54.200 huda: doing things that like I may have done in the past, or like people may have done the past. 318 00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.300 huda: Yeah. 319 00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.540 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So 320 00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:03.679 Jenny Duan: how can we weave that into story format? 321 00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.419 Jenny Duan: Is there a common theme within the nostalgia that you experience. 322 00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.839 Jenny Duan: Very thinking about a certain like type of memory, or 323 00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:18.690 Jenny Duan: I think I. 324 00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.440 huda: I think a lot of the time. 325 00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:24.480 huda: Maybe, like 326 00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:36.149 huda: I think, like historically, like as well, like, maybe not stuff that I have like that nostalgic for, but like kind of like thinking on the past about like, like, I'm really curious about like my ancestors 327 00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:43.380 huda: like, I'm almost thinking like, if my answers here like what would be they'd be thinking, or like and kind of like 328 00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:58.570 huda: like. For example, I think I kind of mentioned like about like my hair type. Like it's kind of like comes along with grandma, and so like I don't thinking like oh, like she looked like me when she's younger. But then again, I think I don't know if that's like the 329 00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.610 huda: really telling about me. So I don't know if, like. 330 00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.770 huda: that's something that we should focus on 331 00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:06.310 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 332 00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:09.330 huda: Yeah, like, I don't think they'll support. 333 00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.240 huda: Support me that much. 334 00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:14.980 Jenny Duan: Instinct. 335 00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.299 Jenny Duan: Is there? Has there been any experiences that have made you who you are? Do you think. 336 00:52:28.348 --> 00:52:31.070 huda: Like bad experiences, or like good experiences. 337 00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:32.310 Jenny Duan: Hi! There! 338 00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.719 huda: They've been like several, I think. 339 00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.699 huda: like one of them definitely being like the the few times like 340 00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.919 huda: I've felt like rejected from like the like. 341 00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.660 huda: My school kind of like not being 342 00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:55.819 huda: kind of that whole thing where, like I won't be able to be part of like the Msa. Or like, maybe, like the coding clubs. And then I'm learning from that is like. 343 00:52:55.930 --> 00:53:05.210 huda: kind of if you don't get what you want from like from like external like sources like, it's always better to create, like your own opportunities and like. 344 00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.849 huda: maybe even create opportunities for other people. 345 00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:15.280 huda: And that's something that I learned from that. And that kind of changed. How I thought of things cause I was like really fixated on, like, you know, getting like 346 00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:24.790 huda: leadership positions from someone else, or like, you know, that kind of like external validation. Maybe that like event really like, change me 347 00:53:31.185 --> 00:53:32.050 Jenny Duan: Cool. 348 00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.820 Jenny Duan: Let's think 349 00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:40.660 Jenny Duan: what else? 350 00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:45.430 Jenny Duan: I feel like we need to find something like pretty unique. 351 00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.420 Jenny Duan: maybe. What if you wrote like your life as a video game. 352 00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:50.810 huda: Never in the. 353 00:53:50.810 --> 00:54:00.090 Jenny Duan: Like, put your life into like the framework of a video game. So we make it sound like you're like playing a game. But like, you're like the main character in your own show. 354 00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:03.180 Jenny Duan: like what video games have taught you about life. You know. 355 00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.750 huda: Yeah, that sounds pretty interesting. 356 00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:15.210 Jenny Duan: I wonder like, how I feel like that's like a really good way to start off the essay. But, like, let me try to think about how you would like. Put the character in your world. 357 00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:25.889 huda: My my dad is showing me like an essay before where? It's I think it's like it was like in the format of like a Minecraft chat. 358 00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:37.689 huda: So like, it was like her, like experience, like online, like skepticism, and like kind of discrimination on Minecraft. And like, it was really cool, because it was like in the format of like Minecraft. 359 00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:43.619 huda: like text. So that was that was like something interesting from like the format that I could take away. 360 00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.479 huda: That's something similar like in a 361 00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.700 huda: game kind of way. But. 362 00:54:54.221 --> 00:54:58.150 Jenny Duan: How did that? Can you send me that essay? How did that essay describe it? 363 00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:00.760 huda: I don't have it right now. I'll 364 00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.080 huda: I could send it to you after this, maybe. But like 365 00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.190 huda: basically, they said, like, they basically like 366 00:55:07.906 --> 00:55:11.449 huda: like, let me put in the chat like, for example, like how they did like you said like. 367 00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:21.770 huda: and they actually like it was kind of like interesting, because the person actually said like a couple like 368 00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:29.420 huda: swear words and like slurs and stuff. And they're in the thing and their essay, which was confusing to me, but like 369 00:55:30.506 --> 00:55:38.100 huda: like, for example, like this is like how one of the things looked, and that's like how the the format of like Minecraft messages. 370 00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.380 Jenny Duan: Hello! 371 00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.600 Jenny Duan: What! What school did this person end up going to. 372 00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:44.630 huda: Stanford actually. 373 00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.890 Jenny Duan: Cool. So what if you did something like that? But like, obviously for different. But like. 374 00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:52.479 Jenny Duan: yeah, yeah. 375 00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.050 huda: Do you know, Maddie, I think I think she's a dropout, but. 376 00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:58.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I know. Maddie. 377 00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:58.950 huda: Yeah, yeah. 378 00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:03.870 Jenny Duan: Oh, that was her essay. Oh, okay, her essay is cool, too. 379 00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:05.240 huda: Yeah. 380 00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:09.049 Jenny Duan: So let's see you. You like role playing games right? 381 00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:10.050 huda: Yeah. 382 00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:15.970 Jenny Duan: So tell me more about like how role playing games are usually introduced to a person. 383 00:56:17.703 --> 00:56:19.110 huda: Usually like 384 00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:20.670 huda: it like. 385 00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:31.009 huda: I don't know like there's no like one format that it's like written, but it's usually like they like like kind of show you like the setting, and then it describes like the 386 00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:38.430 huda: kind of like the main character, and then and then you as like a player has to like, have to like, go and like talk to different like 387 00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:41.141 huda: like non player characters, to like 388 00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:45.180 huda: to like, learn about their story and stuff. 389 00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:48.839 huda: Actually, like, one interesting thing that we could take from this 390 00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.160 huda: is like. 391 00:56:50.892 --> 00:57:11.047 huda: is like, maybe this might be a little corny. But like in like video games like there's usually like the protagonist that you play as and then, like you kind of like, learn about like, like the other characters are kind of irrelevant, and you kind of learn about them like kind of slightly to like dialogue and everything. But like maybe we could write it. I could write an essay about like how 392 00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:19.379 huda: like I always felt like I was like the main character of like the of like a story like an Rpg, and then I like 393 00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:34.660 huda: I felt like everyone else, was kind of that way. But then kind of like starting an organization helped me realize that there's like different perspectives to a game, and that like, maybe they're the main characters, and they're like Rpg, and then then, maybe, like, I'm like 394 00:57:34.904 --> 00:57:39.619 huda: an Npc, and then they have to help me do a quest, or I don't know. I feel like that would be 395 00:57:40.088 --> 00:57:45.170 huda: that could be like an interesting take in terms of like video game development, like things that 396 00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:51.169 huda: I like like an event that calls me to learn something. I think that could be an interesting take. 397 00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.469 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for sure. 398 00:57:55.250 --> 00:58:00.019 Jenny Duan: how would you like put the put the reader into your story like, how would you frame that. 399 00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:08.770 Jenny Duan: Like. How, what would be the scene that you'd open up with to get the reader involved. 400 00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:15.062 huda: I think also, a lot of games start off with like you get to like design your character. 401 00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.220 huda: so like, maybe 402 00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:20.210 huda: maybe I could like 403 00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:26.358 huda: kind of like, do something similar, so I could be like in the character selector. I choose 404 00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:34.735 huda: like long black hair with brown eyes and like this skin tone, and then 405 00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.180 huda: Then I loaded into the game, and I. 406 00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:48.950 Jenny Duan: You could. You could also like maybe that could be an opportunity to talk about the hair a little bit, and how like your hair is different from your sisters, or you know, whatever your hair is, the same as your sisters with different moms or something like that. Yeah. 407 00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:50.330 huda: That'll be interesting. Yeah. 408 00:58:52.220 --> 00:59:01.060 huda: hmm. And then, like, maybe like, extremely like a specific like quest stuff to go on like, for example. But it has like relate to my life, like, for example. 409 00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:04.430 huda: like. 410 00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:14.909 huda: or actually like. Wouldn't it make better sense if it's like the fact that, like going on a quest like gives like an Npc kind of like an importance like 411 00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:17.654 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 412 00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:24.002 huda: And Pari. I was kind of like a quest, because I'm like helping like an Npc. 413 00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:25.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah. 414 00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:35.220 huda: But like, yeah, like, I think there's 2 ways that I can go. I don't. I'm not really sure like which way, which sounds better. 415 00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:51.616 huda: and I could be like, and maybe if I really wanted to time like the detail about like 416 00:59:52.270 --> 01:00:00.220 huda: like, which music I really like, I could be like the 8 bit version of like this song was playing as a soundtrack of my life 417 01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.009 huda: something I don't like that. 418 01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.835 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let's do that. 419 01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:07.990 Jenny Duan: Okay. 420 01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:10.619 Jenny Duan: I think this is a good 421 01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:12.940 Jenny Duan: start. 422 01:00:17.738 --> 01:00:23.899 Jenny Duan: So what would be like the line of what would be like your hero or characters, are throughout this essay. 423 01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:28.560 huda: So I think like starting off 424 01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.040 huda: kind of like 425 01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:39.282 huda: as like the main character going on quests and like kind of just doing stuff like, you know, in games, how usually like like characters do 426 01:00:39.810 --> 01:01:05.630 huda: they do like, I think, actually something that I just came up with, like, how like in video games, like people just do like quest to get like experience, like in the game and everything, and maybe level up and then it's like, not really important. Maybe, like I could start off like the I could start off the essay like, kind of like doing that like, oh, I'm just gonna off to do like another experience mission and like help out this Npc, and then, like, maybe I could like. 427 01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:23.460 huda: maybe there could be like one specific incidence, like, for example, with like starting in pairing AI, where I noticed that like that like, it's just. It's not just like me gaining like experience in the game, or it's it's helping like the Npc's storyline as well. But like 428 01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.960 huda: I feel like this is all like good. But I don't know how I'd be able to write it like 429 01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.010 huda: that. 430 01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.510 huda: Oh, without sounding like really 431 01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:36.219 huda: like a technical like, I feel like it would sound really technical. 432 01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.140 huda: But. 433 01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.470 Jenny Duan: Hmm, okay. So 434 01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:47.010 Jenny Duan: so you're gonna play, you're gonna plant your character in this. 435 01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.990 Jenny Duan: Do they have an end goal 436 01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:55.179 Jenny Duan: like, it's empowering. Yeah, what is like the end goal. I still don't quite understand. Here. 437 01:01:55.890 --> 01:02:04.919 huda: Oh, the end goal was like, it's kind of like realizing that, like the people that are like, let's see, like the people that are part of empowering AI like, maybe like 438 01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:10.990 huda: they're gonna be like the players that I that they're gonna be like the characters that aren't really like played by the player, which is me 439 01:02:11.466 --> 01:02:21.269 huda: and so like, maybe like, I realized that like like helping like doing the empowering AI like quest has like helped 440 01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:33.620 huda: has like not just like given me, like experience, which kind of has a double meaning. Like the game experience as well as like an actual experience. But it's also like, helped 441 01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.870 huda: like the people. And like. 442 01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.960 huda: maybe. 443 01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:37.910 huda: like. 444 01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.140 huda: like, maybe like, I can like, come to like a realization that like 445 01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.390 huda: it's just like, don't just like, do these things, for. 446 01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:53.190 huda: like the heck of it, like, kind of just you're doing it. Cause you're like actually helping like the Npcs and everything. 447 01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.360 Jenny Duan: That's really cool. 448 01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:19.060 Jenny Duan: I feel like, though you shouldn't maybe center your game, your story, or your essay about empowering AI, though like, is there a way we can make it a separate game that encompasses things out outside empowering. AI, too, because I feel like that should be like, what element of your game. But I don't want to write your whole essay about empowering AI, because we might want to write about that in like a more specific like, oh, what do you like? 449 01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:22.810 Jenny Duan: More specifically tech essay or some other theme? 450 01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.450 huda: Be like 451 01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.879 huda: So like I think I discussed about like how my favorite game was like 452 01:04:02.313 --> 01:04:20.000 huda: mutazone and they talk about like, it's like one aspect of it. And like many other different types of games like that. They're often like, your like actions have consequences. And so I think that's like one angle we might be able to take from it 453 01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:29.440 huda: and so like, since we're not doing like empowering, AI is the main focus. Maybe it's just I could talk a little bit about something more personal. 454 01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.700 huda: like, for example, like 455 01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:39.819 huda: maybe like reading like classical literature 456 01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:50.249 huda: has like led me to enjoy writing a little bit better, and maybe have, like my increase my vocabulary, maybe, and maybe like 457 01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:12.259 huda: like in the game like, if we interact with like different people like in that game that I really enjoy like, there's like different like consequences. And like building like your story like, I don't know how it's like specific to me, though, like, that's like the problem. I don't know how to make it. 458 01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:15.120 Jenny Duan: You can insert these 21 facts in. 459 01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.748 huda: Yeah, yeah, I think so, too. 460 01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.070 huda: yeah. So maybe like these, like these, like things 461 01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:28.540 huda: happened for a reason. Or maybe I could talk about like. 462 01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:34.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. And they could all be like, like all these could be like challenges that your character has to overcome. For example, like 463 01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.880 Jenny Duan: you could be like oh, like you. 464 01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:41.800 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like dealt with this 465 01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:48.380 Jenny Duan: these like Msa. Boys, but now you're like part of the mia like you your character like lost, like 466 01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:54.389 Jenny Duan: 2 health points, or something, but like gain, like 50 experience like it could be like a game type of situation where they like. 467 01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:05.040 Jenny Duan: you know, have obstacles along the way, but, like you're still reaching that end, like I don't think there necessarily has to be an end. But, like, your character is like working towards the quest. And like. 468 01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:06.070 Jenny Duan: yeah. 469 01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:09.160 huda: Yeah, that sounds great. 470 01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.059 huda: so I'm like writing this 471 01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.705 huda: like, is there one that I should like, really, like, specifically, like, focus on or 472 01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:20.910 huda: kind of like listing. All of these would be like 473 01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.730 huda: most effective. 474 01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:29.239 Jenny Duan: Let's pick like 3 like experiences that your character faces. 475 01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:33.479 huda: I'm thinking that like maybe even like 476 01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:42.080 huda: I'm not sure if you've ever played like the Nintendo like pokemon games, but like there's like different, like attacks and stuff 477 01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.779 huda: and like, it's like you're kind of like battling one person 478 01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:50.019 huda: and then, like you said, like losing HP, and then like gaining experience. Stuff! 479 01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.307 huda: like that. It could. I could like narrate it that way. 480 01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.600 huda: Think. 481 01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 482 01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:59.810 Jenny Duan: so what? Okay, what are like, maybe 3 things 483 01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:03.690 Jenny Duan: people, you and your game are experiencing or fighting. 484 01:07:05.258 --> 01:07:14.199 Jenny Duan: The Msa thing could be one. These could also be positive, you know, like they could be like instances. Where are the experiences that have helped you grow as a person. 485 01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:44.399 huda: maybe like when I was younger, like having my sis, and I feel like this might be like overdone. But like having my sister like really like help me with everything and kind of giving me advice like resulted in me giving my brother advice, and like kind of like a chain effect. 486 01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:52.409 Jenny Duan: Okay. I feel like your sister can be a character who supports you on a quest. But I don't think she should be like 487 01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.969 Jenny Duan: our own quest. 488 01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:56.950 Jenny Duan: And that makes sense. Okay. 489 01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:03.349 huda: Yeah, what if? Like, okay, would it make sense? If, like, she was like a character who's like helping me? 490 01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:07.580 huda: like on a quest like, educate 491 01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:10.160 huda: like, or like help my brother at something like 492 01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:16.550 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's not. That's like about other people like your brother and your sister can be characters, but like 493 01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.490 Jenny Duan: you should be your own maker. 494 01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.240 huda: Okay. 495 01:08:21.028 --> 01:08:23.180 huda: so maybe not that example like 496 01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:40.109 huda: Maybe like I could do like kind of meeting like Mary Shelley in the game, who like she's like one of like the authors that I really like 497 01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:46.208 huda: and then, like, I can like describe her and like doing like a quest with her, and then. 498 01:08:46.510 --> 01:09:13.030 Jenny Duan: That's that's still too much about other people. This has to be. You like Mary Shelley, like she's interesting. That's not you, though you can say, like the character has a Mary Shelley book in her backpack because she likes Mary Shelley. Character has, like Frankenstein or something. But like let's do like I think it has to be. You have to be like, extremely selfish in this essay, like you only have 600 words. You cannot be writing a long description about Mary Shelley has to be about you. 499 01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:26.739 huda: actually like, I don't know if that had like, too big of an impact on me, either. So. 500 01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.839 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, yeah. Then even less of an excuse to put her in. 501 01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:32.174 huda: Yeah, 502 01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:40.379 huda: I feel like, okay, so I kind of 503 01:09:42.219 --> 01:09:51.749 huda: I'm not sure like how to add, like a positive experience to like like, you know how we did like the Msa. Like kind of like fight scene, I guess. Like in the story 504 01:09:51.819 --> 01:10:01.119 huda: I'm like, how would I that. How would I be able to use like a positive effect like cause? If I'm trying to like like, for example, I'm trying to do like 505 01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:09.009 huda: oh, I was able to interact with like this person. And I was able to get this straight. But then again, like, that's like too much about another person. 506 01:10:11.409 --> 01:10:24.739 huda: maybe like like, would it be possible, like as my character like like the thing that I was talking about like my heirloom for my great grandma like maybe like I could be like my characters like wearing that those like earrings, and like. 507 01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.495 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 508 01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.080 huda: And like. 509 01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:43.500 huda: if this might be like too much, but like if I like, whenever like, I think about it, or if I like, I like touch it or something. Then then I think about like my great grandma, and like think about like oh, she would help me in this situation, but, like you said, I think, is that like not. 510 01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.190 huda: I feel like, would that be like to like away from me in the essay or. 511 01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.751 Jenny Duan: I think that's fine. 512 01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.179 Jenny Duan: I think that's not like a thing that yours your character experiences, though yet 513 01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:15.479 Jenny Duan: like they should be like concrete experiences like, for example, this Msa thing is big. Maybe J. Camp is big. What else is like big in your life, like perhaps like starting Full cliff like things like that, like the hackathon like. That's what I mean. Instead of like details, we want experiences. 514 01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:18.390 huda: Hmm! 515 01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.350 huda: Hmm! Hmm. 516 01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.380 Jenny Duan: That's why we talked about like what experiences make you you? 517 01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.670 Jenny Duan: That's what we want to insert here. 518 01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:47.418 huda: this is kind of tough. 519 01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.760 huda: maybe, like. 520 01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.180 huda: go 521 01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.710 huda: getting to 522 01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.360 huda: like. 523 01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:10.739 huda: maybe like founding founding folklift has helped me like. 524 01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:15.599 huda: be more like empathetic and like like kind of 525 01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:27.130 huda: change, my perspective on like how I see like different problems, like, for example, I'm starting to like, think of a lot more like like systemic issues about like 526 01:12:27.906 --> 01:12:29.260 huda: about like 527 01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.740 huda: women and like myself, and like South Asian identities 528 01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.499 huda: that could be like one. 529 01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.769 Jenny Duan: Do you have a founding story for folklift like? Why, folklift. 530 01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:47.719 huda: Yeah, I think, definitely like in my community, like, since we didn't really have like stores and stuff. 531 01:12:48.555 --> 01:12:49.360 huda: So 532 01:12:49.370 --> 01:13:01.200 huda: like, maybe talking about like how like my small community of like Muslims, like they they often like, didn't have like the publicity, and like different like resources, is like the other 533 01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:09.089 huda: resources, such as like, you know, getting lots of like representation on like Facebook and everything despite like. 534 01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:17.800 huda: maybe like doing better or like having like cheaper prices like they just like weren't like featured many times on like Facebook groups and like 535 01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:27.560 huda: things like that. And then I'm building like folklift for them to like, you know, be able to talk about their stories, founding like their small businesses, and like not just like 536 01:13:28.355 --> 01:13:33.230 huda: and you know, like, just like about their process and starting it. 537 01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:39.660 huda: But yeah, I don't know if that's that's really like, I don't know if I can narrate that like. Interestingly enough. 538 01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.080 Jenny Duan: Okay. 539 01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:57.319 Jenny Duan: But if you can't think of experiences that have shaped you, I'm just gonna give you experiences that I think you could write about, and then you could just write about them, and we could go from there. 540 01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.769 Jenny Duan: Would that be better. 541 01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:00.022 huda: Yeah, I think so. 542 01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:08.218 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, let's talk about the Msa thing that's like one challenge that you overcame. Let's talk about 543 01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.950 Jenny Duan: The process of hosting the hackathon. 544 01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:14.730 Jenny Duan: That seems really important to you. 545 01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.839 Jenny Duan: And then let's do like let's focus on like 546 01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:23.959 Jenny Duan: maybe one important interview that you did that changed like your perspective storytelling and journalism. 547 01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:27.310 Jenny Duan: How does that sound. 548 01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.540 huda: Yeah. 549 01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:50.830 huda: yeah, I think that sounds great. In terms of like the hackathon thing like. So the last thing it was kind of like a negative thing which was like oh, like these, like Ms. People won't like accept me, and, like I, I like, fought it, or whatever, and like I found, like I got experience like the Nyna. How would that work for like, I guess the other 2. And like maybe 550 01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:53.110 huda: specifically like the 551 01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:59.989 huda: founding like they're like the hackathon like, how would I be able to like kind of put it in like gaming format 552 01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.410 huda: that way? 553 01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.650 Jenny Duan: m 554 01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:24.620 Jenny Duan: Your character has to like. 555 01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.550 Jenny Duan: There's like a I don't know what's common trope games 556 01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:35.170 Jenny Duan: like meeting up with other super heroes, or like other characters, or like 557 01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:37.610 Jenny Duan: like some type of teamwork related thing 558 01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:40.380 Jenny Duan: I think about like they have to build a hackathon 559 01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:45.845 Jenny Duan: like something like that. And then for the interview. That's just like your character encountered someone. 560 01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:48.929 huda: Okay, that sounds good. 561 01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:52.320 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 562 01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So I think 563 01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.770 Jenny Duan: we have a meeting tomorrow. I'm wondering, is this too short of a timeline to make progress on your essay. 564 01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:02.880 Jenny Duan: or do you wanna meet tomorrow. 565 01:16:03.607 --> 01:16:08.610 huda: I feel like I could use a little more time to like work on it. Maybe. 566 01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:16.910 Jenny Duan: Honestly, I was thinking about meeting Sunday night instead. Would that work for you, or do you already have a meeting on Sunday night? I need to double check. 567 01:16:18.513 --> 01:16:23.706 Jenny Duan: Yeah, would you wanna meet Sunday, or would you wanna meet like later on?

How's it going. 2 00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.310 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:47.400 Jenny Duan: Doing? Well, it's good to see you again. And yeah, what's I mean? I know we just met yesterday. So I mean, is there any? Are there any updates from yesterday? If not, we can kind of just like jump into things, but would love to hear if there's anything new. 4 00:11:48.356 --> 00:12:02.200 huda: I'm basically done with my application to the Muslim youth North, or North America. I think it was called that one like I'm almost done. I had to answer like one more essay, I think. But 5 00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:07.492 huda: yeah, I don't think I don't think it's like that serious. But I was able to like update like my 6 00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:14.199 huda: I was able to like upload like a few like pictures and videos that I've done so that like, maybe they know a little bit about like 7 00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.410 huda: what my skills are. But yeah. 8 00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.810 Jenny Duan: You wanna share? What's the easiest way for us to look at that 9 00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.608 Jenny Duan: like? Would that be 10 00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.269 Jenny Duan: And do you wanna share your screen to share that link with me. What's the best. 11 00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.551 huda: I can share my screen. 12 00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:41.530 huda: so I think I just had to add some like information. And then here I talked about like 13 00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:59.630 huda: my experience with like the media arts and then student use. And then Filmmakers club. And then I talked about like getting recognized regionally for one of our short films. And then I also talked about like in my free time, I like to do like photography and phone cinematic videos. 14 00:12:59.975 --> 00:13:09.139 huda: And I talked about I talke",
    "d about like my social media like on my other account. I call like 2 50 K views. But I think that's like. 15 00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:29.179 huda: yeah, I just use as a metric. But and then here, I didn't fill this out yet. But I was gonna talk about like how I wanna I wanna make like this organization more like accessible to more people. Cause I I feel like I didn't hear about it until, like you kind of told me so. If like, we build our social media presence more and as well as like 16 00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:38.070 huda: kind of doing a lot more publicity for like the different camps and everything, and making appealing for people that's like what I would like to do. And then 17 00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:57.145 huda: here, maybe, like I can talk about like I could like, maybe even like talk into specifics about like how like visualization is gonna be like important for like people or like art is gonna be like important for like people to like know what they're getting into if they're sending up for camps and everything and 18 00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:20.210 huda: And so like the best way to like kind of visualize them through art is kind of like creating stuff that is true to like our beliefs and everything but we still have to like appeal to more people to join and make it like a safe space, and then like art, and like photography and stuff, and that that could be like a good tool for that. That's that's what I want to say here. 19 00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.459 huda: And then this last one I want to talk about like 20 00:14:23.911 --> 00:14:41.749 huda: how like photography and videography has been like my platform of storytelling like, I've also game developer. So I like storytelling in general. But I'm like photography and videography has been like kind of like a platform for me to use that, I think.

I just need like a little more time to like finish, like the answer answer with questions and everything.

I don't think I have any updates since the last time. 57 00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:59.937 Jenny Duan: Okay, I I was thinking today we could spend some time talking through like the common app prompts. And like, now that we're approaching August. I think it's about time to like start writing your common app in your early application. So yeah, have you? We've looked at the common app prompts, and I know that you've written this for English. 58 00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.280 Jenny Duan: Do you feel like particularly drawn towards any of the prompts that you wanted 59 00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.250 Jenny Duan: 2. 60 00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.140 huda: Aye. 61 00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.580 huda: I think I'll have to take a look again. I don't remember",
    ". I think I 62 00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.680 huda: yeah, I don't remember. I feel like I chose one, and then I I forgot. But 63 00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:28.115 huda: I think probably obstacles like I think I wanna talk about like 64 00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.759 huda: like an obstacle that I faced. 65 00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.719 huda: But then again, like I don't know. 66 00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:44.638 huda: like I feel like other people that are choosing that the like kind of obstacle like prompt might have, like, not bigger, like problems. But like, I feel like more 67 00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.040 huda: I guess 68 00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:53.800 huda: larger problems than the kind that I would write about like being like discreet as like a woman in stem and everything. I think that would be like a little 69 00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.085 huda: right about. So maybe not. The obstacles prompt. 70 00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.191 huda: these are. It's kinda hard to choose. But 71 00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.130 huda: maybe a topic idea or concept 72 00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.730 huda: I find engaging and makes me lose track of 73 00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.860 huda: time. 74 00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.310 huda: I feel like that could be interesting. 75 00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.520 huda: Yeah, do you. 76 00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.470 Jenny Duan: Wanna talk like? What are you thinking? Gaming like? 77 00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.460 Jenny Duan: What Field do you think is. 78 00:19:32.794 --> 00:19:39.145 huda: There's like different, like, different, like ways. I can write about it like, I could either write about like, 79 00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.700 huda: like. 80 00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:52.180 huda: okay, so this is kind of like general right? Because, like, since we're since, I'm like applying to like different colleges with like different majors. This kind of carts are right by like one thing, but like 81 00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.129 huda: either, like the lack of like repr",
    "esent media representation. 82 00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:12.620 huda: For like for like and like, why that matters like just not just because you want to see someone on the screen, but because of like learning, diverse perspectives like, that's something that's I'm like, really passionate about. And I definitely like, think about that a lot. 83 00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.510 huda: And then other that, or maybe 84 00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.520 huda: like. 85 00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.560 huda: yeah, I could do something about gaming. And I could like 86 00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.879 huda: right about like how like the gaming culture like how it's 87 00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.780 huda: like maybe, like 88 00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.019 huda: pretty detrimental or not detrimental. But 89 00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:47.419 huda: oh, I could also like, I think, one diverse like perspective that I have is like as like a Muslim and like, I'm like, I play a lot of games that are like like valorant and fortnite and stuff, and sometimes, like I have to feel like a little bit. 90 00:20:48.195 --> 00:21:01.720 huda: I have to feel like a little bit kind of skeptical, or like cautious when I'm playing those things and like and like, or maybe if I wanted to select stream or be like A Youtuber or something, I must think about that a little bit, cause it feels like if you're a Muslim 91 00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:13.150 huda: representing like Muslims, I feel like. And then also, it's like there's a very violent stereotype for Muslims. And that's like something I've thought about, because. 92 00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:24.479 huda: yeah, like my parents like stopped me from playing like Ga violent games because they thought it was like too violent or anything but a lot of people haven't like had that experience. 93 00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.430 huda: And so like. 94 00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.390 Jenny Duan: Like up. 95 00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.343 huda: Just like. 96 00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.560 h",
    "uda: why is it violent for some people not violent for some people, I think 97 00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.859 huda: that might be 98 00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.300 huda: like a good thing to write about. 99 00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.680 huda: Yeah. 100 00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.340 Jenny Duan: Hunt. 101 00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.980 huda: Yeah. 102 00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.730 Jenny Duan: Go ahead! 103 00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.449 huda: No, yeah, that was like all the ideas I had. 104 00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:47.070 Jenny Duan: Out of the ones that you've written so far, which one of the essays has been like the favorite. 105 00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.129 huda: Let me let me check with the common app like assignment that I had. 106 00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.430 huda: I wrote. Okay. So I wrote. 107 00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:21.223 huda: I think the one that I over J. Camp like about like which topic I'd really want to report on. And then I talked about like like the divide between like different, like like races and ethnicities within Islam, and that one was like one of my favorite essays that I've written 108 00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.710 huda: And there's also one. 109 00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:37.333 huda: I think, the other time. I don't really like the way I wrote it, for, like my assignment, but it was kind of like, still interesting, the the prompt which says to like, Reflect on a time where you challenged like a belief or idea, 110 00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:38.549 Jenny Duan: Talk about. 111 00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:46.029 huda: Like challenging, like, kind of how you're supposed to play Minecraft.

It's like, really like interesting. It's like a basically like one of the shows that you kinda like would watch. But then it's like interactive and 182 00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:32.289 huda: like, I feel like it's also kind of like a modern twist on it like sci-fi, but then mixed with like kind of like us, like a 183 00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.750 huda: like a normal like soap opera that you'd like watch. But it's like. 184 00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.150 Jenny Duan: But like, what's the interactive part. 185 00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:46.469 huda: It's like you get to make like the decisions of, like what the girl does and like, how she interacts with, like the different 186 00:32:47.097 --> 00:32:50.579 huda: would like the different town town people. 187 00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.319 huda: and then, like that kind of like dictates, like the relationship at the end. So it's like. 188 00:32:55.870 --> 00:33:04.210 huda: like, do you end up like ruling the or not ruling, but like taking care of, like the island after, like the grandpa grandfather, like Pat. 189 00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.360 Jenny Duan: So that's kind of like 190 00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.549 Jenny Duan: that's kind of like animal c",
    "rossing. 191 00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:15.089 huda: Kinda yeah, like, it's a little more like there's like a lot more story to it, though. 192 00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:23.269 Jenny Duan: Nice. That sounds really. So, yeah, put that down. That seems like like something really interesting that you could write about. 193 00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.505 huda: Yeah, 194 00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.230 huda: okay, what else?

But I think I have like 16, 196 00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:32.429 huda: and then 197 00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:37.319 huda: and like, Wait, can you like, say, those ideas that you kind of gave 198 00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.443 huda: a couple minutes ago? 199 00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:43.780 huda: like, for example, that you said like favorite game. And they said 200 00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.860 huda: a like. 201 00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:53.020 Jenny Duan: So let's make it more.

    "5:47.420 huda: I like, I guess, like to be more specific. I like writing about 213 00:35:48.710 --> 00:36:01.519 huda: about like things that people haven't thought before, like like something that happens pretty commonly, and then like getting able to write something like that. I've noticed that people don't really talk about. 214 00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.230 huda: I like writing about that 215 00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.200 huda: I'm with you. 216 00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:21.860 Jenny Duan: Wait!

But like, are they like, usually. 218 00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.200 huda: what do I think? Mango. 219 00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:53.509 huda: I think, like, actually, like, like a really like big like Per. One of my personality. Traits, I think, should be like, separate from even like. The fashion thing is that I'm like really nostalgic 220 00:37:53.882 --> 00:38:05.809 huda: which I don't know. It's really a good because, like, I think colleges might want it to be like something in the future or something. But like, I feel like I'm always like thinking about like 221 00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:10.299 huda: I could like talk about like the past 4 h like especially 222 00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:26.859 huda: so like a specific thing is like, I got like like these earrings that belong to like my great grandmother. And it's just like I could like literally talk about like hours about like how she's probably worn these like since, like during like the British rule. 223 00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.819 Jenny Duan: Write write that down, then write that specific thing down. 224 00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.880 huda: But yeah. 225 00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:40.861 huda: and like, also about like how she how like things that she's done. 226 00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:53.259 huda: that she did wearing those earrings",
    ". So continue on today, like I still wear those earrings and eyes continue to do like parts for a culture. I think that's like really fascinating to me. 227 00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.590 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Why? Okay? 228 00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.690 Jenny Duan: So 229 00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.689 Jenny Duan: okay, that makes sense. 230 00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.260 Jenny Duan: this is so much better. 231 00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.930 Jenny Duan: So good.

I think it's it's like a hard to choose between 235 00:40:50.676 --> 00:40:52.886 huda: beba doobie and 236 00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:02.480 huda: I think I can do my top 3 not in order, but I can't see like my favorite artist. So either, like Frank Sinatra 237 00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.090 Jenny Duan: Moon. 238 00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:10.759 huda: Ruby or Billy Joel. I think any of those 3, and it's kind of like strange, because they're all from like really different time periods. 239 00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.619 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, write that down. 240 00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.230 Jenny Duan: Paul. 241 00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.630 Jenny Duan: Parallel. 242 00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.229 Jenny Duan: Okay.

I don't know what else to say. 245 00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:13.839 huda: Is it like 246 00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.989 huda: I like cats? Does that?

    "They don't like cats or dogs like just they. They don't let us have like those type of animals.

But I think I think it's because, like, I feel like like all South Asian parents have, like kind of trauma from them, cause like at least for my mom, like there's like a dog that like chased her, and like almost bit her, because, like in like in South Asia. It's really 257 00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.090 huda: but like 258 00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.329 huda: stray dogs to be like evil.

So now we need to think about like, what is the story you want to tell about yourself, like these are all things that make you you. What is something? What is like one situation or one example? We can come up with, that ties all these pieces together. So your combative essay should kind of allude to like the types of problems you want to solve in the future, and like your core values that make up who you are. 290 00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760 Jenny Duan: So 291 00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:51.069 Jenny Duan: if we were to try to distill all of this like in your thinking like, what makes you you. 292 00:48:54.395 --> 00:48:56.740 huda: Like which one of these points, or 293 00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.270 huda: home. 294 00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.859 Jenny Duan: No, no, just lik",

    "e worse times. But then, like as like someone kind of like thinking back like as someone who's like kind of nostalgic. I like thinking back on like kind of like the times where things were like 315 00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:43.929 huda: we're like kind of like in better conditions. And then maybe like taking steps to like kind of 316 00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.849 huda: going back in time and like like kind of doing things that 317 00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:54.200 huda: doing things that like I may have done in the past, or like people may have done the past. 318 00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.300 huda: Yeah. 319 00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.540 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So 320 00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:03.679 Jenny Duan: how can we weave that into story format? 321 00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.419 Jenny Duan: Is there a common theme within the nostalgia that you experience. 322 00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.839 Jenny Duan: Very thinking about a certain like type of memory, or 323 00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:18.690 Jenny Duan: I think I. 324 00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.440 huda: I think a lot of the time. 325 00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:24.480 huda: Maybe, like 326 00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:36.149 huda: I think, like historically, like as well, like, maybe not stuff that I have like that nostalgic for, but like kind of like thinking on the past about like, like, I'm really curious about like my ancestors 327 00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:43.380 huda: like, I'm almost thinking like, if my answers here like what would be they'd be thinking, or like and kind of like 328 00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:58.570 huda: like. For example, I think I kind of mentioned like about like my hair type. Like it's kind of like comes along with grandma, and so like I don't thinking like oh, like she looked like me when she's younger. But then again, I think I don't know if that's like the 329 00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.610 huda: really telling about me.

And then I'm learning from that is like. 343 00:52:55.930 --> 00:53:05.210 huda: kind of if you don't get what you want from like from like external like sources like, it's always better to create, like your own opportunities and like. 344 00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.849 huda: maybe even create opportunities for other people. 345 00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:15.280 huda: And that's something that I learned from that. And that kind of changed. How I thought of things cause I was like really fixated on, like, you know, getting like 346 00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:24.790 huda: leadership positions from someone else, or like, you know, that kind of like external validation. Maybe that like event really like, change me 347 00:53:31.185 --> 00:53:32.050 Jenny Duan: Cool. 348 00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.820 Jenny Duan: Let's think 349 00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:40.660 Jenny Duan: what else? 350 00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:45.430 Jenny Duan: I feel like we need to find someth",
    "ing like pretty unique. 351 00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.420 Jenny Duan: maybe. What if you wrote like your life as a video game. 352 00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:50.810 huda: Never in the. 353 00:53:50.810 --> 00:54:00.090 Jenny Duan: Like, put your life into like the framework of a video game. So we make it sound like you're like playing a game. But like, you're like the main character in your own show. 354 00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:03.180 Jenny Duan: like what video games have taught you about life. You know. 355 00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.750 huda: Yeah, that sounds pretty interesting. 356 00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:15.210 Jenny Duan: I wonder like, how I feel like that's like a really good way to start off the essay. But, like, let me try to think about how you would like. Put the character in your world. 357 00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:25.889 huda: My my dad is showing me like an essay before where? It's I think it's like it was like in the format of like a Minecraft chat. 358 00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:37.689 huda: So like, it was like her, like experience, like online, like skepticism, and like kind of discrimination on Minecraft. And like, it was really cool, because it was like in the format of like Minecraft. 359 00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:43.619 huda: like text. So that was that was like something interesting from like the format that I could take away. 360 00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.479 huda: That's something similar like in a 361 00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.700 huda: game kind of way. But. 362 00:54:54.221 --> 00:54:58.150 Jenny Duan: How did that? Can you send me that essay? How did that essay describe it? 363 00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:00.760 huda: I don't have it right now. I'll 364 00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.080 huda: I could send it to you after this, maybe. But like 365 00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.190 huda: basically, they said, like, they basically like 366 00:55:07.906 --> 00:55:11.449 huda: like, let me put in the chat like, for example, like how they did like you said like. 367 00:",
    "55:16.530 --> 00:55:21.770 huda: and they actually like it was kind of like interesting, because the person actually said like a couple like 368 00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:29.420 huda: swear words and like slurs and stuff. And they're in the thing and their essay, which was confusing to me, but like 369 00:55:30.506 --> 00:55:38.100 huda: like, for example, like this is like how one of the things looked, and that's like how the the format of like Minecraft messages. 370 00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.380 Jenny Duan: Hello! 371 00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.600 Jenny Duan: What! What school did this person end up going to. 372 00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:44.630 huda: Stanford actually. 373 00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.890 Jenny Duan: Cool. So what if you did something like that? But like, obviously for different. But like. 374 00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:52.479 Jenny Duan: yeah, yeah. 375 00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.050 huda: Do you know, Maddie, I think I think she's a dropout, but. 376 00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:58.170 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I know. Maddie. 377 00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:58.950 huda: Yeah, yeah. 378 00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:03.870 Jenny Duan: Oh, that was her essay. Oh, okay, her essay is cool, too. 379 00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:05.240 huda: Yeah. 380 00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:09.049 Jenny Duan: So let's see you. You like role playing games right? 381 00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:10.050 huda: Yeah. 382 00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:15.970 Jenny Duan: So tell me more about like how role playing games are usually introduced to a person. 383 00:56:17.703 --> 00:56:19.110 huda: Usually like 384 00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:20.670 huda: it like. 385 00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:31.009 huda: I don't know like there's no like one format that it's like written, but it's usually like they like like kind of show you like the setting, and then it describes like the 386 00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:38.430 huda: kind of like the main character, and then and then you as like a player has to like, have to like, go and like talk to different ",
    "like 387 00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:41.141 huda: like non player characters, to like 388 00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:45.180 huda: to like, learn about their story and stuff. 389 00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:48.839 huda: Actually, like, one interesting thing that we could take from this 390 00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.160 huda: is like. 391 00:56:50.892 --> 00:57:11.047 huda: is like, maybe this might be a little corny. But like in like video games like there's usually like the protagonist that you play as and then, like you kind of like, learn about like, like the other characters are kind of irrelevant, and you kind of learn about them like kind of slightly to like dialogue and everything. But like maybe we could write it. I could write an essay about like how 392 00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:19.379 huda: like I always felt like I was like the main character of like the of like a story like an Rpg, and then I like 393 00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:34.660 huda: I felt like everyone else, was kind of that way. But then kind of like starting an organization helped me realize that there's like different perspectives to a game, and that like, maybe they're the main characters, and they're like Rpg, and then then, maybe, like, I'm like 394 00:57:34.904 --> 00:57:39.619 huda: an Npc, and then they have to help me do a quest, or I don't know. I feel like that would be 395 00:57:40.088 --> 00:57:45.170 huda: that could be like an interesting take in terms of like video game development, like things that 396 00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:51.169 huda: I like like an event that calls me to learn something. I think that could be an interesting take. 397 00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.469 Jenny Duan: Yeah, for sure. 398 00:57:55.250 --> 00:58:00.019 Jenny Duan: how would you like put the put the reader into your story like, how would you frame that. 399 00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:08.770 Jenny Duan: Like. How, what would be the scene that you'd open up with to get the reader involved. 400 00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:15.062 huda: ",
    "I think also, a lot of games start off with like you get to like design your character. 401 00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.220 huda: so like, maybe 402 00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:20.210 huda: maybe I could like 403 00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:26.358 huda: kind of like, do something similar, so I could be like in the character selector. I choose 404 00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:34.735 huda: like long black hair with brown eyes and like this skin tone, and then 405 00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.180 huda: Then I loaded into the game, and I. 406 00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:48.950 Jenny Duan: You could. You could also like maybe that could be an opportunity to talk about the hair a little bit, and how like your hair is different from your sisters, or you know, whatever your hair is, the same as your sisters with different moms or something like that. Yeah. 407 00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:50.330 huda: That'll be interesting. Yeah. 408 00:58:52.220 --> 00:59:01.060 huda: hmm. And then, like, maybe like, extremely like a specific like quest stuff to go on like, for example. But it has like relate to my life, like, for example. 409 00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:04.430 huda: like. 410 00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:14.909 huda: or actually like. Wouldn't it make better sense if it's like the fact that, like going on a quest like gives like an Npc kind of like an importance like 411 00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:17.654 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 412 00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:24.002 huda: And Pari. I was kind of like a quest, because I'm like helping like an Npc. 413 00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:25.530 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah. 414 00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:35.220 huda: But like, yeah, like, I think there's 2 ways that I can go. I don't. I'm not really sure like which way, which sounds better. 415 00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:51.616 huda: and I could be like, and maybe if I really wanted to time like the detail about like 416 00:59:52.270 --> 01:00:00.220 huda: like, which music I really like, I could be like the 8 bit version of like this song was playing as a",
    " soundtrack of my life 417 01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.009 huda: something I don't like that. 418 01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.835 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let's do that. 419 01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:07.990 Jenny Duan: Okay. 420 01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:10.619 Jenny Duan: I think this is a good 421 01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:12.940 Jenny Duan: start. 422 01:00:17.738 --> 01:00:23.899 Jenny Duan: So what would be like the line of what would be like your hero or characters, are throughout this essay. 423 01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:28.560 huda: So I think like starting off 424 01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.040 huda: kind of like 425 01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:39.282 huda: as like the main character going on quests and like kind of just doing stuff like, you know, in games, how usually like like characters do 426 01:00:39.810 --> 01:01:05.630 huda: they do like, I think, actually something that I just came up with, like, how like in video games, like people just do like quest to get like experience, like in the game and everything, and maybe level up and then it's like, not really important. Maybe, like I could start off like the I could start off the essay like, kind of like doing that like, oh, I'm just gonna off to do like another experience mission and like help out this Npc, and then, like, maybe I could like. 427 01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:23.460 huda: maybe there could be like one specific incidence, like, for example, with like starting in pairing AI, where I noticed that like that like, it's just. It's not just like me gaining like experience in the game, or it's it's helping like the Npc's storyline as well. But like 428 01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.960 huda: I feel like this is all like good. But I don't know how I'd be able to write it like 429 01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.010 huda: that. 430 01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.510 huda: Oh, without sounding like really 431 01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:36.219 huda: like a technical like, I feel like it would sound really technical. 432 01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.140",
    " huda: But. 433 01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.470 Jenny Duan: Hmm, okay. So 434 01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:47.010 Jenny Duan: so you're gonna play, you're gonna plant your character in this. 435 01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.990 Jenny Duan: Do they have an end goal 436 01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:55.179 Jenny Duan: like, it's empowering. Yeah, what is like the end goal. I still don't quite understand. Here. 437 01:01:55.890 --> 01:02:04.919 huda: Oh, the end goal was like, it's kind of like realizing that, like the people that are like, let's see, like the people that are part of empowering AI like, maybe like 438 01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:10.990 huda: they're gonna be like the players that I that they're gonna be like the characters that aren't really like played by the player, which is me 439 01:02:11.466 --> 01:02:21.269 huda: and so like, maybe like, I realized that like like helping like doing the empowering AI like quest has like helped 440 01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:33.620 huda: has like not just like given me, like experience, which kind of has a double meaning. Like the game experience as well as like an actual experience. But it's also like, helped 441 01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.870 huda: like the people. And like. 442 01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.960 huda: maybe. 443 01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:37.910 huda: like. 444 01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.140 huda: like, maybe like, I can like, come to like a realization that like 445 01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.390 huda: it's just like, don't just like, do these things, for. 446 01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:53.190 huda: like the heck of it, like, kind of just you're doing it. Cause you're like actually helping like the Npcs and everything. 447 01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.360 Jenny Duan: That's really cool. 448 01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:19.060 Jenny Duan: I feel like, though you shouldn't maybe center your game, your story, or your essay about empowering AI, though like, is there a way we can make it a separate game that encompasses things out outside empowering.",
    " AI, too, because I feel like that should be like, what element of your game. But I don't want to write your whole essay about empowering AI, because we might want to write about that in like a more specific like, oh, what do you like? 449 01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:22.810 Jenny Duan: More specifically tech essay or some other theme? 450 01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.450 huda: Be like 451 01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.879 huda: So like I think I discussed about like how my favorite game was like 452 01:04:02.313 --> 01:04:20.000 huda: mutazone and they talk about like, it's like one aspect of it. And like many other different types of games like that. They're often like, your like actions have consequences. And so I think that's like one angle we might be able to take from it 453 01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:29.440 huda: and so like, since we're not doing like empowering, AI is the main focus. Maybe it's just I could talk a little bit about something more personal. 454 01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.700 huda: like, for example, like 455 01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:39.819 huda: maybe like reading like classical literature 456 01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:50.249 huda: has like led me to enjoy writing a little bit better, and maybe have, like my increase my vocabulary, maybe, and maybe like 457 01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:12.259 huda: like in the game like, if we interact with like different people like in that game that I really enjoy like, there's like different like consequences. And like building like your story like, I don't know how it's like specific to me, though, like, that's like the problem. I don't know how to make it. 458 01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:15.120 Jenny Duan: You can insert these 21 facts in. 459 01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.748 huda: Yeah, yeah, I think so, too. 460 01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.070 huda: yeah. So maybe like these, like these, like things 461 01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:28.540 huda: happened for a reason. Or maybe I could talk about like. 462 01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:34.980 Jenny Duan: ",
    "Yeah, exactly. And they could all be like, like all these could be like challenges that your character has to overcome. For example, like 463 01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.880 Jenny Duan: you could be like oh, like you. 464 01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:41.800 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like dealt with this 465 01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:48.380 Jenny Duan: these like Msa. Boys, but now you're like part of the mia like you your character like lost, like 466 01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:54.389 Jenny Duan: 2 health points, or something, but like gain, like 50 experience like it could be like a game type of situation where they like. 467 01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:05.040 Jenny Duan: you know, have obstacles along the way, but, like you're still reaching that end, like I don't think there necessarily has to be an end. But, like, your character is like working towards the quest. And like. 468 01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:06.070 Jenny Duan: yeah. 469 01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:09.160 huda: Yeah, that sounds great. 470 01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.059 huda: so I'm like writing this 471 01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.705 huda: like, is there one that I should like, really, like, specifically, like, focus on or 472 01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:20.910 huda: kind of like listing. All of these would be like 473 01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.730 huda: most effective. 474 01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:29.239 Jenny Duan: Let's pick like 3 like experiences that your character faces. 475 01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:33.479 huda: I'm thinking that like maybe even like 476 01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:42.080 huda: I'm not sure if you've ever played like the Nintendo like pokemon games, but like there's like different, like attacks and stuff 477 01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.779 huda: and like, it's like you're kind of like battling one person 478 01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:50.019 huda: and then, like you said, like losing HP, and then like gaining experience. Stuff! 479 01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.307 huda: like that. It could. I could like narrate it that way. 480 0",
    "1:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.600 huda: Think. 481 01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 482 01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:59.810 Jenny Duan: so what? Okay, what are like, maybe 3 things 483 01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:03.690 Jenny Duan: people, you and your game are experiencing or fighting. 484 01:07:05.258 --> 01:07:14.199 Jenny Duan: The Msa thing could be one. These could also be positive, you know, like they could be like instances. Where are the experiences that have helped you grow as a person. 485 01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:44.399 huda: maybe like when I was younger, like having my sis, and I feel like this might be like overdone. But like having my sister like really like help me with everything and kind of giving me advice like resulted in me giving my brother advice, and like kind of like a chain effect. 486 01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:52.409 Jenny Duan: Okay. I feel like your sister can be a character who supports you on a quest. But I don't think she should be like 487 01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.969 Jenny Duan: our own quest. 488 01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:56.950 Jenny Duan: And that makes sense. Okay. 489 01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:03.349 huda: Yeah, what if? Like, okay, would it make sense? If, like, she was like a character who's like helping me? 490 01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:07.580 huda: like on a quest like, educate 491 01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:10.160 huda: like, or like help my brother at something like 492 01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:16.550 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's not. That's like about other people like your brother and your sister can be characters, but like 493 01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.490 Jenny Duan: you should be your own maker. 494 01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.240 huda: Okay. 495 01:08:21.028 --> 01:08:23.180 huda: so maybe not that example like 496 01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:40.109 huda: Maybe like I could do like kind of meeting like Mary Shelley in the game, who like she's like one of like the authors that I really like 497 01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:46.208 huda: and then, ",
    "like, I can like describe her and like doing like a quest with her, and then. 498 01:08:46.510 --> 01:09:13.030 Jenny Duan: That's that's still too much about other people. This has to be. You like Mary Shelley, like she's interesting. That's not you, though you can say, like the character has a Mary Shelley book in her backpack because she likes Mary Shelley. Character has, like Frankenstein or something. But like let's do like I think it has to be. You have to be like, extremely selfish in this essay, like you only have 600 words. You cannot be writing a long description about Mary Shelley has to be about you. 499 01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:26.739 huda: actually like, I don't know if that had like, too big of an impact on me, either. So. 500 01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.839 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, yeah. Then even less of an excuse to put her in. 501 01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:32.174 huda: Yeah, 502 01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:40.379 huda: I feel like, okay, so I kind of 503 01:09:42.219 --> 01:09:51.749 huda: I'm not sure like how to add, like a positive experience to like like, you know how we did like the Msa. Like kind of like fight scene, I guess. Like in the story 504 01:09:51.819 --> 01:10:01.119 huda: I'm like, how would I that. How would I be able to use like a positive effect like cause? If I'm trying to like like, for example, I'm trying to do like 505 01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:09.009 huda: oh, I was able to interact with like this person. And I was able to get this straight. But then again, like, that's like too much about another person. 506 01:10:11.409 --> 01:10:24.739 huda: maybe like like, would it be possible, like as my character like like the thing that I was talking about like my heirloom for my great grandma like maybe like I could be like my characters like wearing that those like earrings, and like. 507 01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.495 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 508 01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.080 huda: And like. 509 01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:43.500 huda: if this might be like t",
    "oo much, but like if I like, whenever like, I think about it, or if I like, I like touch it or something. Then then I think about like my great grandma, and like think about like oh, she would help me in this situation, but, like you said, I think, is that like not. 510 01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.190 huda: I feel like, would that be like to like away from me in the essay or. 511 01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.751 Jenny Duan: I think that's fine. 512 01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.179 Jenny Duan: I think that's not like a thing that yours your character experiences, though yet 513 01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:15.479 Jenny Duan: like they should be like concrete experiences like, for example, this Msa thing is big. Maybe J. Camp is big. What else is like big in your life, like perhaps like starting Full cliff like things like that, like the hackathon like. That's what I mean. Instead of like details, we want experiences. 514 01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:18.390 huda: Hmm! 515 01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.350 huda: Hmm! Hmm. 516 01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.380 Jenny Duan: That's why we talked about like what experiences make you you? 517 01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.670 Jenny Duan: That's what we want to insert here. 518 01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:47.418 huda: this is kind of tough. 519 01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.760 huda: maybe, like. 520 01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.180 huda: go 521 01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.710 huda: getting to 522 01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.360 huda: like. 523 01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:10.739 huda: maybe like founding founding folklift has helped me like. 524 01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:15.599 huda: be more like empathetic and like like kind of 525 01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:27.130 huda: change, my perspective on like how I see like different problems, like, for example, I'm starting to like, think of a lot more like like systemic issues about like 526 01:12:27.906 --> 01:12:29.260 huda: about like 527 01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.740 huda: women and like myself, and like South Asian identities 528 01:1",
    "2:35.080 --> 01:12:36.499 huda: that could be like one. 529 01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.769 Jenny Duan: Do you have a founding story for folklift like? Why, folklift. 530 01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:47.719 huda: Yeah, I think, definitely like in my community, like, since we didn't really have like stores and stuff. 531 01:12:48.555 --> 01:12:49.360 huda: So 532 01:12:49.370 --> 01:13:01.200 huda: like, maybe talking about like how like my small community of like Muslims, like they they often like, didn't have like the publicity, and like different like resources, is like the other 533 01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:09.089 huda: resources, such as like, you know, getting lots of like representation on like Facebook and everything despite like. 534 01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:17.800 huda: maybe like doing better or like having like cheaper prices like they just like weren't like featured many times on like Facebook groups and like 535 01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:27.560 huda: things like that. And then I'm building like folklift for them to like, you know, be able to talk about their stories, founding like their small businesses, and like not just like 536 01:13:28.355 --> 01:13:33.230 huda: and you know, like, just like about their process and starting it. 537 01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:39.660 huda: But yeah, I don't know if that's that's really like, I don't know if I can narrate that like. Interestingly enough. 538 01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.080 Jenny Duan: Okay. 539 01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:57.319 Jenny Duan: But if you can't think of experiences that have shaped you, I'm just gonna give you experiences that I think you could write about, and then you could just write about them, and we could go from there. 540 01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.769 Jenny Duan: Would that be better. 541 01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:00.022 huda: Yeah, I think so. 542 01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:08.218 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, let's talk about the Msa thing that's like one challenge that you overcame. Let's talk about 543 01:14:09.400 ",
    "--> 01:14:11.950 Jenny Duan: The process of hosting the hackathon. 544 01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:14.730 Jenny Duan: That seems really important to you. 545 01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.839 Jenny Duan: And then let's do like let's focus on like 546 01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:23.959 Jenny Duan: maybe one important interview that you did that changed like your perspective storytelling and journalism. 547 01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:27.310 Jenny Duan: How does that sound. 548 01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.540 huda: Yeah. 549 01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:50.830 huda: yeah, I think that sounds great. In terms of like the hackathon thing like. So the last thing it was kind of like a negative thing which was like oh, like these, like Ms. People won't like accept me, and, like I, I like, fought it, or whatever, and like I found, like I got experience like the Nyna. How would that work for like, I guess the other 2. And like maybe 550 01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:53.110 huda: specifically like the 551 01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:59.989 huda: founding like they're like the hackathon like, how would I be able to like kind of put it in like gaming format 552 01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.410 huda: that way? 553 01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.650 Jenny Duan: m 554 01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:24.620 Jenny Duan: Your character has to like. 555 01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.550 Jenny Duan: There's like a I don't know what's common trope games 556 01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:35.170 Jenny Duan: like meeting up with other super heroes, or like other characters, or like 557 01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:37.610 Jenny Duan: like some type of teamwork related thing 558 01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:40.380 Jenny Duan: I think about like they have to build a hackathon 559 01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:45.845 Jenny Duan: like something like that. And then for the interview. That's just like your character encountered someone. 560 01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:48.929 huda: Okay, that sounds good. 561 01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:52.320 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 562 01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:5",
    "5.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So I think 563 01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.770 Jenny Duan: we have a meeting tomorrow. I'm wondering, is this too short of a timeline to make progress on your essay. 564 01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:02.880 Jenny Duan: or do you wanna meet tomorrow. 565 01:16:03.607 --> 01:16:08.610 huda: I feel like I could use a little more time to like work on it. Maybe. 566 01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:16.910 Jenny Duan: Honestly, I was thinking about meeting Sunday night instead. Would that work for you, or do you already have a meeting on Sunday night? I need to double check. 567 01:16:18.513 --> 01:16:23.706 Jenny Duan: Yeah, would you wanna meet Sunday, or would you wanna meet like later on? We could also do that. 568 01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:28.040 huda: Work for me like, I'll double check with like. 569 01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.060 huda: yeah, I'll double check with my mom, and I'll let you know. 570 01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.860 Jenny Duan: Think we have a meeting set for 8 Pm. Sunday. If that still works. 571 01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.680 huda: Yeah. 572 01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:46.000 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool.
