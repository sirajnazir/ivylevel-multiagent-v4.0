How's it going. 2 00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.370 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.890 Jenny Duan: Good. It's kind of been a while. What have you been up to? How's life. 4 00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:44.859 huda: Yeah, I think it's it's been going great. I mean, like schools definitely intensifying because, we're like in our second quarter. So it's like, kind of 5 00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.509 huda: getting closer to finals. So it's getting a little tough in like this end. So been a bit occupied in that. But yeah, other than that. Not not much going on. 6 00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.460 Jenny Duan: Gotcha were you? Has the Elks Mvs. Has that already passed, or not? Yet. 7 00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.540 huda: Yeah, I submitted it like 8 00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.320 huda: perfect, I think, like a day after our call. 9 00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.080 Jenny Duan: Perfect. Okay. 10 00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.879 Jenny Duan: Today, let's talk about your Css profile, because to my understanding, that's due on November 15, th right? 11 00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.480 huda: Yeah. 12 00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.310 Jenny Duan: Do you have it open? And would you be able to share your screen so we can walk through that. 13 00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.310 huda: Yes. 14 00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:32.950 huda: I put in like I try to put in as many colleges as I can, but for some it wasn't letting me add any more. So. 15 00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.120 huda: But yeah. 16 00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.860 Jenny Duan: That's okay. 17 00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.330 Jenny Duan: And for you to send it, it's free, right? 18 00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:42.630 Jenny Duan: Actually, is it always free? Or do you get a fee waiver? I don't know. 19 00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.560 huda: I think it's a fee waiver thing. 20 00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.940 Jenny Duan: Cool. 21 00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.209 Jenny Duan: So I think the key here is to they ask you for, like your parents, income and assets. Right? So report that, like 22 00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.539 Jenny Duan: the do they ask you for previous tax statements, or do they ask you for this year's. 23 00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.889 huda: For previous and this year's. 24 00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.190 Jenny Duan: Okay. 25 00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.360 Jenny Duan: So 26 00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.069 Jenny Duan: I think, like, with your current financial circumstances like you should be eligible, for. 27 00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.309 Jenny Duan: like full financial aid at every single university, like at least like at the big ones. The offer 28 00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.481 Jenny Duan: so like that should be like what you're aiming for. 29 00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.178 Jenny Duan: what year did they ask for the financial statements like, how many years ago do they ask for like 2 years, one year. 30 00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:36.859 huda: They asked for the 2023 tax return form. And I think that's actually kind of working against me because actually, like my dad had like a lot of money from like like 31 00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:47.919 huda: kind of reimbursement or not reimbursement, but like like his old employment, like had paid him. But yeah, I think it's like not really working in our favor. But. 32 00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.079 Jenny Duan: I see, was your mom also working in 2023 as well? Or was she not. 33 00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.512 huda: Yes, yeah. She was. 34 00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.195 Jenny Duan: Okay, 35 00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.329 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine. 36 00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.849 Jenny Duan: like you like, you have to report just what it says, but 37 00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.790 Jenny Duan: does ask you about like 38 00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.349 Jenny Duan: it does ask you about this year's right that you can stop sharing right now if it's like telling the information like, I don't need to see like the exact numbers, but, like 39 00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.870 Jenny Duan: for this year's. Do they ask, do they ask you? They ask you about this year's too right. 40 00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:24.310 huda: Well, they can't like, I think they 41 00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.609 huda: they asked like roughly, like, how much like are your parents making? And so I gave like A rough estimate, I said. Like. 42 00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.700 huda: like, actually, I'm not even sure. 43 00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.310 Jenny Duan: Go like, like, go like, low, yeah, what? 44 00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:40.779 huda: Yes, I said, like 60,000 45 00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:52.129 huda: and then it also asked for like my dad's like stocks. And so I said, like like. I don't know how low it's like I should be like putting, because. 46 00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:54.670 Jenny Duan: You can say like 0. I feel like 47 00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.480 Jenny Duan: you can say 0. 48 00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.690 huda: Cause. There's like. 49 00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.340 huda: I think, like it says in like what counts as income, and it. 50 00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.870 Jenny Duan: So. 51 00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.240 huda: Business and stuff. 52 00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.120 huda: so I'm not sure. Let me open up. 53 00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:23.300 Jenny Duan: You should check with your dad about this, because it's not only like profit, but it's also like, because I know, for like this, like investing in a startup like he's also investing in it. Right? So he's like spending money to like build the business because he's not raising money for it so like that. Also, like you need to subtract that right from everything 54 00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.709 Jenny Duan: so like, I think you should talk to him about that, and like try to report it like 55 00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.815 Jenny Duan: Lower. 56 00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.050 huda: Yeah. 57 00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.839 Jenny Duan: Like as accurately as you can. 58 00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:47.179 Jenny Duan: That way you can maximize your financial aid. And then also, one thing is like, even if your tax returns are like from previous years that show higher numbers. After you get into like, for example, Stanford, you can say that you can file like 59 00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:59.449 Jenny Duan: an edit for for more financially, you can like that, file an appeal. And then in your appeal, you can like you get the chance to actually explain your situation, because I don't know if they give you the option to like. Write anything about your situation on this. 60 00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.370 huda: You told me. 61 00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:17.840 Jenny Duan: Oh, they do. Okay. So you can write like, then I would write like, you know, both your parents are not working like I would definitely write about that. And then, if Stanford doesn't, or if whatever school you know doesn't end up giving you like adequate financially, you can submit an appeal, and they usually will like give you more. 62 00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.419 Jenny Duan: because I think, as they justified in your circumstances. 63 00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:25.796 huda: And then I think they're also had like one about 64 00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.829 huda: they had 65 00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.909 huda: one about like the businesses. And then we have, we technically have like 2 66 00:05:33.297 --> 00:05:47.899 huda: and so for for my dad's business, I put that we're running on like, it's like he told me that it's like loss, it's running at a loss. So I think that might work in my favor. Let me see. 67 00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, report that like 68 00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.750 Jenny Duan: definitely. 69 00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.759 huda: yeah, and let me show you what I put for my special circumstances. Thing. 70 00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.180 Jenny Duan: Alright, cool. 71 00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:07.790 huda: So I said, chain of employment. 72 00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.880 huda: and then I kind of use the same like additional information. 73 00:06:14.622 --> 00:06:18.680 huda: Part. But I think I have space to like elaborate more, maybe, but. 74 00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.605 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 75 00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.439 Jenny Duan: maybe you should write that like your tax statements from 2023 don't actually reflect like 76 00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.230 Jenny Duan: your family's current financial circumstances. 77 00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.330 huda: Yeah. 78 00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so just like, make sure that that's really clear. 79 00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:47.179 Jenny Duan: Cause I like, I really think you should be eligible. For, like full financial aid from at least like Stanford would give you that 80 00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.770 Jenny Duan: and like all the private schools that you're applying to, would 81 00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.720 Jenny Duan: So 82 00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.760 Jenny Duan: you can say, like our financial situation has changed drastically from like 83 00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:14.559 Jenny Duan: the 2023 tax reports or something like that, to just specify that it's that situation with your current. 84 00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.480 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 85 00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.250 huda: I think I'll put that here. 86 00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. 87 00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.590 huda: Okay, does this look like? 88 00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.150 huda: Hmm. 89 00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.700 Jenny Duan: Maybe say our friend situation has changed drastically. 90 00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.199 Jenny Duan: and then I don't think you need to write that it's like inspired you to create. 91 00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.930 Jenny Duan: I don't think you should do that cause that like that's relevant for your additional information section. But it's not relevant for this, because, like. 92 00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.090 Jenny Duan: yeah, I don't care about that. It's a financial aid thing. Yeah. 93 00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.900 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay. 94 00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.600 Jenny Duan: But maybe actually say something about how like 95 00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.760 Jenny Duan: receiving financial aid is critical for my like ability to access college or something like that. 96 00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:45.689 Jenny Duan: or like, or maybe just say, you don't have to write receiving, you just say, like financial aid would be a critical 97 00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.449 Jenny Duan: need for my like college. 98 00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:57.060 Jenny Duan: I don't know journey, or for my ability to access college, or from my something like that. 99 00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:07.340 Jenny Duan: or for my family, or something financially, would be critical need for my family, or like something along those lines. Just emphasize that like, this is something that you need. 100 00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 101 00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.730 Jenny Duan: cool. 102 00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.470 huda: Right 103 00:09:22.421 --> 00:09:27.089 huda: and then this one's just I mean, like it says, like, what's your like? 104 00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.899 huda: First, st Major? Like 1st choice, Major? I guess. 105 00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.890 Jenny Duan: Write it out. I write science, technology and society parentheses, sts. 106 00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.769 huda: Yeah, actually like, it doesn't have space to write all. 107 00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.319 Jenny Duan: Then you can just write Sts. 108 00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.160 huda: Yeah. 109 00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.730 huda: and that's kind of all. 110 00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.320 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think you can just submit it. Then, whenever you're ready. 111 00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.249 huda: I think I'm gonna I think, like my dad was supposed to be on this call. But yeah, like. 112 00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.920 Jenny Duan: Come on! 113 00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:06.757 huda: Yeah, I think there's some things that I want to like. Make sure that he can go through. And it's like some of these aren't like completely like they're accurate, like, to my knowledge, but like 114 00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:15.350 huda: for example, like, if we get our tax tax return form later, and it's not like the same would that like penalize me? 115 00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:26.760 Jenny Duan: No, just report it to the most accurate that you can. But for your income and your assets you can write 0 like, it's okay, if you have savings like, you can just like, write 0 like it's there. 116 00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.060 Jenny Duan: Do like that stuff. I would just like, report it like low for students 117 00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.930 Jenny Duan: doesn't for parent, you need to be real like, be accurate 118 00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.019 Jenny Duan: for student, you can. 119 00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.619 huda: Oh, yeah, for student, I said, 0, because I haven't worked like. 120 00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.740 Jenny Duan: Okay. Okay? Then, you're fine. Yeah, like, if you have savings from like any like 121 00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:53.759 Jenny Duan: like birthday, crisp like birthday eat or like, I don't know Ramadan. Money like anything like that. If you've ever like received money, just don't report. It doesn't matter. 122 00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.170 Jenny Duan: Also, like 123 00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.440 Jenny Duan: for your for your family, like parent houses and stuff like 124 00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:05.170 Jenny Duan: if it's cash, just don't report it like that's 1 thing. Only report what they can trace. 125 00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:13.718 Jenny Duan: Or if it's like super substantial, then you have to report it. But if it's like a little bit and don't have to report it 126 00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.577 Jenny Duan: for business losses, like, I think, make sure that that's accurate. 127 00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.710 Jenny Duan: and like income and stuff like 128 00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.419 Jenny Duan: income is like profits minus losses. So just make sure that you take that into account 129 00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.620 Jenny Duan: when it comes to family. 130 00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 131 00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:31.730 huda: Correct. 132 00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.350 Jenny Duan: Do you want to ask your dad to get on this call, or you can check with him later, too, and submit it. 133 00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.283 huda: Yeah, I think he's a he's a bit 134 00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.089 huda: busy. Actually. Let me send the join link to him again. 135 00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.300 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. If he's busy. That's fine. I think. 136 00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.200 Jenny Duan: like, I think, regardless of what happens. 137 00:11:51.400 --> 00:12:00.280 Jenny Duan: you will probably might. You probably might have to submit an appeal just because your tax records like they're from, they ask for between 23 tax records. And so 138 00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:15.419 Jenny Duan: I think, like, if they go off of that. Then you're just gonna have to submit, appeal and appeal regardless and like, they're usually pretty generous with appeals like this year. I submitted a financial appeal. And I got like an extra 10,000 from Stanford because of that. So like. 139 00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:24.680 Jenny Duan: And then in your situation, it'd be like even more, because obviously your parents aren't working. So I think maybe just expect to submit an appeal like, regardless of. 140 00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:35.549 Jenny Duan: What happens here. But I think, for here, like obviously to the Mo. To your knowledge, like reporting the like, a lower amount is always going to be more advantageous for you. 141 00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:36.860 huda: But 142 00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:43.450 huda: okay, yeah, that that sounds great. I think. Then I'll just go over it again, with with my dad, yeah. 143 00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.810 Jenny Duan: And as long as it's like accurate, it's fine, like. 144 00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:52.010 Jenny Duan: I think there's not too much you can really do with financial aid. Besides, at this point. Besides, like 145 00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.600 Jenny Duan: I mean, like 146 00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.179 Jenny Duan: what people do for financial aid is like 147 00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.030 Jenny Duan: if you oh, here he is! 148 00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.069 Jenny Duan: Hi!

I mean, let me also give 150 00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.400 Siraj Nazir: the link to 151 00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.720 Siraj Nazir: oh. 152 00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.839 Siraj Nazir: you know. Maria, actually my wife's also joining. How are you doing? 153 00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.379 Jenny Duan: I'm good. Yeah. 154 00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.560 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean a bit intense. I was actually involved with you know, Arnav Arnav's dad actually. 155 00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.470 Jenny Duan: Oh, gosh! What happened? 156 00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:31.440 Siraj Nazir: No, I mean, I don't like, you know, he I don't know if you know right, but you see, like he's been playing his own playbook, and then I think he's fixated 157 00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:37.639 Siraj Nazir: with debate. You know it's such a low return of investment. But I mean parents to be blamed to be very honest. 158 00:13:38.215 --> 00:13:43.589 Siraj Nazir: But yeah, I mean, you know, the thing was like he was literally like, in in the whole one year 159 00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.930 Siraj Nazir: he just took like 9 sessions. Can you imagine. 160 00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.170 Jenny Duan: No, what can you really do in 9 sessions? You can't. 161 00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.840 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, nothing 162 00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.870 Siraj Nazir: right? And then. 163 00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.180 Jenny Duan: Change, no possible change in 9 sessions. 164 00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.710 Siraj Nazir: That's you. 165 00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.910 Jenny Duan: Over one year. 166 00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:03.050 Siraj Nazir: Okay, Mariam, join. Actually, she wait a minute. Yeah, you did. Oh, she did. Okay. 167 00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.489 Jenny Duan: It is. Yeah. 168 00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.290 Siraj Nazir: I live. 169 00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.899 Jenny Duan: Hello! We! Who didn't I just finish talking about? Hello! Nice to meet you. 170 00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:13.215 huda: You're muted. 171 00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.499 Siraj Nazir: You're muted. Varia. Yeah. So 172 00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:36.460 Siraj Nazir: yeah, I mean, actually, you know, we we were all like collecting all the profiles today, Jenny. You know different images, etc. Right? So I was also looking. And actually, I somehow ended up in your like, 3 year old photo, or like 4 year old picture. 173 00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.869 Siraj Nazir: I think it's in the fencing, I think. Probably fencing website. 174 00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.430 Jenny Duan: Oh, wow! Wait! 175 00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.640 Siraj Nazir: It was so funny. 176 00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:53.150 Siraj Nazir: And you just looked like Huda. Actually, you know, Huda was also, like, you know, I I remember Huda. I didn't share it with anyone, you know, but I think Huda can figure it out. 177 00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.590 Jenny Duan: Boards. Okay, let me. I'll look for I don't have that many 178 00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.630 Jenny Duan: chorus. 179 00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.019 Jenny Duan: Actually, I just got an award. So maybe I'll put that photo. 180 00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.940 Jenny Duan: But yeah, who did I just finish talking about her css, profile? 181 00:15:14.272 --> 00:15:39.689 Jenny Duan: I think, regardless of what happens, she'll probably have to submit an appeal for financial aid. I think that Huda should be eligible for full financial aid, like a full ride at pretty much any private college she goes to. But I think she'll probably have to submit an appeal, because all the tax forms that they asked for are 2023, and so to submit. Like her most recent financial statements like she'll probably have to make an appeal after she gets into the institution. 182 00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.829 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think we we really needed a kind of a 1 on one, too, you know, like. 183 00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.129 Siraj Nazir: you know, because I think there's just so many forms. 184 00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.150 Siraj Nazir: And 185 00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.020 Siraj Nazir: yeah, let me. 186 00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.239 Siraj Nazir: I mean, so Mariam is joining mommy's joining or work. 187 00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.990 huda: I think her audio wasn't working. 188 00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.890 Siraj Nazir: Her is not working, and she has a new laptop. 189 00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:07.493 Siraj Nazir: Might be, you know. I don't. Yeah, I mean, she goes on, calls as well. Right? So, okay, so, 190 00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.249 Siraj Nazir: yeah, Jenny, I think 191 00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:15.250 Siraj Nazir: you know, might be just like taking a step back, you know, kind of just give us like an overview on 192 00:16:15.734 --> 00:16:21.615 Siraj Nazir: you know, at least from my understanding as well, because there's so so many terms and technical difficulties. Right? So 193 00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:33.649 Siraj Nazir: I think one of the key challenges is that and I don't know what classifications of financial need need based, not need based. I mean, that's also confusing, but might be very simple, because you have spent a lot of time there. 194 00:16:34.096 --> 00:16:36.450 Siraj Nazir: The key question I have is this. 195 00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:40.739 Siraj Nazir: the challenge that we have is, like, you know. 196 00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.229 Siraj Nazir: 2,000. 197 00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:51.978 Siraj Nazir: there is Fafsa, and there is the Css profile as well. Hopefully Fafsa exists under under the new administration. But 198 00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.492 Siraj Nazir: The thing is, 199 00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.740 Siraj Nazir: 2,000. 200 00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.439 Siraj Nazir: The tax returns of 2,003 201 00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.299 Siraj Nazir: which is like, you know. Like, I mean. So also this year is 2,000. Yeah, this is 2024. 202 00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:12.620 Siraj Nazir: So last year, 2023, we would have filed for 20. Yeah. 20. Sorry. 203 00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.369 Siraj Nazir: How does it work? Again? 204 00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:21.409 Siraj Nazir: 2023 we would have filed for like 2020 like. Which tax return did I give you. 205 00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:21.979 huda: You gave me the. 206 00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.570 Jenny Duan: 23. 207 00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:23.539 huda: 23. 208 00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:33.996 Siraj Nazir: 23, right? So see? Like. So, Jenny, on 23, right? Like, you know, the income is quite high. Right? So because that's the year that I you know. 209 00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.350 Siraj Nazir: that's the year I left, like, you know, Google. And 210 00:17:37.798 --> 00:17:42.600 Siraj Nazir: of course, I mean it, even though it was a layoff, like, you know, we got like a lump sum kind of. 211 00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.390 Siraj Nazir: So it's a it's a huge. Unfortunately, it doesn't help with our right, because 212 00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:55.529 Siraj Nazir: it was it was. It was quite, you know, for it was a good package, right? So I think. Unfortunately, we won't be able to show anything with 2023, 213 00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.900 Siraj Nazir: 2024. I have done my best 214 00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:16.560 Siraj Nazir: to keep it like below, like, you know, 60 grand or something like that, and I know there are a lot of loopholes and stuff like that as a business right might be. There's a lot of benefits, and I've worked with my attorney as well. I mean. All I can show is, like, you know, completely lost making business. We can move around money and all that stuff we can do things like, you know, like to avail the loophole? 215 00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:27.030 Siraj Nazir: so you know, just like, you know, let us know. Like, How do? What should we do? Because it, you know. Clearly she doesn't qualify for Fafsa right? Based on the 2023 earnings. 216 00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:56.329 Jenny Duan: so okay, the difference. So that there's 2 documents that who don't need to submit 1st is the Fafsa which is for federal aid. This will confirm her eligibility, for, like pell grants and government aid, so filling out the Fafsa will be really good if you can confirm your pell, grant eligibility, Pell Grant. Eligibility is important because it unlocks like different programs, like in scholarships. Later on, for example, like the Gates Foundation scholarship, I think, is only for students who receive pell grants 217 00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:20.080 Jenny Duan: or who are Pell grant eligible. So that's 1 piece. The Css. Profile is what every school uses to calculate, like the financial aid package offered by the school. So what Stanford uses is a combination of the Fafsa and the Css. Profile. The Css. Profile asks more questions than the Fafsa does. So it's a little bit more specific now in the Css. Profile there's a section to explain, like your current circumstances as well as what you 218 00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:43.009 Jenny Duan: what your current family income is. So I think Huda is using that to her advantage to explain that both parents are not working right now that her financial situation has changed drastically from 2023. So what I think will happen is the school that she gets into. So let's just use Stanford as an example, but, like any top private school that has, like competitive financial aid, will probably offer her an initial package. 219 00:19:43.326 --> 00:20:10.849 Jenny Duan: That may or may not be comprehensive now, I think Huda should be eligible for full financial aid. I think, from most of these private institutions that she's applying for, but what that will entail is after she gets in. She'll likely need to file an appeal to the school financial Aid office to explain that like this was the situation on my Css. Profile. But here is what my family is experiencing right now, and after filing that appeal they will probably make a new aid. 220 00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:19.149 Siraj Nazir: Okay, okay, yeah. So so I think, whatever goes in the current css, profile right now is only for the 2023. Unfortunately, right? 221 00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.699 Jenny Duan: But there was an option for you to write in what 222 00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.840 Jenny Duan: your parents are currently making right. 223 00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:33.990 huda: Yeah, there's actually a section on the Css which asks you to kind of like estimate how much the 2024 income is and. 224 00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.379 Siraj Nazir: Wanna display to the, I think let's go through the form right? Because 225 00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.986 Siraj Nazir: might be 226 00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.709 Siraj Nazir: I mean, especially the areas where it's about the current, the what we are currently making right. 227 00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.030 huda: And. 228 00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:57.029 Siraj Nazir: Also, like, you know, Jenny, these assets and stuff like that. See? The thing is like, I really want to use any loophole. We want to be ethical, and we want to be very accurate, but I think at the same time, you know, if there are things that we don't have to report. We don't have to report, you know. 229 00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:07.839 Siraj Nazir: because think about stocks. Now, right like, you know, people can have stocks. People can have money. People can have like liquid assets, you know. I I don't know, like I don't know how much of this is really going to be verified. 230 00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:10.930 Siraj Nazir: So I think I, we need some guidance there 231 00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:11.825 Siraj Nazir: because 232 00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.980 Siraj Nazir: and and also like, you know, I'm sure that at the end of the day any form is really. 233 00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.940 Siraj Nazir: you know, their whole goal with the form is to find ways by which they can actually eliminate someone, you know. 234 00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:34.359 Siraj Nazir: So you know. So so like, you know. Put on your like Fafsa and Css hat, and and tell us, because I know that you know people actually avail a lot of loopholes here. And why not? You know. 235 00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:48.279 Jenny Duan: The best loophole is, I believe they don't ask you about the value of your current home, so if you have any mortgages on your home, or if you have anything, any like debt on your home at all, I would try to pay that off, and because I don't think 236 00:21:48.280 --> 00:22:13.750 Jenny Duan: they count the value of the home that you're living in as an asset like, for example, if you have money in the bank, they're going to count that. But if you have a value on your current property, so not any additional properties, but like the house that you live in now, I don't think they count that. So that would be something like, if you have any debt or any like leverage on your home like, try to put your assets into that, because that doesn't count your Fafsa. 237 00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.860 huda: So first.st 238 00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:19.590 Siraj Nazir: What kind of asset? Sorry like, what kind of asset are you using. 239 00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:28.819 Jenny Duan: They look for your stock portfolio, your like savings, accounts, and basically anything that you report on your taxes is going to be asked for on this. 240 00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.819 Siraj Nazir: So so so see? I, okay. So now there are 2 things here, right? And that's what I said. Now, the thing with 241 00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:41.179 Siraj Nazir: So the only thing that's verifiable at this point an official document is actually your 242 00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:48.489 Siraj Nazir: the what is that tax return? I mean, I'm like, it's the what's that? 1 0 9 9 w. 2 w, 2, like tax 243 00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.890 Siraj Nazir: return form. Right? Whatever I shared with you. Rightula. 244 00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.130 Siraj Nazir: yeah. 245 00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.340 Siraj Nazir: So. 246 00:22:54.340 --> 00:23:04.090 huda: One. Also, I wanted to add that in this Dss profile it actually asked for like the current homes value and like how much we've paid so far. 247 00:23:04.412 --> 00:23:08.370 huda: I think it might be different from the Fafsa in that way. But yeah. 248 00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.070 Jenny Duan: Oh, they do ask for that. Okay, I see. I don't think. 249 00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:24.450 Siraj Nazir: This is all not act like, you know, this is the point, right? We have been like, you know, just like pick one number kind of a thing, because at the end of the day, like, of course, it's not this amount. It's it's more. But I mean, I can always like, you know, as a business, we can always show that 250 00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.820 Siraj Nazir: it's the balance that eventually I you know, it's all reinvested, or probably I can pick. 251 00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.799 Jenny Duan: I think the income can be 252 00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:39.570 Jenny Duan: 0 like, I honestly don't think that you can. You need to report that because I think because you're still investing in this business, like 253 00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.529 Jenny Duan: income is like 254 00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.439 Jenny Duan: profits minus losses. Right? So if you're like costs are higher than like. 255 00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.119 Jenny Duan: it's okay. I think you don't need to report that. 256 00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.929 Siraj Nazir: And that's like. 257 00:23:48.930 --> 00:24:01.159 Jenny Duan: You're you're you're self employed. You don't have a tax you don't like. I don't know you're not being. You're not receiving like w nines every month, or W fours or anything. So it's I don't think you need to report that actually. 258 00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.760 Siraj Nazir: Okay, that's great. Actually, let's see, these were the things that 259 00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.869 Siraj Nazir: I was freaking out as well. Because, see, I don't want to provide any information where 260 00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:26.599 Siraj Nazir: they verify, and they come to know. And and I told you that the only official document they have to be verified is actually the tax return like which of the document can like, for example, even my stocks right like, how many stocks have I used this year, or like bought new stocks like, how would they know about it unless I file it next year? Correct. 261 00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.030 Siraj Nazir: So. 262 00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.210 Jenny Duan: Wait, scroll up. 263 00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.480 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. So we don't have to disclose. Everything is. My point is that. 264 00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.490 Jenny Duan: You should. You should say that you should report you received Snap this year, don't you, Ludo? 265 00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.550 Jenny Duan: Assisted lunch program. 266 00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.629 Jenny Duan: Wait! I I just saw that page. I'm not sure what it was referring to. 267 00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:56.499 huda: Yeah, wait, let me go back. But I think that might be like us, cause I don't know if I actually apply for it, because in California, like obviously, they, they give free lunch to everyone. So I don't know if there's like that program like. 268 00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.290 Maryam: It's in Lusd, it is free lunch. 269 00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.440 Maryam: Alright. 270 00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.000 huda: Oh, I thought it was for entire California, but. 271 00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.960 Maryam: No, not Usd and other schools. 272 00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.400 huda: Let me go back! 273 00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.099 Jenny Duan: Yeah, go back to that page. 274 00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:49.780 huda: Also over here. It says, do they expect like a significant income change in 2025? I said, no, because 275 00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.900 huda: I mean, like, it's already, I think 2024 276 00:25:53.422 --> 00:25:56.320 huda: is like the is where the change happened. 277 00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:57.410 huda: So 278 00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:02.560 huda: yeah, here. 279 00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:09.210 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would say, yes, get that because you don't. You receive cow boxes like, that's the same thing. 280 00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.180 Jenny Duan: Okay. 281 00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.370 Jenny Duan: yeah. 282 00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:15.720 Jenny Duan: Do. 283 00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.070 Jenny Duan: are you on free or reduced price. Lunch? Yes. 284 00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.980 Jenny Duan: yes. 285 00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.370 Jenny Duan: okay. 286 00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.050 Jenny Duan: great. And then 287 00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:31.470 Jenny Duan: I think everything that can be tracked to a tax form needs to be reported correctly. 288 00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.070 huda: There's no. 289 00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:36.450 Jenny Duan: Way around that, but you can report 290 00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.159 Jenny Duan: business losses if you did that. 291 00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:49.909 huda: Oh, also here, instead of saying, like like the actual company that my dad worked at just a text. 292 00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.609 Jenny Duan: You don't have to be that specific. 293 00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.649 Jenny Duan: They're super nosy. You don't need to disclose everything. 294 00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.769 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, yeah, I think that's our point. See? At the end of the day 295 00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:07.760 Siraj Nazir: what can cause an alarm right? When, if you give an inaccurate information about your tax return. Then I I can agree. Right? That's the only thing that's verifiable. 296 00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:08.870 Jenny Duan: Yes. 297 00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.310 huda: Yeah, see? They they ask about like, the. 298 00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.830 Jenny Duan: Your value of your house. Okay, it's fine. 299 00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:23.490 Jenny Duan: it's fine. I mean, you live in the Bay Area. So housing prices are just inflated because of that. And they know that. So that's okay. 300 00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.270 Jenny Duan: let's see. 301 00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.184 huda: Then, after this it asked about like my siblings. 302 00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.630 Jenny Duan: Yes, you have one sibling in in college. Make sure you report that, and then you have another sibling. 303 00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.470 huda: And then I also asked about, like my sister's, like 304 00:27:40.045 --> 00:27:41.710 huda: tuition, and everything. 305 00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:48.370 Jenny Duan: Tell her. Tell them your tuition, and oh, you can increase this cost. The total cost to attend the school 306 00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:59.870 Jenny Duan: include everything, her housing, her tuition her the gas it costs to drive between schools like anything that she would spend in college. You need to include all of it. 307 00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.009 Jenny Duan: Because, yeah, like that is good. Because then, like. 308 00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:15.009 Jenny Duan: they'll see that like, you have more expenses. And like, yeah, just this is something you can report up like, basically anything that costs her to go to school, anything related to school. You report it here. 309 00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.540 huda: Yeah, I'm gonna 310 00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:23.650 huda: say, I don't know if this is talking about all 4 years. But I'm gonna see, like around 70,000 for all 4 years. 311 00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.350 Jenny Duan: I think this is maybe like we can scroll up, maybe like one per year. 312 00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.200 huda: Oh, okay. 313 00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.420 Jenny Duan: Per year, do it per year. 314 00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.350 huda: Watch this already too much, then. 315 00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:34.430 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 316 00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.310 huda: I'll just say 50. 317 00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:43.740 Jenny Duan: Tuition fees for housing food supplies, any textbooks the cost to drive like back and forth like 318 00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:48.650 Jenny Duan: the clothes that she's buying for school like anything like that can all be counted here. 319 00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.489 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but 320 00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.470 Jenny Duan: don't over inflate it too much, because like. 321 00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.200 Jenny Duan: but just do something that you feel like encompasses all the educational expenses. 322 00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.510 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 323 00:29:00.483 --> 00:29:02.680 huda: Do you think this is accurate, Paula? 324 00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:15.029 Siraj Nazir: I mean, education expenses would include everything right like you know. It's not just for like, only for Samia, right. 325 00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.490 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, only for her sister. 326 00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.710 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean, is there a way for them to verify like? Is it only. 327 00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:26.369 Jenny Duan: They can check the cost of attendance for the school, so like they can look up like Cal Poly. Cost of attendance. 328 00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.039 Maryam: Apart from that, the housing is like 15,000. 329 00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:32.870 Maryam: Is it. 330 00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.590 Siraj Nazir: Is it only like tuition or tuition, or what. 331 00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.980 Maryam: No, it's everything. 332 00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.939 Jenny Duan: Everything. Tuition housing her meal. Plan? Yeah. 333 00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.670 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, okay. 334 00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:44.800 Jenny Duan: Fine. Then it's fine. 335 00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.720 Maryam: So it's 40 50,000, I think, would be perfect. I think. 336 00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:57.219 Jenny Duan: 50,000. Yeah, because they can. They can look it up, too. So it shouldn't be too high, because they know you live. They know, you're in state. So that's yeah. 337 00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.869 huda: Yeah, I think 50,000. 338 00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 339 00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:03.529 huda: Good. Yeah. 340 00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:04.010 Jenny Duan: Okay. 341 00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.340 huda: The same for this. 342 00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.429 Maryam: Oh, it's just. 343 00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.800 huda: Oh. 344 00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.569 huda: you know what. 345 00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.840 Maryam: That's 4,000. 346 00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.520 huda: Or 347 00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.710 huda: 40. 348 00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.402 huda: Yeah. And then this 349 00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.859 huda: most of the stuff was not applicable. And for the college programs I put in. 350 00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.159 huda: Stanford, Usc, Georgia, Tech. 351 00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.970 Maryam: That's. 352 00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.459 huda: Eastern Northeastern, Unc. 353 00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:12.319 huda: Bernard Cornell, Nyu Carnegie, Mellon Brown University. I was trying to add, like uiuc, but for some reason it doesn't. I don't think they accept Css. 354 00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.119 Jenny Duan: Not every school accepts. Css, yeah. 355 00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.350 huda: Yeah. 356 00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.250 huda: Then I think I think that's all for the Css form. 357 00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.330 huda: You guys, do you guys think I should submit it? No. 358 00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:38.240 Siraj Nazir: So I think to summarize right again. It's very important to internalize this, Maria, and you know it's it's going to be confusing. So css, now, profile that so this is this per college, or is this like one common thing? Jenny. 359 00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.030 Jenny Duan: It's 1 common thing that's sent to all the colleges. 360 00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.769 Siraj Nazir: Full form of Css. Just curious. 361 00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.000 Jenny Duan: It's just like, so they can get more information out of you. 362 00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.589 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's not. That's it. 363 00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.539 Siraj Nazir: And Fafsa form, like, you know. So Css. Goes to a particular college. 364 00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.370 Jenny Duan: It goes to every college that you put on your list. 365 00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:05.060 Siraj Nazir: Okay. So Huda has to specify all the colleges now, or one by one right, whenever she's applying right, it will go as like an addendum or a pack attachment? Yeah. 366 00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah, basically. 367 00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:07.610 Jenny Duan: okay, so. 368 00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:14.000 Siraj Nazir: So. If I remember correctly, you said sorry. I'm a bit distracted with this customer once today. Unfortunately. 369 00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.500 Jenny Duan: Problem. 370 00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.109 Siraj Nazir: So basically, you're saying that 371 00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:25.729 Siraj Nazir: now it goes. Of course, you know, Huda Huda doesn't really like look, you know, of course, you know the the 2023, unfortunately, is not a low income thing. But then 372 00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:33.030 Siraj Nazir: you have entered that. You know, this year. Of course, there are circumstances right? So that's kind of the additional information so hopefully. 373 00:32:33.747 --> 00:32:36.309 Siraj Nazir: But when a decision is made. 374 00:32:37.074 --> 00:32:43.669 Siraj Nazir: so help you know. Explain that as well, because Marim is also on the call, like, you know, the need blind versus like. 375 00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:51.120 Siraj Nazir: how does that work, Jenny? Like? So this goes now, Stanford and all the top schools. Right? They're expensive schools. 376 00:32:51.120 --> 00:33:02.860 Jenny Duan: They don't see this when they make your decision. So if, for example, at Stanford, they guarantee you aid, so your financial aid is not like attached to your application. They don't see it unless you are admitted. 377 00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:27.280 Jenny Duan: And then, after you're admitted, they can see that like. Okay, this is this will calculate an estimated family contribution. I think it will tell you after you submit. Maybe your estimated family contribution, which is like how much they estimate that you'll be able to pay at these institutions, and usually the school will then give you financial aid, so that you only pay your estimated financial contribution. So if your estimated financial contribution is 378 00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:43.350 Jenny Duan: 15,000, then they'll give you aid, so that you only pay 15,000. If it's 0, then they'll give you aid, so you only pay 0. But this has no bearing on whether or not you are admitted. So this is only on financial aid. If they're need blind, which means they don't look at your need for financial aid when they admit you. 379 00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.110 Siraj Nazir: In most of the colleges are deemed blind right. 380 00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.810 Jenny Duan: Yes. 381 00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.370 Siraj Nazir: And which colleges are need based. 382 00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.840 Siraj Nazir: like. 383 00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.899 Jenny Duan: No school that you would want to go to. Most of, like the top schools are all are all blind. 384 00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.339 Siraj Nazir: You. You see that right, Mariel. I think that's a key point here. Right? So 385 00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:11.669 Siraj Nazir: But again, like, you know, there are ways probably like. So I mean with the affirmative law, you know, it's not even like there are no prompts anymore. Right? That actually talk about your 386 00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.610 Siraj Nazir: gender identity and background, and all that stuff. 387 00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:29.959 Siraj Nazir: But still, like, you know, there are narratives that people mentioned, but they cannot. Technically they cannot use it. That was the whole Howard thing that came out right on how they were trying to like make decisions based on different kind of factors. Correct, Jenny, is that what it is. 388 00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:35.739 Jenny Duan: Not. This is not a weight into your decision like this will only come after you are admitted. 389 00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.409 Maryam: Okay? And then what's it? 390 00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:38.629 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! Sorry. 391 00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:43.600 Maryam: No. What's the difference between Csn and Fafsa? 392 00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:56.750 Jenny Duan: Used to calculate Federal aid. So Fasa is what the Government uses to calculate whether or not the Government will give you a loan or a grant, for example, a Pell grant. But Css. Is for every school to calculate, like through their own financial aid system. 393 00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:57.930 Maryam: Oh yes! 394 00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:11.339 Jenny Duan: Css. Is not used for government aid. Yeah? And then, after you get admitted, Huda, like I said, there's a high likelihood that you'll need to file an appeal. So most likely the initial offer they give you is not going to be like 395 00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:27.689 Jenny Duan: as much financial aid that you'll get in the long term in the at the end, because you'll probably need to file another appeal to explain to Re, explain your situation because of those 2023 tax records, but after you appeal they should be able to increase your aid. 396 00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:29.719 Jenny Duan: To be more accurate. Yeah. 397 00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.779 huda: Alright also, I had a question for this one. It says, like 398 00:35:34.194 --> 00:35:42.960 huda: how much does what they expect to receive from the following resources to pay for educational expenses for the 2025 to 26 academic year. 399 00:35:43.404 --> 00:35:44.700 huda: I don't know. Like 400 00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.179 huda: I don't know if I'm supposed to make this like a larger number, or a smaller number. 401 00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.130 Jenny Duan: So 402 00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.530 Jenny Duan: maybe you can just say like 5,000 would be fine. 403 00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:04.320 Jenny Duan: or maybe 1,000 is also fine, like I think you'll you'll be eligible for full aid. So I don't really think it like, I think 1,000 is fine here. 404 00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.320 Jenny Duan: Then, yeah, obviously, don't say you're gonna do scholarships. Don't say you're gonna do employers or anything. Yeah. 405 00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.310 Jenny Duan: And then 406 00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:25.639 Jenny Duan: a little bit careful about reporting business losses, because I think earlier, you mentioned that your Dad's unemployed. I don't think you said he was a small business owner, so if you're reporting like business losses, that might be a bit contradictory. 407 00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.769 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? You know. 408 00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.170 Jenny Duan: Or I don't know what the exact prompt was for that. 409 00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:40.270 huda: Yeah, actually, I might, instead of saying unemployed, I could change it to self employed. I don't know which one gives me a more advantage. 410 00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.150 huda: Yeah. 411 00:36:41.628 --> 00:36:43.540 Jenny Duan: Self-employed would be good. 412 00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.170 Jenny Duan: because if you're going to report business any losses, then there has to be like some type of employment there. 413 00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.270 Siraj Nazir: I mean, but it is important to report the businesses now right. 414 00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.630 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Report as many losses as you can. 415 00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.809 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. See? That's the that's the loophole here. Yeah. 416 00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:08.290 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So whatever you're investing into ivy level like, just report that as a loss like, it's very. 417 00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.444 Siraj Nazir: So how does that get verified right 418 00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.059 Siraj Nazir: And Jenny, like. 419 00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:23.110 Jenny Duan: If you file like an independent contractor's tax, it's just whatever you report on your tax form. So if you're filing losses on your taxes, then should match this. 420 00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.910 Siraj Nazir: Okay? So basically, yeah, it's gonna be that 1 0 9 9 form, right? 421 00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:27.790 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 1090. 422 00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:31.120 huda: I? I said that. I said that 423 00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:41.829 huda: the Iv level was actually started, or like filed in 2024 because I didn't. I checked our forms, and I couldn't find any like specific numbers. 424 00:37:42.194 --> 00:37:48.900 huda: So then I just, I just mentioned that like, oh, we started in 2024. But it's running at a loss. 425 00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.049 Siraj Nazir: It was actually in 2023, actually. So 426 00:37:52.395 --> 00:37:57.764 Siraj Nazir: yeah, it's always been reported as loss as well. Yeah. So let's let's connect on that 427 00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.639 Siraj Nazir: I did file it to with with Delaware. Actually. So. 428 00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.489 huda: It's a different trial cause, cause I didn't see it in the. 429 00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:13.179 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, yeah, it's not there. It's it's separate. It was separately filed right? I I filed the business separately. So. 430 00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.093 Siraj Nazir: but I think last year again. So 431 00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:26.749 Siraj Nazir: there was no earning, basically might be there was some earning. But there, like, I think, I think, in the in the tax filing like we did not really pay any taxes or anything of that sort. So 432 00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:34.450 Siraj Nazir: so we have to show losses. Right? I mean, is there a particular form like a field or something Jenny, that basically talks about. 433 00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:39.959 Jenny Duan: There, there should be a field about losses, so I think you should look. Take a look for that 434 00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:42.339 Jenny Duan: cause. That will be important. 435 00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.670 Siraj Nazir: Okay. 436 00:38:45.222 --> 00:38:48.249 Siraj Nazir: and we also have shams right? Without the other one. 437 00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.439 huda: Yeah, I found that one. 438 00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.039 Jenny Duan: And yeah, income can be 0. That should be. 439 00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.280 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 440 00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.740 Siraj Nazir: so is there a specific field that says we incurred losses or. 441 00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.369 Jenny Duan: I think Sohuda like, did you? 442 00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.790 Jenny Duan: And you're filling. 443 00:39:04.197 --> 00:39:05.420 huda: Let me show 444 00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:08.690 huda: it's like, there's basically there's. 445 00:39:09.093 --> 00:39:11.109 Siraj Nazir: If you can. I mean. 446 00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.670 huda: Yeah, you have to go through like a bunch of pages. That's why it's taking me so long. 447 00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:21.220 Siraj Nazir: Okay, yeah. Just just hop onto like a seams is like another kind of small business, like, you know, my wife's business. 448 00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.364 huda: Yeah, so it has like one page for each for each business. 449 00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.900 huda: let me go to that. 450 00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:32.110 huda: Okay. 451 00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.769 huda: okay, so I said, 2 businesses. 452 00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.290 huda: this one. 453 00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.750 huda: And I said that the market value is $10,000. 454 00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.620 huda: but I don't know if this should. This should. 455 00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.200 huda: I don't know if this is 456 00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.720 huda: how I'm supposed to fill it out. But 457 00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:57.860 huda: I didn't. 458 00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.309 Jenny Duan: Market value. Maybe I would say. 459 00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:05.270 Jenny Duan: market value. What is market value? 460 00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.300 Jenny Duan: Oh. 461 00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.880 huda: That's wait. This could be 0, right? 462 00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.349 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it could be 0. 463 00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:14.080 huda: Yeah. 464 00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.749 Jenny Duan: How much do you owe on the business. 465 00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.780 huda: Yeah, I checked the forms. And this is. 466 00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.840 huda: I think 467 00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.169 huda: it was like a negative number. So. 468 00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.210 Jenny Duan: Negative? What. 469 00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.649 huda: Wasn't this negative? 1, 30,992. 470 00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.150 Jenny Duan: On the tax return. 471 00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.810 huda: Yeah. 472 00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.800 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 473 00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.979 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, negative negative like loss loss. We have to report losses. 474 00:40:40.295 --> 00:40:40.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 475 00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.090 Siraj Nazir: You know I'd be smart. 476 00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.369 Jenny Duan: 9. You can say 0 right now. 477 00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.889 Jenny Duan: but, like I don't think. 478 00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.220 Siraj Nazir: Actually, Huda, the name of the business is Gigsby Hudar. It's not Iv level. 479 00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.040 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. 480 00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.089 Siraj Nazir: You don't even know like how Iv level is written. 481 00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.580 huda: Asking you, Ashley, and you don't. 482 00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.759 Siraj Nazir: You're like. Oh, my God, it's it's. 483 00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.990 Jenny Duan: Okay, and then amount owed. I don't think you owe money on that. 484 00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.520 Siraj Nazir: No, the gigs BGIG, ZBI could not get gigs. B, 485 00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.200 Siraj Nazir: and that's where I met Jenny. Actually. 486 00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:09.950 huda: Wait! Wait! How 487 00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:11.610 huda: is this? Bill? 488 00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.700 Siraj Nazir: GIGZ. B. 489 00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.760 Siraj Nazir: Capital. All capital. Yeah. 490 00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:21.549 Siraj Nazir: I think there was a Gigsby in California, but not in Delaware. So this is the 491 00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.439 Siraj Nazir: the the only license. 492 00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.839 Jenny Duan: Owed I don't know if you owe money on it, so I'd maybe just put 0 for this. 493 00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.510 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 494 00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:30.490 huda: Yeah. 495 00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.019 Jenny Duan: I don't think you have any debt in this. 496 00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.320 Jenny Duan: So yeah, then, yes. 497 00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.049 huda: I think they'll change it a lot. Yeah. 498 00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:41.670 Jenny Duan: I will change it a lot. Yeah, the losses are, yeah, definitely good. Who to? Your 499 00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:44.790 Jenny Duan: not filed. And you don't need to report any income here. 500 00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:55.150 huda: Yeah, and then what was I gonna say? It also said that. The I'm eligible for the fee waiver. So I think that's that's a good sign, I guess. 501 00:41:55.150 --> 00:42:01.529 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a good set, like, I think I think you should get full aid, probably at any of these institutions 502 00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.640 Jenny Duan: so hopefully, that would be good. 503 00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:32.480 Jenny Duan: But yeah, the thing is like, you need to keep on reapplying every single year for this financial aid, which is bad, because, like, even if it gives you fully one year, you need to reapply the next year and the next year and the next year, and they'll redo your aid calculation every year, but at least like, for now you should be fine, but also so this is only one thing, and then, for all the scholarships that we're applying. For once you get your Fafsa, make sure that you get like Pell, grant eligibility, because that will help you for your. 504 00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:42.029 huda: Unc gave me like beta beta access to the Fafsa form. So I think I might fill that out after I submit this as well. 505 00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great 506 00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.450 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think Gates is already 507 00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.330 Jenny Duan: not open. 508 00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.319 Siraj Nazir: So Jenny is a Fafsa expert. When I met her 1st right 509 00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.639 Siraj Nazir: she was like all talking about Fafsa the 1st time I heard about Fafsa at that time. 510 00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:09.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Fafsa doesn't open until December first.st Do you know why they give you early access or beta access? Did they tell you why, or were they like? Did they say. 511 00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:19.580 huda: It's like Unc, I think, is one of the colleges that are like working with Fafsa for like a Beta program. So I don't think it's specific to me, but it was like specific to the college. 512 00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.020 Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. Great sounds good. 513 00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:25.950 Maryam: Let's see. 514 00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:31.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let me think of other than that, like the scholarships that we've 515 00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:35.899 Jenny Duan: we've talked about. I mean, you're applying to all of them. 516 00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.570 Jenny Duan: yeah. 517 00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.619 Jenny Duan: Are you applying to all the major ones? 518 00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:44.640 Jenny Duan: There's just. 519 00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.299 Jenny Duan: oh, one more that I think. 520 00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:50.989 Maryam: You should have 5. 521 00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.870 Jenny Duan: For. 522 00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:04.920 Jenny Duan: Oh, here's 1 another one. I don't think this is on your list. 523 00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:05.870 Maryam: I think. 524 00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.989 Jenny Duan: This one's due in 2 days. I just found it. 525 00:44:10.045 --> 00:44:14.469 Jenny Duan: If you can submit this in 2 days, that would be great. But you also don't need to. 526 00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.160 Jenny Duan: It's not feasible, but I feel like you've. 527 00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.850 huda: I mean, I think I can. But if it requires like a transcript or something, I think that would be. That might be a problem. 528 00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.649 Jenny Duan: Look at the applicant how to apply. 529 00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:50.909 Jenny Duan: the thing is most most of these scholarships like this one, for example, it's not gonna matter for you, because it's only unmet age. So because you're going to be receiving significant financial aid from your college, like 530 00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:57.429 Jenny Duan: most of these scholarships, are not actually going to do anything because they only give you money if like. You're not receiving it from your institution. 531 00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:18.720 Jenny Duan: Unlike unlike some of these other ones like Elks. It's not a last dollar scholarship, so it doesn't. So the money that they give you is separate from the institutions like financially. But this one, for example like, I don't know if this is necessarily worth your time, but you could, if you want to, because they only give it to you. If your school doesn't give it to you. But like, since all the institutions that you're applying to will likely give you the aid anyways 532 00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.189 Jenny Duan: probably won't make a difference. For you. 533 00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.700 Jenny Duan: yeah. 534 00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.749 huda: Okay, it looks like it's asking for 2 academic recommendations. And. 535 00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.730 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, then perhaps not. 536 00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.990 Maryam: Okay. 537 00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.509 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean. 538 00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.699 Jenny Duan: other than that, I feel like. 539 00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.249 Jenny Duan: yeah, I feel like, you're good. 540 00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:45.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 541 00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.799 Jenny Duan: you should be good. 542 00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.649 Jenny Duan: In terms of financial aid. Fafsa opens on December first, st 543 00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.849 Jenny Duan: for Unc. Do you know, when Stanford decisions come out, it's like one month, right? 544 00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:01.700 huda: Yeah December, December. 545 00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.599 Siraj Nazir: 15.th How can you forget her, Jenny. 546 00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah. It's a big day. Fif 15, th right? 547 00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:15.029 huda: Yeah, it's also it's kind of intimidating, because it's like the week before my finals. So. 548 00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:22.779 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's fine, like, if if you get into Stanford great, if you don't get into Stanford, there will be another school like. 549 00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.590 Siraj Nazir: Exactly. Yeah. 550 00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:33.820 Jenny Duan: Like Huda, you'll get into an amazing school like I'm so proud of you. You've worked so hard like your essays are amazing. Your stats look amazing like. I don't think you need to be worried so much, but. 551 00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:34.760 Siraj Nazir: Exactly. 552 00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.689 Jenny Duan: When does Usc come out, do you know, for their early stuff. 553 00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.090 huda: January 20.th 554 00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:41.260 Jenny Duan: That's kind of late for early. 555 00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.170 Jenny Duan: What about you? Let's see you. 556 00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.610 huda: Unc is also in like around. 557 00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.360 huda: I believe it's also around January. 558 00:46:50.027 --> 00:46:52.289 huda: Wait, let me just double check. 559 00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:06.020 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, anyways. And and I think you know, I think you've done your best you. You shouldn't be attached to any of these, you know, it's all gonna happen like you. I mean, you will find a good place where you will really thrive and succeed. 560 00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:12.099 Siraj Nazir: So that's perfectly fine, you know I pushed you as well to get into these, but I think that was just like 561 00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:18.100 Siraj Nazir: only a reason for you to already grow and succeed, and you're already like grown and succeeded, like you know, to 562 00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:24.119 Siraj Nazir: like from starting from a point where you are like. So I still remember, like, you know, those initial 563 00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:30.869 Siraj Nazir: days where you are having these sessions, even with Janice. And you know, Jenny just came fresh and like she started this whole thing. 564 00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.769 Siraj Nazir: It's been amazing, right? Like for you to be like a founder, raise money, run hackathons, you know, that is real real growth. Right? 565 00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:40.920 Siraj Nazir: So 566 00:47:42.023 --> 00:47:44.276 Siraj Nazir: yeah. And I think, 567 00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.120 Siraj Nazir: that is already success in my view. 568 00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.950 Siraj Nazir: you know. 569 00:47:49.950 --> 00:48:05.670 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, sorry. The next step for you is also, like all of these scholarship awards, like, I think that is going to be a big priority this year, especially like, I think Amazon future engineers. I really think you're like the perfect candidate for that. So I really want you to win that one. 570 00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.610 Jenny Duan: yeah. 571 00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:14.407 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. Uda, we all need money. Uda, please get get us more funding, you know, when keep winning these scholarships. 572 00:48:15.465 --> 00:48:15.790 Jenny Duan: And. 573 00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.460 Siraj Nazir: Give it to your parents. That's it. It's very simple. Yeah. 574 00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:24.130 Jenny Duan: Amazon future engineer. Scholarship, I believe. When is the deadline for that? Again? 575 00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:24.500 huda: This. 576 00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.379 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, December 19, th yeah. So that one's huge. 577 00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:32.720 Jenny Duan: I think you're like, really a good candidate for that. 578 00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.810 huda: Like, yeah, I think I'm gonna have 579 00:48:36.077 --> 00:48:41.740 huda: it asked for like a recommendation. And at 1st I wanted to have my English teacher do it. But I think 580 00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:46.960 huda: like seeing as it's a like an engineering one. I think I'll just ask my computer science teacher. 581 00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that would be really good. 582 00:48:49.980 --> 00:49:01.970 Siraj Nazir: And, Jenny, I know that you won so many awards, you know, during senior year, which I still it's hard for me to believe, because you said Oh, from no awards I asked Jenny like, what's your weakness? She said. Oh, from no awards to Stanford, I'm like, you know. Come on. 583 00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.420 Siraj Nazir: but when you told me and I I take you for that like, you know. 584 00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:12.230 Siraj Nazir: so any any specific things that Hoda needs to have in our radar, because, you know, that can always be like 585 00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.889 Siraj Nazir: morale boosting and profile boosting like I saw in secret impact award. 586 00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:18.949 Siraj Nazir: Is that something she can apply to. 587 00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:23.390 Jenny Duan: I think. Nc. Where it's fine. She already got the national award. I don't. It's. 588 00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:26.500 Siraj Nazir: This is an impact award, right? Isn't that like more prestigious. 589 00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:44.080 Jenny Duan: I think, for the purposes of college admissions. What she has is already great for that. I think the next thing would be just like, I really hope that you can get Amazon. Future engineers like that's the one program that I think would be like a really really good fit for you. Obviously, Elks is great. 590 00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:55.069 Jenny Duan: and like the other scholarships that we are, have on our radar like, we have a list of those. So I think, like just making sure that you're sticking to those deadlines and getting those in would be nice. 591 00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.509 Jenny Duan: And then the next deadline is like the University of California essays which are due on November 30, th right. 592 00:50:01.933 --> 00:50:03.189 huda: Yeah, I think. 593 00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.619 huda: actually, I think this year they moved it to December, second or, something like that. 594 00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:18.649 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, yeah. Well, it's like, it's like around that time. And then your regular decisions. And I think because you have fee waivers for colleges like it's pretty advantageous for you to just like. Apply for as many. 595 00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:20.049 huda: Yeah, I, actually decided, 596 00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.720 Jenny Duan: Coolest as you can. 597 00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:33.868 huda: Yeah, I decided, a bunch of random colleges like Barnard and like, I wasn't gonna apply to Cornell. But I feel like I feel like I should just apply to the ivy's just just cause. But. 598 00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:39.239 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I like, you have fee waivers. So you're not paying like $90 per application. 599 00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:43.990 Jenny Duan: So I mean, I think, common app? Does it? Common app, cap you at 30? 600 00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:44.990 Jenny Duan: Alright! 601 00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.850 huda: Think, so, yeah. 602 00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:49.740 Jenny Duan: 30, but 30 is like, I don't think you need to apply to more than 30 schools. 603 00:50:49.890 --> 00:51:12.370 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I'd like, say, apply to all the Ivs apply to any school that you feel like you are remotely interested in going to. But I think if you're not interested in going to a school don't apply for it, even if it's a prestigious school, because, like you should only apply to schools that you want to go to, regardless of their prestige. So if there's a school that you think is prestigious, but you wouldn't want to go to. There's I don't think it's there's a point in applying for it. 604 00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:26.189 Siraj Nazir: So Jen, I mean, let's focus on the the Iv plus, like, you know, Iv schools, right? Iv is like, you know, what? What would you? What? What is the target? And like, you know, who does target list right now? I mean, of course, you know, Stan, I mean, these are like reach right. 605 00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:34.659 Jenny Duan: I think, like Barnard would be like a target like an example of a target school. Barnard would be like, really good. I think Huda can get into like 606 00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:44.960 Jenny Duan: Georgia tech, like schools like, I think those are like pretty target like schools like they're competitive hard to get into like Cornell. I feel like you have a really good chance that getting into 607 00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:53.130 Jenny Duan: like anything I think in like the I think you'll definitely get into like the twenties. For sure, but like 608 00:51:53.250 --> 00:52:01.579 Jenny Duan: I think Berkeley like, I think you would be a good fit for, like Santa Cruz like Usc. I think, like all these schools, you would be a really good fit, for it's just like. 609 00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:17.779 Jenny Duan: like, I think you're at that. You're at like threshold. It's just like it's a matter of fit like if it's not like, are you not qualified because you're qualified? I don't think that's the problem. It's like, Are you a good fit for this institution? Or do they think, do they think that they are a good fit for you? I think that's the only thing. 610 00:52:18.529 --> 00:52:19.139 Jenny Duan: So. 611 00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:41.450 Siraj Nazir: Let's be honest, right, you know, when you go to like, you know, top like, you know. Hypsm, I mean, there's always going to be more competition. They're like very strong profiles. But again, the good thing is like the diversity, like, you know, that identity and narrative. Now that I'm looking at so many applications. Impressive like, you know, there are so many admits. Actually, it's hard to believe that they got in, you know, because they didn't really have, but they had something very unique. And I think 612 00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:50.360 Siraj Nazir: that is the of course, you know, there are, of course, like 30%, very highly. Quant kind of, you know, a big brains, you know, that. Get in 613 00:52:50.653 --> 00:53:00.909 Siraj Nazir: but like Jenny as an example like she didn't have like a very big spike in anything, but she was like Jack of all trades, and I think that's what Huda is very similar profile. So hopefully, you know. 614 00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:25.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think you'll be. I think you'll do good. I mean, like it just also depends on like some things that you don't know, like the strength of your recommendations, like those, will probably be good. But, like you don't know about that, like, there's just like some factors outside of your control per se. But like, I think you'll definitely go to a good school like, I don't think you need to be worried about going to a good school. It's just like, which of these good schools is it gonna be? 615 00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:33.479 Jenny Duan: But like, yeah, I think like Barnard would be a good fit like you should also apply to Columbia, like, you know, stuff like that, I think 616 00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:37.010 Jenny Duan: mit like, I think all these schools. 617 00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:46.039 huda: I think the thing with Mit is it has like a separate application, and I'm applying there anyway. But like cause I I remember, though. 618 00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.259 Jenny Duan: They have their own portal. Yeah. 619 00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:53.460 huda: That was like the 1st program I think you showed, which was like the comparative media that one. 620 00:53:53.825 --> 00:53:56.750 Siraj Nazir: Has become amazing. I mean they I mean. 621 00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:03.759 Siraj Nazir: I showed Jenny. I took some snapshots. I I could not even recognize if it was like mit cool. 622 00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.600 Jenny Duan: Amazing. Yeah, it's great. 623 00:54:07.337 --> 00:54:20.360 Jenny Duan: I think you'd be a good fit for like, I know, like I, I know, like I have so much conviction that, like you're gonna be somewhere great. It's just like, I don't want you to get your emotions attached to any one specific school, because, like 624 00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:25.829 Jenny Duan: you never really like. I don't know. I don't think you never, ever really know, but I think like. 625 00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:26.610 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 626 00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.810 Jenny Duan: No, you'll go somewhere. 627 00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:33.910 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean, what is that statistic? I mean, you can say, I mean, that's fine. We you know, we can talk about guns now. 628 00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.639 Siraj Nazir: Oh, Hi! 629 00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:41.390 Jenny Duan: Gonna say, like, you're more likely to get shot or to survive a bullet to the head than to like get into Stanford. 630 00:54:42.026 --> 00:54:42.640 huda: Like this. 631 00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.350 Jenny Duan: Terms of probability. But, like. 632 00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.040 Jenny Duan: I don't know, I think you'll be fine 633 00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:51.399 Jenny Duan: like the like if you think about it. Like, if you apply 634 00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:52.870 Jenny Duan: to like. 635 00:54:52.910 --> 00:55:05.060 Jenny Duan: okay, the chance of getting into one top school is like what? 5% sure. But then, if you apply to like funny schools and every school, you have a chance. 5% chance. Then, like the chance you get into, one of them is higher. Right? So 636 00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.410 Jenny Duan: so it's okay, yeah. 637 00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.430 huda: That's comforting. 638 00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:17.729 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And like also, like, you'll totally just be fine like, who know you're smart. You know that you worked hard like you have such an impressive profile like you'll be fine. 639 00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 640 00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.916 huda: Thank you. 641 00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:28.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but just just like the waiting game is always so hard, because you never know like it's kind of outside of your fate like you do what you can. And then you just like. 642 00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.190 Jenny Duan: have to be like, okay. But like. 643 00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:37.150 huda: Nervous that right now there's there could be someone like that's reading my Stanford application and like 644 00:55:37.507 --> 00:55:40.290 huda: like me up, or something. I don't know. 645 00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:41.050 Jenny Duan: I mean. 646 00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.240 Jenny Duan: you'll totally be fine 647 00:55:44.260 --> 00:56:03.450 Jenny Duan: also, like, just don't even sweat, because, like, think about how how competitive J. Camp was, for example, and like you got into that. Think about Nc wit like how competitive that is. Like you already got that like you have all these signals like, like I said, summer programs are like a good way to guess your application, your admissions for other things 648 00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:18.759 Jenny Duan: right? Especially with these competitive summer programs, so like the fact that you already gone to like a really really competitive summer program means that, like, you're competing against the same like, these are the same people that are applying to the colleges that you want to go to. Right? So the fact that you already gone to a top summer program means that, like. 649 00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:24.449 Jenny Duan: you're already doing better than like most of your peers, I would say, Yeah. 650 00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:31.620 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. And you know, I think, see, there's no harm in applying. I mean, I was just telling her about what us presidential scholar 651 00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:37.599 Siraj Nazir: right? I mean, I was going through all the profiles I saw, like a lot of students and coaches have it like, you know, Jenny wanted as well. 652 00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:55.170 Siraj Nazir: I mean again, like I I mean, of course, might be. There are certain base like prerequisites, and if she doesn't mean that's a different story. But if not, then why not? And immediately, like Huda, said, like, Oh, no way like, Come on. I'm from California, like, do you think I said like, yeah. But you got nct right in no cal like you want, so I think 653 00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:05.850 Jenny Duan: Also, it helps that you're from like you're from, not like a super densely like populated region. And like you're from like a more rural area that like definitely helps you even in California. 654 00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.790 Siraj Nazir: Absolutely, Jenny, now that I've been like living and breathing and building this features. Oh, my God! 655 00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:29.720 Siraj Nazir: And you know what like I've been like literally like reviewing these applications. And it's so interesting on how these things make such a huge difference. And I mean kudos to you. Actually, you know, when Jenny came on board like that was the time. And they even discussed like, Hey, your Muslim identity, you know. That's actually a very significant factor. 656 00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.960 Siraj Nazir: And you know, we never even thought about it as a as in. 657 00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.409 Siraj Nazir: And then that can always be a case right? Like people want. 658 00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:43.010 Siraj Nazir: despite all the drama that's happening around. People still want to have like that kind of diverse class, you know. 659 00:57:43.010 --> 00:58:05.600 Jenny Duan: I mean, like, while Stanford invests in so many resources, like every school, like invest in so many resources like Stanford, has, like a Muslim community center like they have staff there, like like fully full time staff, like incubating this community. So like, obviously, they want students with these backgrounds there, and like having intellectual diversity, diversity of culture, diversity in all forms like super important to all of these top schools. So 660 00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.170 Jenny Duan: anything that makes you different is is a strength. Yeah. 661 00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:21.169 Siraj Nazir: And, Jenny, do you know, I don't know if that told you that I did this fun exercise right? And and of course it was. I don't know how much I I don't think it's bias. It was really like a completely different new instance of 662 00:58:21.547 --> 00:58:28.099 Siraj Nazir: what we did was like, you know, we have this like 500 applications now stored right? And what we did was 663 00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:37.260 Siraj Nazir: what I did was as a dad, right. I just took her blind profile, like her entire application, with extracurricular narrative when she had done it like before submitting to Stanford 664 00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:39.979 Siraj Nazir: and So 665 00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:46.489 Siraj Nazir: I ran it with multiple different, like very, very similar kind of profiles. You know, top profiles and stuff like that. 666 00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:48.449 Siraj Nazir: It is very interesting 667 00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:56.020 Siraj Nazir: that how like, you know? The the AI every single time, you know, it would come and pick Huda's profile actually. 668 00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:02.340 Siraj Nazir: And and I think the reasoning right again. A very, very interesting reasoning was always the interdisciplinary aspect 669 00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:04.939 Siraj Nazir: that it always said, like, you know. Yes. 670 00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:19.809 Jenny Duan: Now with AI like software engineering, like all those jobs like any job. That is just one specific task is going to be gone like. That's Huda strength. She does many things like it's, it's very valuable, not only for college, but just like for your career. It's very good. Yeah. 671 00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:34.709 Siraj Nazir: And you know, it would basically say, because you know, the whole idea was that it was an admission officer, right? A committee. And then it would basically evaluate every plus and minus. And the the main reason to pick keep picking, like, you know, with multiple different applications, would always be like. Oh. 672 00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:51.399 Siraj Nazir: this profile will be able to add the most impact right and benefit to the Stanford campus. And this is the kind of profile that Stanford expects. It's very interesting, because I always thought about Spike. Right? I think when I look at Howard profile, it's all spike, Spike, Spike, Spike, Mike. It's a very Stanford thingy, I guess right. 673 00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:56.509 Jenny Duan: Definitely. Stanford. Every school like has their own predisposition because they want to 674 00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:23.729 Jenny Duan: like have a certain student body. So like Harvard, typically, for example, like accepts people who have, like a very big spike in one area, who are like going to be like, I mean Harvard alums. They go, and they maybe are like public figures. They're like diplomats. They're like those statesmen like that's like kind of what Harvard looks for, like. People who are very impressive in one area. But like Stanford people, they're way different. Like, I think Stanford students are more socially minded like they care about having impact like 675 01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:41.409 Jenny Duan: they're more interdisciplinary mit students are like more nerdy, you know, like more stem. They have like a more specific focus. I don't know. Princeton's also very academic, like lots of Princeton students go. Do. Phds, like every school, has its own vibe, so they always want to curate students who are like similar to their student body. 676 01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.299 Siraj Nazir: Awesome. I know your top of the hour so nice to see you, Jenny. It's been a while we need to connect, but 677 01:00:47.560 --> 01:01:02.909 Siraj Nazir: I've also been like. I think the timing was not great, but it's good with us. So you're confident with the Css. Profile. Now I think it's appeal and all that stuff. So I think that process you should need to. You need to learn. Probably watch for Jenny's videos. I guess you know you do have a channel right on Fafsa and other things. 678 01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:12.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, I haven't posted in a while, but I do have one video on it. But I think, yeah, Huda, you'll be totally fine, I think now it's just like the waiting game, and just like 679 01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.059 Jenny Duan: seeing your hard work pay off and like just 680 01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:19.789 Jenny Duan: could work on those scholarship applications a lot cause. Those are important. So. 681 01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:22.590 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. So what are the places where Huda needs to? 682 01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:33.209 Siraj Nazir: you know. Accelerate a bit because she's a bit quite complacent these days, you know, I can see that, you know she's a she's like stress free. And and then I look at other students who are like working day and night. You know. 683 01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:33.900 Jenny Duan: Gosh! 684 01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:45.020 Jenny Duan: Not to say. But my other student, as you know, is, is really having a tough time right now. But who doesn't ahead? Who does. You're doing great, I'd say, if you, if you have more time, just like 685 01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:53.650 Jenny Duan: work on keeping your grades up for those 1st semester grades, your second semester grades don't matter. But your 1st semester grades they do matter a lot 686 01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.010 Jenny Duan: scholarship applications, and then. 687 01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.520 Jenny Duan: yeah, free time, just like, enjoy your life. I don't know. You're. 688 01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.750 Siraj Nazir: No, I think that's that's taboo. Now. I think that's after like her final application right. 689 01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:11.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, yeah. Well, get all your regular decision essays in. If you're applying to like 30 schools, you have a lot of essays to write. So 690 01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:17.760 Jenny Duan: yeah, but like scholarships, it's like a good thing to do right now. 691 01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:24.549 Siraj Nazir: I think. Thanks a lot. And since Mariam is also on the call, I mean, you know, really like, I think it's been an amazing, fabulous journey 692 01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.350 Siraj Nazir: for Huda, you know, and it's. 693 01:02:26.350 --> 01:02:28.500 Jenny Duan: Fingers crossed. We're not done yet. We're not done. 694 01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.419 Siraj Nazir: You've seen it right, Jenny. You have seen her grow like, you know, from 695 01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:37.930 Siraj Nazir: being that shy girl you know, talking about. Oh, I don't have a seat in a stem club, all boys, and crying and all that stuff. 696 01:02:38.812 --> 01:02:45.100 Siraj Nazir: You know. And now she's like I I say, that she's become a gangster now, like she is a gangster at times, you know. 697 01:02:45.904 --> 01:02:50.389 Siraj Nazir: The same boys are actually, you know, stalking her profile. You know that. 698 01:02:50.915 --> 01:02:59.440 Siraj Nazir: Because I shared that with you like you know people like oh, what what has she done? Or oh, like Hackathon, you know. And and then, in fact, copying and replicating. 699 01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.460 Siraj Nazir: No. 700 01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.080 Siraj Nazir: But yeah. 701 01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:08.880 Siraj Nazir: I mean, it's such a fun experience. Actually, you know, this whole college prep is really transforms kids. And 702 01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:10.260 Siraj Nazir: you know. 703 01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.520 Siraj Nazir: music 704 01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:15.912 Siraj Nazir: cool. Yeah, Jenny, good luck.

How's life. 4 00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:44.859 huda: Yeah, I think it's it's been going great. I mean, like schools definitely intensifying because, we're like in our second quarter. So it's like, kind of 5 00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.509 huda: getting closer to finals. So it's getting a little tough in like this end. So been a bit occupied in that. But yeah, other than that. Not not much going on. 6 00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.460 Jenny Duan: Gotcha were you? Has the Elks Mvs. Has that already passed, or not?

Okay. 10 00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.879 Jenny Duan: Today, let's talk about your Css profile, because to my understanding, that's due on November 15, th right? 11 00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.480 huda: Yeah. 12 00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.310 Jenny Duan: Do you have it open? And would you be able to share your screen so we can walk through that. 13 00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.310 huda: Yes. 14 00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:32.950 huda: I put in like I try to put in as many colleges as I can, but for some it wasn't letting me add any more. So. 15 00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.120 huda: But yeah. 16 00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.860 Jenny Duan: That's okay. 17 00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.330 Jenny Duan: And for you to send it, it's free, right? 18 00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:42.630 Jenny Duan: Actually, is it always free? Or do you get a fee waiver? I don't know. 19 00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.560 huda: I think it's a fee waiver thing. 20 00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.940 J",
    "enny Duan: Cool. 21 00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.209 Jenny Duan: So I think the key here is to they ask you for, like your parents, income and assets. Right? So report that, like 22 00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.539 Jenny Duan: the do they ask you for previous tax statements, or do they ask you for this year's. 23 00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.889 huda: For previous and this year's. 24 00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.190 Jenny Duan: Okay. 25 00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.360 Jenny Duan: So 26 00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.069 Jenny Duan: I think, like, with your current financial circumstances like you should be eligible, for. 27 00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.309 Jenny Duan: like full financial aid at every single university, like at least like at the big ones. The offer 28 00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.481 Jenny Duan: so like that should be like what you're aiming for. 29 00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.178 Jenny Duan: what year did they ask for the financial statements like, how many years ago do they ask for like 2 years, one year. 30 00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:36.859 huda: They asked for the 2023 tax return form. And I think that's actually kind of working against me because actually, like my dad had like a lot of money from like like 31 00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:47.919 huda: kind of reimbursement or not reimbursement, but like like his old employment, like had paid him. But yeah, I think it's like not really working in our favor. But. 32 00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.079 Jenny Duan: I see, was your mom also working in 2023 as well? Or was she not. 33 00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.512 huda: Yes, yeah. She was. 34 00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.195 Jenny Duan: Okay, 35 00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.329 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine. 36 00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.849 Jenny Duan: like you like, you have to report just what it says, but 37 00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.790 Jenny Duan: does ask you about like 38 00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.349 Jenny Duan: it does ask you about this year's right that you can stop sharing right now if it",
    "'s like telling the information like, I don't need to see like the exact numbers, but, like 39 00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.870 Jenny Duan: for this year's. Do they ask, do they ask you? They ask you about this year's too right. 40 00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:24.310 huda: Well, they can't like, I think they 41 00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.609 huda: they asked like roughly, like, how much like are your parents making? And so I gave like A rough estimate, I said. Like. 42 00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.700 huda: like, actually, I'm not even sure. 43 00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.310 Jenny Duan: Go like, like, go like, low, yeah, what? 44 00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:40.779 huda: Yes, I said, like 60,000 45 00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:52.129 huda: and then it also asked for like my dad's like stocks. And so I said, like like. I don't know how low it's like I should be like putting, because. 46 00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:54.670 Jenny Duan: You can say like 0. I feel like 47 00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.480 Jenny Duan: you can say 0. 48 00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.690 huda: Cause. There's like. 49 00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.340 huda: I think, like it says in like what counts as income, and it. 50 00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.870 Jenny Duan: So. 51 00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.240 huda: Business and stuff. 52 00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.120 huda: so I'm not sure. Let me open up. 53 00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:23.300 Jenny Duan: You should check with your dad about this, because it's not only like profit, but it's also like, because I know, for like this, like investing in a startup like he's also investing in it. Right? So he's like spending money to like build the business because he's not raising money for it so like that. Also, like you need to subtract that right from everything 54 00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.709 Jenny Duan: so like, I think you should talk to him about that, and like try to report it like 55 00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.815 Jenny Duan: Lower. 56 00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.050 huda: Yeah. 57 00:04:31.050 --> 0",
    "0:04:33.839 Jenny Duan: Like as accurately as you can. 58 00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:47.179 Jenny Duan: That way you can maximize your financial aid. And then also, one thing is like, even if your tax returns are like from previous years that show higher numbers. After you get into like, for example, Stanford, you can say that you can file like 59 00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:59.449 Jenny Duan: an edit for for more financially, you can like that, file an appeal. And then in your appeal, you can like you get the chance to actually explain your situation, because I don't know if they give you the option to like. Write anything about your situation on this. 60 00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.370 huda: You told me. 61 00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:17.840 Jenny Duan: Oh, they do. Okay. So you can write like, then I would write like, you know, both your parents are not working like I would definitely write about that. And then, if Stanford doesn't, or if whatever school you know doesn't end up giving you like adequate financially, you can submit an appeal, and they usually will like give you more. 62 00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.419 Jenny Duan: because I think, as they justified in your circumstances. 63 00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:25.796 huda: And then I think they're also had like one about 64 00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.829 huda: they had 65 00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.909 huda: one about like the businesses. And then we have, we technically have like 2 66 00:05:33.297 --> 00:05:47.899 huda: and so for for my dad's business, I put that we're running on like, it's like he told me that it's like loss, it's running at a loss. So I think that might work in my favor. Let me see. 67 00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.640 Jenny Duan: Yeah, report that like 68 00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.750 Jenny Duan: definitely. 69 00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.759 huda: yeah, and let me show you what I put for my special circumstances. Thing. 70 00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.180 Jenny Duan: Alright, cool. 71 00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:07.790 huda",
    ": So I said, chain of employment. 72 00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.880 huda: and then I kind of use the same like additional information. 73 00:06:14.622 --> 00:06:18.680 huda: Part. But I think I have space to like elaborate more, maybe, but. 74 00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.605 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 75 00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.439 Jenny Duan: maybe you should write that like your tax statements from 2023 don't actually reflect like 76 00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.230 Jenny Duan: your family's current financial circumstances. 77 00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.330 huda: Yeah. 78 00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so just like, make sure that that's really clear. 79 00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:47.179 Jenny Duan: Cause I like, I really think you should be eligible. For, like full financial aid from at least like Stanford would give you that 80 00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.770 Jenny Duan: and like all the private schools that you're applying to, would 81 00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.720 Jenny Duan: So 82 00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.760 Jenny Duan: you can say, like our financial situation has changed drastically from like 83 00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:14.559 Jenny Duan: the 2023 tax reports or something like that, to just specify that it's that situation with your current. 84 00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.480 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 85 00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.250 huda: I think I'll put that here. 86 00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. 87 00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.590 huda: Okay, does this look like? 88 00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.150 huda: Hmm. 89 00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.700 Jenny Duan: Maybe say our friend situation has changed drastically. 90 00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.199 Jenny Duan: and then I don't think you need to write that it's like inspired you to create. 91 00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.930 Jenny Duan: I don't think you should do that cause that like that's relevant for your additional information section. But it's not relevant for this, because, like. 92 00:08:10.600 --> 00:",
    "08:14.090 Jenny Duan: yeah, I don't care about that. It's a financial aid thing. Yeah. 93 00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.900 Jenny Duan: yeah.

So just make sure that you take that into account 129 00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.620 Jenny Duan: when it comes to family. 130 00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 131 00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:31.730 huda: Correct. 132 00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.350 Jenny Duan: Do you want to ask your dad to get on this call, or you can check with him later, too, and submit it. 133 00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.283 huda: Yeah, I think he's a he's a bit 134 00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.089 huda: busy. Actually. Let me send the join link to him again. 135 00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.300 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. If he's busy. That's fine. I think. 136 00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.200 Jenny Duan: like, I think, regardless of what happens. 137 00:11:51.400 --> 00:12:00.280 Jenny Duan: you will probably might. You probably might have to submit an appeal just because your tax records like they're from, they ask for between 23 tax records. And so 138 00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:15.419 Jenny Duan: I think, like, if they go off of that. Then you're just gonna have to submit, appeal and appeal regardless and like, they're usually pretty generous with appeals like this year. I submitted a financial appeal. And I got like an extra 10,000 from Stanford because of that. So like. 139 00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:24.680 Jenny Duan: And then in your situation, it'd be like even more, because obviously your parents aren't working. So I think maybe just expect to submit an appeal like, regardless of. 140 00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:35.549 Jenny Duan: What happens here. But I think, for here, like obviously to the Mo. To your knowledge, like reporting the like, a lower amount is always going to be more advantageous for you. 141 00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:36.860 huda: But 142 00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:43.450 huda: okay, yeah, that that sounds great. I think. Then I'll just go over it again, with with my da",
    "d, yeah. 143 00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.810 Jenny Duan: And as long as it's like accurate, it's fine, like. 144 00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:52.010 Jenny Duan: I think there's not too much you can really do with financial aid. Besides, at this point. Besides, like 145 00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.600 Jenny Duan: I mean, like 146 00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.179 Jenny Duan: what people do for financial aid is like 147 00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.030 Jenny Duan: if you oh, here he is! 148 00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.069 Jenny Duan: Hi! Siraj! 149 00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.911 Siraj Nazir: Hi! How are you? Sorry? I mean, let me also give 150 00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.400 Siraj Nazir: the link to 151 00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.720 Siraj Nazir: oh. 152 00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.839 Siraj Nazir: you know. Maria, actually my wife's also joining. How are you doing? 153 00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.379 Jenny Duan: I'm good. Yeah. 154 00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.560 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean a bit intense. I was actually involved with you know, Arnav Arnav's dad actually. 155 00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.470 Jenny Duan: Oh, gosh! What happened? 156 00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:31.440 Siraj Nazir: No, I mean, I don't like, you know, he I don't know if you know right, but you see, like he's been playing his own playbook, and then I think he's fixated 157 00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:37.639 Siraj Nazir: with debate. You know it's such a low return of investment. But I mean parents to be blamed to be very honest. 158 00:13:38.215 --> 00:13:43.589 Siraj Nazir: But yeah, I mean, you know, the thing was like he was literally like, in in the whole one year 159 00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.930 Siraj Nazir: he just took like 9 sessions. Can you imagine. 160 00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.170 Jenny Duan: No, what can you really do in 9 sessions? You can't. 161 00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.840 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, nothing 162 00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.870 Siraj Nazir: right? And then. 163 00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.180 Jenny Duan: Change,",
    " no possible change in 9 sessions. 164 00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.710 Siraj Nazir: That's you. 165 00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.910 Jenny Duan: Over one year. 166 00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:03.050 Siraj Nazir: Okay, Mariam, join. Actually, she wait a minute. Yeah, you did. Oh, she did. Okay. 167 00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.489 Jenny Duan: It is. Yeah. 168 00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.290 Siraj Nazir: I live. 169 00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.899 Jenny Duan: Hello! We! Who didn't I just finish talking about? Hello! Nice to meet you. 170 00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:13.215 huda: You're muted. 171 00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.499 Siraj Nazir: You're muted. Varia. Yeah. So 172 00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:36.460 Siraj Nazir: yeah, I mean, actually, you know, we we were all like collecting all the profiles today, Jenny. You know different images, etc. Right? So I was also looking. And actually, I somehow ended up in your like, 3 year old photo, or like 4 year old picture. 173 00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.869 Siraj Nazir: I think it's in the fencing, I think. Probably fencing website. 174 00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.430 Jenny Duan: Oh, wow! Wait! 175 00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.640 Siraj Nazir: It was so funny. 176 00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:53.150 Siraj Nazir: And you just looked like Huda. Actually, you know, Huda was also, like, you know, I I remember Huda. I didn't share it with anyone, you know, but I think Huda can figure it out. 177 00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.590 Jenny Duan: Boards. Okay, let me. I'll look for I don't have that many 178 00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.630 Jenny Duan: chorus. 179 00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.019 Jenny Duan: Actually, I just got an award. So maybe I'll put that photo. 180 00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.940 Jenny Duan: But yeah, who did I just finish talking about her css, profile? 181 00:15:14.272 --> 00:15:39.689 Jenny Duan: I think, regardless of what happens, she'll probably have to submit an appeal for financial aid. I think that Huda should be eligible for full financial aid, like a fu",
    "ll ride at pretty much any private college she goes to. But I think she'll probably have to submit an appeal, because all the tax forms that they asked for are 2023, and so to submit. Like her most recent financial statements like she'll probably have to make an appeal after she gets into the institution. 182 00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.829 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think we we really needed a kind of a 1 on one, too, you know, like. 183 00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.129 Siraj Nazir: you know, because I think there's just so many forms. 184 00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.150 Siraj Nazir: And 185 00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.020 Siraj Nazir: yeah, let me. 186 00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.239 Siraj Nazir: I mean, so Mariam is joining mommy's joining or work. 187 00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.990 huda: I think her audio wasn't working. 188 00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.890 Siraj Nazir: Her is not working, and she has a new laptop. 189 00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:07.493 Siraj Nazir: Might be, you know. I don't. Yeah, I mean, she goes on, calls as well. Right? So, okay, so, 190 00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.249 Siraj Nazir: yeah, Jenny, I think 191 00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:15.250 Siraj Nazir: you know, might be just like taking a step back, you know, kind of just give us like an overview on 192 00:16:15.734 --> 00:16:21.615 Siraj Nazir: you know, at least from my understanding as well, because there's so so many terms and technical difficulties. Right? So 193 00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:33.649 Siraj Nazir: I think one of the key challenges is that and I don't know what classifications of financial need need based, not need based. I mean, that's also confusing, but might be very simple, because you have spent a lot of time there. 194 00:16:34.096 --> 00:16:36.450 Siraj Nazir: The key question I have is this. 195 00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:40.739 Siraj Nazir: the challenge that we have is, like, you know. 196 00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.229 Siraj Nazir: 2,000. 197 00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:51.978 Siraj Nazir: there is Fafsa, a",
    "nd there is the Css profile as well. Hopefully Fafsa exists under under the new administration. But 198 00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.492 Siraj Nazir: The thing is, 199 00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.740 Siraj Nazir: 2,000. 200 00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.439 Siraj Nazir: The tax returns of 2,003 201 00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.299 Siraj Nazir: which is like, you know. Like, I mean. So also this year is 2,000. Yeah, this is 2024. 202 00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:12.620 Siraj Nazir: So last year, 2023, we would have filed for 20. Yeah. 20. Sorry. 203 00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.369 Siraj Nazir: How does it work? Again? 204 00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:21.409 Siraj Nazir: 2023 we would have filed for like 2020 like. Which tax return did I give you. 205 00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:21.979 huda: You gave me the. 206 00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.570 Jenny Duan: 23. 207 00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:23.539 huda: 23. 208 00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:33.996 Siraj Nazir: 23, right? So see? Like. So, Jenny, on 23, right? Like, you know, the income is quite high. Right? So because that's the year that I you know. 209 00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.350 Siraj Nazir: that's the year I left, like, you know, Google. And 210 00:17:37.798 --> 00:17:42.600 Siraj Nazir: of course, I mean it, even though it was a layoff, like, you know, we got like a lump sum kind of. 211 00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.390 Siraj Nazir: So it's a it's a huge. Unfortunately, it doesn't help with our right, because 212 00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:55.529 Siraj Nazir: it was it was. It was quite, you know, for it was a good package, right? So I think. Unfortunately, we won't be able to show anything with 2023, 213 00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.900 Siraj Nazir: 2024. I have done my best 214 00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:16.560 Siraj Nazir: to keep it like below, like, you know, 60 grand or something like that, and I know there are a lot of loopholes and stuff like that as a business right might be. There's a lot of benefits, and I've worked with my attorney as well. I mean. All I ca",
    "n show is, like, you know, completely lost making business. We can move around money and all that stuff we can do things like, you know, like to avail the loophole? 215 00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:27.030 Siraj Nazir: so you know, just like, you know, let us know. Like, How do? What should we do? Because it, you know. Clearly she doesn't qualify for Fafsa right? Based on the 2023 earnings. 216 00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:56.329 Jenny Duan: so okay, the difference. So that there's 2 documents that who don't need to submit 1st is the Fafsa which is for federal aid. This will confirm her eligibility, for, like pell grants and government aid, so filling out the Fafsa will be really good if you can confirm your pell, grant eligibility, Pell Grant. Eligibility is important because it unlocks like different programs, like in scholarships. Later on, for example, like the Gates Foundation scholarship, I think, is only for students who receive pell grants 217 00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:20.080 Jenny Duan: or who are Pell grant eligible. So that's 1 piece. The Css. Profile is what every school uses to calculate, like the financial aid package offered by the school. So what Stanford uses is a combination of the Fafsa and the Css. Profile. The Css. Profile asks more questions than the Fafsa does. So it's a little bit more specific now in the Css. Profile there's a section to explain, like your current circumstances as well as what you 218 00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:43.009 Jenny Duan: what your current family income is. So I think Huda is using that to her advantage to explain that both parents are not working right now that her financial situation has changed drastically from 2023. So what I think will happen is the school that she gets into. So let's just use Stanford as an example, but, like any top private school that has, like competitive financial aid, will probably offer her an initial package. 219 00:19:43.326 --> 00:20:10.849 Jenny Duan: That may or may not be comprehensive now, I think Hud",
    "a should be eligible for full financial aid. I think, from most of these private institutions that she's applying for, but what that will entail is after she gets in. She'll likely need to file an appeal to the school financial Aid office to explain that like this was the situation on my Css. Profile. But here is what my family is experiencing right now, and after filing that appeal they will probably make a new aid. 220 00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:19.149 Siraj Nazir: Okay, okay, yeah. So so I think, whatever goes in the current css, profile right now is only for the 2023. Unfortunately, right? 221 00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.699 Jenny Duan: But there was an option for you to write in what 222 00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.840 Jenny Duan: your parents are currently making right. 223 00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:33.990 huda: Yeah, there's actually a section on the Css which asks you to kind of like estimate how much the 2024 income is and. 224 00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.379 Siraj Nazir: Wanna display to the, I think let's go through the form right? Because 225 00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.986 Siraj Nazir: might be 226 00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.709 Siraj Nazir: I mean, especially the areas where it's about the current, the what we are currently making right. 227 00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.030 huda: And. 228 00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:57.029 Siraj Nazir: Also, like, you know, Jenny, these assets and stuff like that. See? The thing is like, I really want to use any loophole. We want to be ethical, and we want to be very accurate, but I think at the same time, you know, if there are things that we don't have to report. We don't have to report, you know. 229 00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:07.839 Siraj Nazir: because think about stocks. Now, right like, you know, people can have stocks. People can have money. People can have like liquid assets, you know. I I don't know, like I don't know how much of this is really going to be verified. 230 00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:10.930 Siraj Nazir: So I think I, we need so",
    "me guidance there 231 00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:11.825 Siraj Nazir: because 232 00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.980 Siraj Nazir: and and also like, you know, I'm sure that at the end of the day any form is really. 233 00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.940 Siraj Nazir: you know, their whole goal with the form is to find ways by which they can actually eliminate someone, you know. 234 00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:34.359 Siraj Nazir: So you know. So so like, you know. Put on your like Fafsa and Css hat, and and tell us, because I know that you know people actually avail a lot of loopholes here. And why not? You know. 235 00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:48.279 Jenny Duan: The best loophole is, I believe they don't ask you about the value of your current home, so if you have any mortgages on your home, or if you have anything, any like debt on your home at all, I would try to pay that off, and because I don't think 236 00:21:48.280 --> 00:22:13.750 Jenny Duan: they count the value of the home that you're living in as an asset like, for example, if you have money in the bank, they're going to count that. But if you have a value on your current property, so not any additional properties, but like the house that you live in now, I don't think they count that. So that would be something like, if you have any debt or any like leverage on your home like, try to put your assets into that, because that doesn't count your Fafsa. 237 00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.860 huda: So first.st 238 00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:19.590 Siraj Nazir: What kind of asset? Sorry like, what kind of asset are you using. 239 00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:28.819 Jenny Duan: They look for your stock portfolio, your like savings, accounts, and basically anything that you report on your taxes is going to be asked for on this. 240 00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.819 Siraj Nazir: So so so see? I, okay. So now there are 2 things here, right? And that's what I said. Now, the thing with 241 00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:41.179 Siraj Nazir: So the only thing that's verif",
    "iable at this point an official document is actually your 242 00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:48.489 Siraj Nazir: the what is that tax return? I mean, I'm like, it's the what's that? 1 0 9 9 w. 2 w, 2, like tax 243 00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.890 Siraj Nazir: return form. Right? Whatever I shared with you. Rightula. 244 00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.130 Siraj Nazir: yeah. 245 00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.340 Siraj Nazir: So. 246 00:22:54.340 --> 00:23:04.090 huda: One. Also, I wanted to add that in this Dss profile it actually asked for like the current homes value and like how much we've paid so far. 247 00:23:04.412 --> 00:23:08.370 huda: I think it might be different from the Fafsa in that way. But yeah. 248 00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.070 Jenny Duan: Oh, they do ask for that. Okay, I see. I don't think. 249 00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:24.450 Siraj Nazir: This is all not act like, you know, this is the point, right? We have been like, you know, just like pick one number kind of a thing, because at the end of the day, like, of course, it's not this amount. It's it's more. But I mean, I can always like, you know, as a business, we can always show that 250 00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.820 Siraj Nazir: it's the balance that eventually I you know, it's all reinvested, or probably I can pick. 251 00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.799 Jenny Duan: I think the income can be 252 00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:39.570 Jenny Duan: 0 like, I honestly don't think that you can. You need to report that because I think because you're still investing in this business, like 253 00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.529 Jenny Duan: income is like 254 00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.439 Jenny Duan: profits minus losses. Right? So if you're like costs are higher than like. 255 00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.119 Jenny Duan: it's okay. I think you don't need to report that. 256 00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.929 Siraj Nazir: And that's like. 257 00:23:48.930 --> 00:24:01.159 Jenny Duan: You're you're you're self employed. You don't have a tax you don't like.",
    " I don't know you're not being. You're not receiving like w nines every month, or W fours or anything. So it's I don't think you need to report that actually. 258 00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.760 Siraj Nazir: Okay, that's great. Actually, let's see, these were the things that 259 00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.869 Siraj Nazir: I was freaking out as well. Because, see, I don't want to provide any information where 260 00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:26.599 Siraj Nazir: they verify, and they come to know. And and I told you that the only official document they have to be verified is actually the tax return like which of the document can like, for example, even my stocks right like, how many stocks have I used this year, or like bought new stocks like, how would they know about it unless I file it next year? Correct. 261 00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.030 Siraj Nazir: So. 262 00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.210 Jenny Duan: Wait, scroll up. 263 00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.480 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. So we don't have to disclose. Everything is. My point is that. 264 00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.490 Jenny Duan: You should. You should say that you should report you received Snap this year, don't you, Ludo? 265 00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.550 Jenny Duan: Assisted lunch program. 266 00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.629 Jenny Duan: Wait! I I just saw that page. I'm not sure what it was referring to. 267 00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:56.499 huda: Yeah, wait, let me go back. But I think that might be like us, cause I don't know if I actually apply for it, because in California, like obviously, they, they give free lunch to everyone. So I don't know if there's like that program like. 268 00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.290 Maryam: It's in Lusd, it is free lunch. 269 00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.440 Maryam: Alright. 270 00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.000 huda: Oh, I thought it was for entire California, but. 271 00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.960 Maryam: No, not Usd and other schools. 272 00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.400 huda: Let me go back! 273 00:25:1",
    "1.760 --> 00:25:14.099 Jenny Duan: Yeah, go back to that page. 274 00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:49.780 huda: Also over here. It says, do they expect like a significant income change in 2025? I said, no, because 275 00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.900 huda: I mean, like, it's already, I think 2024 276 00:25:53.422 --> 00:25:56.320 huda: is like the is where the change happened. 277 00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:57.410 huda: So 278 00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:02.560 huda: yeah, here. 279 00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:09.210 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would say, yes, get that because you don't. You receive cow boxes like, that's the same thing. 280 00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.180 Jenny Duan: Okay. 281 00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.370 Jenny Duan: yeah. 282 00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:15.720 Jenny Duan: Do. 283 00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.070 Jenny Duan: are you on free or reduced price. Lunch? Yes. 284 00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.980 Jenny Duan: yes. 285 00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.370 Jenny Duan: okay. 286 00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.050 Jenny Duan: great. And then 287 00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:31.470 Jenny Duan: I think everything that can be tracked to a tax form needs to be reported correctly. 288 00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.070 huda: There's no. 289 00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:36.450 Jenny Duan: Way around that, but you can report 290 00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.159 Jenny Duan: business losses if you did that. 291 00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:49.909 huda: Oh, also here, instead of saying, like like the actual company that my dad worked at just a text. 292 00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.609 Jenny Duan: You don't have to be that specific. 293 00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.649 Jenny Duan: They're super nosy. You don't need to disclose everything. 294 00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.769 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, yeah, I think that's our point. See? At the end of the day 295 00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:07.760 Siraj Nazir: what can cause an alarm right? When, if you give an inaccurate information about your tax return. Then I I can agree. Right? That's the only thing th",
    "at's verifiable. 296 00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:08.870 Jenny Duan: Yes. 297 00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.310 huda: Yeah, see? They they ask about like, the. 298 00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.830 Jenny Duan: Your value of your house. Okay, it's fine. 299 00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:23.490 Jenny Duan: it's fine. I mean, you live in the Bay Area. So housing prices are just inflated because of that. And they know that. So that's okay. 300 00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.270 Jenny Duan: let's see. 301 00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.184 huda: Then, after this it asked about like my siblings. 302 00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.630 Jenny Duan: Yes, you have one sibling in in college. Make sure you report that, and then you have another sibling. 303 00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.470 huda: And then I also asked about, like my sister's, like 304 00:27:40.045 --> 00:27:41.710 huda: tuition, and everything. 305 00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:48.370 Jenny Duan: Tell her. Tell them your tuition, and oh, you can increase this cost. The total cost to attend the school 306 00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:59.870 Jenny Duan: include everything, her housing, her tuition her the gas it costs to drive between schools like anything that she would spend in college. You need to include all of it. 307 00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.009 Jenny Duan: Because, yeah, like that is good. Because then, like. 308 00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:15.009 Jenny Duan: they'll see that like, you have more expenses. And like, yeah, just this is something you can report up like, basically anything that costs her to go to school, anything related to school. You report it here. 309 00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.540 huda: Yeah, I'm gonna 310 00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:23.650 huda: say, I don't know if this is talking about all 4 years. But I'm gonna see, like around 70,000 for all 4 years. 311 00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.350 Jenny Duan: I think this is maybe like we can scroll up, maybe like one per year. 312 00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.200 huda: Oh, okay. 313 00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.420",
    " Jenny Duan: Per year, do it per year. 314 00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.350 huda: Watch this already too much, then. 315 00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:34.430 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 316 00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.310 huda: I'll just say 50. 317 00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:43.740 Jenny Duan: Tuition fees for housing food supplies, any textbooks the cost to drive like back and forth like 318 00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:48.650 Jenny Duan: the clothes that she's buying for school like anything like that can all be counted here. 319 00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.489 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but 320 00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.470 Jenny Duan: don't over inflate it too much, because like. 321 00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.200 Jenny Duan: but just do something that you feel like encompasses all the educational expenses. 322 00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.510 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 323 00:29:00.483 --> 00:29:02.680 huda: Do you think this is accurate, Paula? 324 00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:15.029 Siraj Nazir: I mean, education expenses would include everything right like you know. It's not just for like, only for Samia, right. 325 00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.490 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, only for her sister. 326 00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.710 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean, is there a way for them to verify like? Is it only. 327 00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:26.369 Jenny Duan: They can check the cost of attendance for the school, so like they can look up like Cal Poly. Cost of attendance. 328 00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.039 Maryam: Apart from that, the housing is like 15,000. 329 00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:32.870 Maryam: Is it. 330 00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.590 Siraj Nazir: Is it only like tuition or tuition, or what. 331 00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.980 Maryam: No, it's everything. 332 00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.939 Jenny Duan: Everything. Tuition housing her meal. Plan? Yeah. 333 00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.670 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, okay. 334 00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:44.800 Jenny Duan: Fine. Then it's fine. 335 00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.720 Maryam: So it's 40 50,0",
    "00, I think, would be perfect. I think. 336 00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:57.219 Jenny Duan: 50,000. Yeah, because they can. They can look it up, too. So it shouldn't be too high, because they know you live. They know, you're in state. So that's yeah. 337 00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.869 huda: Yeah, I think 50,000. 338 00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 339 00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:03.529 huda: Good. Yeah. 340 00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:04.010 Jenny Duan: Okay. 341 00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.340 huda: The same for this. 342 00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.429 Maryam: Oh, it's just. 343 00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.800 huda: Oh. 344 00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.569 huda: you know what. 345 00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.840 Maryam: That's 4,000. 346 00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.520 huda: Or 347 00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.710 huda: 40. 348 00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.402 huda: Yeah. And then this 349 00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.859 huda: most of the stuff was not applicable. And for the college programs I put in. 350 00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.159 huda: Stanford, Usc, Georgia, Tech. 351 00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.970 Maryam: That's. 352 00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.459 huda: Eastern Northeastern, Unc. 353 00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:12.319 huda: Bernard Cornell, Nyu Carnegie, Mellon Brown University. I was trying to add, like uiuc, but for some reason it doesn't. I don't think they accept Css. 354 00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.119 Jenny Duan: Not every school accepts. Css, yeah. 355 00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.350 huda: Yeah. 356 00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.250 huda: Then I think I think that's all for the Css form. 357 00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.330 huda: You guys, do you guys think I should submit it? No. 358 00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:38.240 Siraj Nazir: So I think to summarize right again. It's very important to internalize this, Maria, and you know it's it's going to be confusing. So css, now, profile that so this is this per college, or is this like one common thing? Jenny. 359 00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.030 Jenny",
    " Duan: It's 1 common thing that's sent to all the colleges. 360 00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.769 Siraj Nazir: Full form of Css. Just curious. 361 00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.000 Jenny Duan: It's just like, so they can get more information out of you. 362 00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.589 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's not. That's it. 363 00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.539 Siraj Nazir: And Fafsa form, like, you know. So Css. Goes to a particular college. 364 00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.370 Jenny Duan: It goes to every college that you put on your list. 365 00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:05.060 Siraj Nazir: Okay. So Huda has to specify all the colleges now, or one by one right, whenever she's applying right, it will go as like an addendum or a pack attachment? Yeah. 366 00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah, basically. 367 00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:07.610 Jenny Duan: okay, so. 368 00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:14.000 Siraj Nazir: So. If I remember correctly, you said sorry. I'm a bit distracted with this customer once today. Unfortunately. 369 00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.500 Jenny Duan: Problem. 370 00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.109 Siraj Nazir: So basically, you're saying that 371 00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:25.729 Siraj Nazir: now it goes. Of course, you know, Huda Huda doesn't really like look, you know, of course, you know the the 2023, unfortunately, is not a low income thing. But then 372 00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:33.030 Siraj Nazir: you have entered that. You know, this year. Of course, there are circumstances right? So that's kind of the additional information so hopefully. 373 00:32:33.747 --> 00:32:36.309 Siraj Nazir: But when a decision is made. 374 00:32:37.074 --> 00:32:43.669 Siraj Nazir: so help you know. Explain that as well, because Marim is also on the call, like, you know, the need blind versus like. 375 00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:51.120 Siraj Nazir: how does that work, Jenny? Like? So this goes now, Stanford and all the top schools. Right? They're expensive schools. 376 00:32:51.120 --> 00:33:02.86",
    "0 Jenny Duan: They don't see this when they make your decision. So if, for example, at Stanford, they guarantee you aid, so your financial aid is not like attached to your application. They don't see it unless you are admitted. 377 00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:27.280 Jenny Duan: And then, after you're admitted, they can see that like. Okay, this is this will calculate an estimated family contribution. I think it will tell you after you submit. Maybe your estimated family contribution, which is like how much they estimate that you'll be able to pay at these institutions, and usually the school will then give you financial aid, so that you only pay your estimated financial contribution. So if your estimated financial contribution is 378 00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:43.350 Jenny Duan: 15,000, then they'll give you aid, so that you only pay 15,000. If it's 0, then they'll give you aid, so you only pay 0. But this has no bearing on whether or not you are admitted. So this is only on financial aid. If they're need blind, which means they don't look at your need for financial aid when they admit you. 379 00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.110 Siraj Nazir: In most of the colleges are deemed blind right. 380 00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.810 Jenny Duan: Yes. 381 00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.370 Siraj Nazir: And which colleges are need based. 382 00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.840 Siraj Nazir: like. 383 00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.899 Jenny Duan: No school that you would want to go to. Most of, like the top schools are all are all blind. 384 00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.339 Siraj Nazir: You. You see that right, Mariel. I think that's a key point here. Right? So 385 00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:11.669 Siraj Nazir: But again, like, you know, there are ways probably like. So I mean with the affirmative law, you know, it's not even like there are no prompts anymore. Right? That actually talk about your 386 00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.610 Siraj Nazir: gender identity and background, and all that stuff. 387 00:34:15.050 --> 00",
    ":34:29.959 Siraj Nazir: But still, like, you know, there are narratives that people mentioned, but they cannot. Technically they cannot use it. That was the whole Howard thing that came out right on how they were trying to like make decisions based on different kind of factors. Correct, Jenny, is that what it is. 388 00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:35.739 Jenny Duan: Not. This is not a weight into your decision like this will only come after you are admitted. 389 00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.409 Maryam: Okay? And then what's it? 390 00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:38.629 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! Sorry. 391 00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:43.600 Maryam: No. What's the difference between Csn and Fafsa? 392 00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:56.750 Jenny Duan: Used to calculate Federal aid. So Fasa is what the Government uses to calculate whether or not the Government will give you a loan or a grant, for example, a Pell grant. But Css. Is for every school to calculate, like through their own financial aid system. 393 00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:57.930 Maryam: Oh yes! 394 00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:11.339 Jenny Duan: Css. Is not used for government aid. Yeah? And then, after you get admitted, Huda, like I said, there's a high likelihood that you'll need to file an appeal. So most likely the initial offer they give you is not going to be like 395 00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:27.689 Jenny Duan: as much financial aid that you'll get in the long term in the at the end, because you'll probably need to file another appeal to explain to Re, explain your situation because of those 2023 tax records, but after you appeal they should be able to increase your aid. 396 00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:29.719 Jenny Duan: To be more accurate. Yeah. 397 00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.779 huda: Alright also, I had a question for this one. It says, like 398 00:35:34.194 --> 00:35:42.960 huda: how much does what they expect to receive from the following resources to pay for educational expenses for the 2025 to 26 academic year. 399 00:35:43.404 --> 00:35:44.",
    "700 huda: I don't know. Like 400 00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.179 huda: I don't know if I'm supposed to make this like a larger number, or a smaller number. 401 00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.130 Jenny Duan: So 402 00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.530 Jenny Duan: maybe you can just say like 5,000 would be fine. 403 00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:04.320 Jenny Duan: or maybe 1,000 is also fine, like I think you'll you'll be eligible for full aid. So I don't really think it like, I think 1,000 is fine here. 404 00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.320 Jenny Duan: Then, yeah, obviously, don't say you're gonna do scholarships. Don't say you're gonna do employers or anything. Yeah. 405 00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.310 Jenny Duan: And then 406 00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:25.639 Jenny Duan: a little bit careful about reporting business losses, because I think earlier, you mentioned that your Dad's unemployed. I don't think you said he was a small business owner, so if you're reporting like business losses, that might be a bit contradictory. 407 00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.769 Jenny Duan: does that make sense? You know. 408 00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.170 Jenny Duan: Or I don't know what the exact prompt was for that. 409 00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:40.270 huda: Yeah, actually, I might, instead of saying unemployed, I could change it to self employed. I don't know which one gives me a more advantage. 410 00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.150 huda: Yeah. 411 00:36:41.628 --> 00:36:43.540 Jenny Duan: Self-employed would be good. 412 00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.170 Jenny Duan: because if you're going to report business any losses, then there has to be like some type of employment there. 413 00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.270 Siraj Nazir: I mean, but it is important to report the businesses now right. 414 00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.630 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Report as many losses as you can. 415 00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.809 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. See? That's the that's the loophole here. Yeah. 416 00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:08.290 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So what",
    "ever you're investing into ivy level like, just report that as a loss like, it's very. 417 00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.444 Siraj Nazir: So how does that get verified right 418 00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.059 Siraj Nazir: And Jenny, like. 419 00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:23.110 Jenny Duan: If you file like an independent contractor's tax, it's just whatever you report on your tax form. So if you're filing losses on your taxes, then should match this. 420 00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.910 Siraj Nazir: Okay? So basically, yeah, it's gonna be that 1 0 9 9 form, right? 421 00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:27.790 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 1090. 422 00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:31.120 huda: I? I said that. I said that 423 00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:41.829 huda: the Iv level was actually started, or like filed in 2024 because I didn't. I checked our forms, and I couldn't find any like specific numbers. 424 00:37:42.194 --> 00:37:48.900 huda: So then I just, I just mentioned that like, oh, we started in 2024. But it's running at a loss. 425 00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.049 Siraj Nazir: It was actually in 2023, actually. So 426 00:37:52.395 --> 00:37:57.764 Siraj Nazir: yeah, it's always been reported as loss as well. Yeah. So let's let's connect on that 427 00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.639 Siraj Nazir: I did file it to with with Delaware. Actually. So. 428 00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.489 huda: It's a different trial cause, cause I didn't see it in the. 429 00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:13.179 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, yeah, it's not there. It's it's separate. It was separately filed right? I I filed the business separately. So. 430 00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.093 Siraj Nazir: but I think last year again. So 431 00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:26.749 Siraj Nazir: there was no earning, basically might be there was some earning. But there, like, I think, I think, in the in the tax filing like we did not really pay any taxes or anything of that sort. So 432 00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:34.450 Siraj Nazir: so we have to show losses. Right? I mean, is there a ",
    "particular form like a field or something Jenny, that basically talks about. 433 00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:39.959 Jenny Duan: There, there should be a field about losses, so I think you should look. Take a look for that 434 00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:42.339 Jenny Duan: cause. That will be important. 435 00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.670 Siraj Nazir: Okay. 436 00:38:45.222 --> 00:38:48.249 Siraj Nazir: and we also have shams right? Without the other one. 437 00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.439 huda: Yeah, I found that one. 438 00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.039 Jenny Duan: And yeah, income can be 0. That should be. 439 00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.280 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 440 00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.740 Siraj Nazir: so is there a specific field that says we incurred losses or. 441 00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.369 Jenny Duan: I think Sohuda like, did you? 442 00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.790 Jenny Duan: And you're filling. 443 00:39:04.197 --> 00:39:05.420 huda: Let me show 444 00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:08.690 huda: it's like, there's basically there's. 445 00:39:09.093 --> 00:39:11.109 Siraj Nazir: If you can. I mean. 446 00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.670 huda: Yeah, you have to go through like a bunch of pages. That's why it's taking me so long. 447 00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:21.220 Siraj Nazir: Okay, yeah. Just just hop onto like a seams is like another kind of small business, like, you know, my wife's business. 448 00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.364 huda: Yeah, so it has like one page for each for each business. 449 00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.900 huda: let me go to that. 450 00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:32.110 huda: Okay. 451 00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.769 huda: okay, so I said, 2 businesses. 452 00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.290 huda: this one. 453 00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.750 huda: And I said that the market value is $10,000. 454 00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.620 huda: but I don't know if this should. This should. 455 00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.200 huda: I don't know if this is 456 00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.720 huda: how I'",
    "m supposed to fill it out. But 457 00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:57.860 huda: I didn't. 458 00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.309 Jenny Duan: Market value. Maybe I would say. 459 00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:05.270 Jenny Duan: market value. What is market value? 460 00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.300 Jenny Duan: Oh. 461 00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.880 huda: That's wait. This could be 0, right? 462 00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.349 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it could be 0. 463 00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:14.080 huda: Yeah. 464 00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.749 Jenny Duan: How much do you owe on the business. 465 00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.780 huda: Yeah, I checked the forms. And this is. 466 00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.840 huda: I think 467 00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.169 huda: it was like a negative number. So. 468 00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.210 Jenny Duan: Negative? What. 469 00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.649 huda: Wasn't this negative? 1, 30,992. 470 00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.150 Jenny Duan: On the tax return. 471 00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.810 huda: Yeah. 472 00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.800 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 473 00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.979 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, negative negative like loss loss. We have to report losses. 474 00:40:40.295 --> 00:40:40.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 475 00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.090 Siraj Nazir: You know I'd be smart. 476 00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.369 Jenny Duan: 9. You can say 0 right now. 477 00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.889 Jenny Duan: but, like I don't think. 478 00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.220 Siraj Nazir: Actually, Huda, the name of the business is Gigsby Hudar. It's not Iv level. 479 00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.040 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. 480 00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.089 Siraj Nazir: You don't even know like how Iv level is written. 481 00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.580 huda: Asking you, Ashley, and you don't. 482 00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.759 Siraj Nazir: You're like. Oh, my God, it's it's. 483 00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.990 Jenny Duan: Okay, and then amount owed. I don't think you owe money on that. 48",
    "4 00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.520 Siraj Nazir: No, the gigs BGIG, ZBI could not get gigs. B, 485 00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.200 Siraj Nazir: and that's where I met Jenny. Actually. 486 00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:09.950 huda: Wait! Wait! How 487 00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:11.610 huda: is this? Bill? 488 00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.700 Siraj Nazir: GIGZ. B. 489 00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.760 Siraj Nazir: Capital. All capital. Yeah. 490 00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:21.549 Siraj Nazir: I think there was a Gigsby in California, but not in Delaware. So this is the 491 00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.439 Siraj Nazir: the the only license. 492 00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.839 Jenny Duan: Owed I don't know if you owe money on it, so I'd maybe just put 0 for this. 493 00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.510 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 494 00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:30.490 huda: Yeah. 495 00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.019 Jenny Duan: I don't think you have any debt in this. 496 00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.320 Jenny Duan: So yeah, then, yes. 497 00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.049 huda: I think they'll change it a lot. Yeah. 498 00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:41.670 Jenny Duan: I will change it a lot. Yeah, the losses are, yeah, definitely good. Who to? Your 499 00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:44.790 Jenny Duan: not filed. And you don't need to report any income here. 500 00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:55.150 huda: Yeah, and then what was I gonna say? It also said that. The I'm eligible for the fee waiver. So I think that's that's a good sign, I guess. 501 00:41:55.150 --> 00:42:01.529 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's a good set, like, I think I think you should get full aid, probably at any of these institutions 502 00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.640 Jenny Duan: so hopefully, that would be good. 503 00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:32.480 Jenny Duan: But yeah, the thing is like, you need to keep on reapplying every single year for this financial aid, which is bad, because, like, even if it gives you fully one year, you need to reapply the next year and the next year and the next year, a",
    "nd they'll redo your aid calculation every year, but at least like, for now you should be fine, but also so this is only one thing, and then, for all the scholarships that we're applying. For once you get your Fafsa, make sure that you get like Pell, grant eligibility, because that will help you for your. 504 00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:42.029 huda: Unc gave me like beta beta access to the Fafsa form. So I think I might fill that out after I submit this as well. 505 00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. Great 506 00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.450 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think Gates is already 507 00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.330 Jenny Duan: not open. 508 00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.319 Siraj Nazir: So Jenny is a Fafsa expert. When I met her 1st right 509 00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.639 Siraj Nazir: she was like all talking about Fafsa the 1st time I heard about Fafsa at that time. 510 00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:09.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Fafsa doesn't open until December first.st Do you know why they give you early access or beta access? Did they tell you why, or were they like? Did they say. 511 00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:19.580 huda: It's like Unc, I think, is one of the colleges that are like working with Fafsa for like a Beta program. So I don't think it's specific to me, but it was like specific to the college. 512 00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.020 Jenny Duan: Okay. Yeah. Great sounds good. 513 00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:25.950 Maryam: Let's see. 514 00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:31.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah, let me think of other than that, like the scholarships that we've 515 00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:35.899 Jenny Duan: we've talked about. I mean, you're applying to all of them. 516 00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.570 Jenny Duan: yeah. 517 00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.619 Jenny Duan: Are you applying to all the major ones? 518 00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:44.640 Jenny Duan: There's just. 519 00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.299 Jenny Duan: oh, one more that I think. 520 00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:50.989 Maryam: You should have 5",
    ". 521 00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.870 Jenny Duan: For. 522 00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:04.920 Jenny Duan: Oh, here's 1 another one. I don't think this is on your list. 523 00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:05.870 Maryam: I think. 524 00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.989 Jenny Duan: This one's due in 2 days. I just found it. 525 00:44:10.045 --> 00:44:14.469 Jenny Duan: If you can submit this in 2 days, that would be great. But you also don't need to. 526 00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.160 Jenny Duan: It's not feasible, but I feel like you've. 527 00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.850 huda: I mean, I think I can. But if it requires like a transcript or something, I think that would be. That might be a problem. 528 00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.649 Jenny Duan: Look at the applicant how to apply. 529 00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:50.909 Jenny Duan: the thing is most most of these scholarships like this one, for example, it's not gonna matter for you, because it's only unmet age. So because you're going to be receiving significant financial aid from your college, like 530 00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:57.429 Jenny Duan: most of these scholarships, are not actually going to do anything because they only give you money if like. You're not receiving it from your institution. 531 00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:18.720 Jenny Duan: Unlike unlike some of these other ones like Elks. It's not a last dollar scholarship, so it doesn't. So the money that they give you is separate from the institutions like financially. But this one, for example like, I don't know if this is necessarily worth your time, but you could, if you want to, because they only give it to you. If your school doesn't give it to you. But like, since all the institutions that you're applying to will likely give you the aid anyways 532 00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.189 Jenny Duan: probably won't make a difference. For you. 533 00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.700 Jenny Duan: yeah. 534 00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.749 huda: Okay, it looks like it's asking for 2 academic recommendations. And.",
    " 535 00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.730 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, then perhaps not. 536 00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.990 Maryam: Okay. 537 00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.509 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean. 538 00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.699 Jenny Duan: other than that, I feel like. 539 00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.249 Jenny Duan: yeah, I feel like, you're good. 540 00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:45.900 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 541 00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.799 Jenny Duan: you should be good. 542 00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.649 Jenny Duan: In terms of financial aid. Fafsa opens on December first, st 543 00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.849 Jenny Duan: for Unc. Do you know, when Stanford decisions come out, it's like one month, right? 544 00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:01.700 huda: Yeah December, December. 545 00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.599 Siraj Nazir: 15.th How can you forget her, Jenny. 546 00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah. It's a big day. Fif 15, th right? 547 00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:15.029 huda: Yeah, it's also it's kind of intimidating, because it's like the week before my finals. So. 548 00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:22.779 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's fine, like, if if you get into Stanford great, if you don't get into Stanford, there will be another school like. 549 00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.590 Siraj Nazir: Exactly. Yeah. 550 00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:33.820 Jenny Duan: Like Huda, you'll get into an amazing school like I'm so proud of you. You've worked so hard like your essays are amazing. Your stats look amazing like. I don't think you need to be worried so much, but. 551 00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:34.760 Siraj Nazir: Exactly. 552 00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.689 Jenny Duan: When does Usc come out, do you know, for their early stuff. 553 00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.090 huda: January 20.th 554 00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:41.260 Jenny Duan: That's kind of late for early. 555 00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.170 Jenny Duan: What about you? Let's see you. 556 00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.610 huda: Unc is also in like around. 557 00:46:46.620 -->",
    " 00:46:49.360 huda: I believe it's also around January. 558 00:46:50.027 --> 00:46:52.289 huda: Wait, let me just double check. 559 00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:06.020 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, anyways. And and I think you know, I think you've done your best you. You shouldn't be attached to any of these, you know, it's all gonna happen like you. I mean, you will find a good place where you will really thrive and succeed. 560 00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:12.099 Siraj Nazir: So that's perfectly fine, you know I pushed you as well to get into these, but I think that was just like 561 00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:18.100 Siraj Nazir: only a reason for you to already grow and succeed, and you're already like grown and succeeded, like you know, to 562 00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:24.119 Siraj Nazir: like from starting from a point where you are like. So I still remember, like, you know, those initial 563 00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:30.869 Siraj Nazir: days where you are having these sessions, even with Janice. And you know, Jenny just came fresh and like she started this whole thing. 564 00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.769 Siraj Nazir: It's been amazing, right? Like for you to be like a founder, raise money, run hackathons, you know, that is real real growth. Right? 565 00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:40.920 Siraj Nazir: So 566 00:47:42.023 --> 00:47:44.276 Siraj Nazir: yeah. And I think, 567 00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.120 Siraj Nazir: that is already success in my view. 568 00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.950 Siraj Nazir: you know. 569 00:47:49.950 --> 00:48:05.670 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, sorry. The next step for you is also, like all of these scholarship awards, like, I think that is going to be a big priority this year, especially like, I think Amazon future engineers. I really think you're like the perfect candidate for that. So I really want you to win that one. 570 00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.610 Jenny Duan: yeah. 571 00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:14.407 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. Uda, we all need money. Uda, please get get us more funding, ",
    "you know, when keep winning these scholarships. 572 00:48:15.465 --> 00:48:15.790 Jenny Duan: And. 573 00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.460 Siraj Nazir: Give it to your parents. That's it. It's very simple. Yeah. 574 00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:24.130 Jenny Duan: Amazon future engineer. Scholarship, I believe. When is the deadline for that? Again? 575 00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:24.500 huda: This. 576 00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.379 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, December 19, th yeah. So that one's huge. 577 00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:32.720 Jenny Duan: I think you're like, really a good candidate for that. 578 00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.810 huda: Like, yeah, I think I'm gonna have 579 00:48:36.077 --> 00:48:41.740 huda: it asked for like a recommendation. And at 1st I wanted to have my English teacher do it. But I think 580 00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:46.960 huda: like seeing as it's a like an engineering one. I think I'll just ask my computer science teacher. 581 00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that would be really good. 582 00:48:49.980 --> 00:49:01.970 Siraj Nazir: And, Jenny, I know that you won so many awards, you know, during senior year, which I still it's hard for me to believe, because you said Oh, from no awards I asked Jenny like, what's your weakness? She said. Oh, from no awards to Stanford, I'm like, you know. Come on. 583 00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.420 Siraj Nazir: but when you told me and I I take you for that like, you know. 584 00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:12.230 Siraj Nazir: so any any specific things that Hoda needs to have in our radar, because, you know, that can always be like 585 00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.889 Siraj Nazir: morale boosting and profile boosting like I saw in secret impact award. 586 00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:18.949 Siraj Nazir: Is that something she can apply to. 587 00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:23.390 Jenny Duan: I think. Nc. Where it's fine. She already got the national award. I don't. It's. 588 00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:26.500 Siraj Nazir: This is an impact",
    " award, right? Isn't that like more prestigious. 589 00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:44.080 Jenny Duan: I think, for the purposes of college admissions. What she has is already great for that. I think the next thing would be just like, I really hope that you can get Amazon. Future engineers like that's the one program that I think would be like a really really good fit for you. Obviously, Elks is great. 590 00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:55.069 Jenny Duan: and like the other scholarships that we are, have on our radar like, we have a list of those. So I think, like just making sure that you're sticking to those deadlines and getting those in would be nice. 591 00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.509 Jenny Duan: And then the next deadline is like the University of California essays which are due on November 30, th right. 592 00:50:01.933 --> 00:50:03.189 huda: Yeah, I think. 593 00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.619 huda: actually, I think this year they moved it to December, second or, something like that. 594 00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:18.649 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, yeah. Well, it's like, it's like around that time. And then your regular decisions. And I think because you have fee waivers for colleges like it's pretty advantageous for you to just like. Apply for as many. 595 00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:20.049 huda: Yeah, I, actually decided, 596 00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.720 Jenny Duan: Coolest as you can. 597 00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:33.868 huda: Yeah, I decided, a bunch of random colleges like Barnard and like, I wasn't gonna apply to Cornell. But I feel like I feel like I should just apply to the ivy's just just cause. But. 598 00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:39.239 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I like, you have fee waivers. So you're not paying like $90 per application. 599 00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:43.990 Jenny Duan: So I mean, I think, common app? Does it? Common app, cap you at 30? 600 00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:44.990 Jenny Duan: Alright! 601 00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.850 huda: Think, so, yeah. 602 00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:49",
    ".740 Jenny Duan: 30, but 30 is like, I don't think you need to apply to more than 30 schools. 603 00:50:49.890 --> 00:51:12.370 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I'd like, say, apply to all the Ivs apply to any school that you feel like you are remotely interested in going to. But I think if you're not interested in going to a school don't apply for it, even if it's a prestigious school, because, like you should only apply to schools that you want to go to, regardless of their prestige. So if there's a school that you think is prestigious, but you wouldn't want to go to. There's I don't think it's there's a point in applying for it. 604 00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:26.189 Siraj Nazir: So Jen, I mean, let's focus on the the Iv plus, like, you know, Iv schools, right? Iv is like, you know, what? What would you? What? What is the target? And like, you know, who does target list right now? I mean, of course, you know, Stan, I mean, these are like reach right. 605 00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:34.659 Jenny Duan: I think, like Barnard would be like a target like an example of a target school. Barnard would be like, really good. I think Huda can get into like 606 00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:44.960 Jenny Duan: Georgia tech, like schools like, I think those are like pretty target like schools like they're competitive hard to get into like Cornell. I feel like you have a really good chance that getting into 607 00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:53.130 Jenny Duan: like anything I think in like the I think you'll definitely get into like the twenties. For sure, but like 608 00:51:53.250 --> 00:52:01.579 Jenny Duan: I think Berkeley like, I think you would be a good fit for, like Santa Cruz like Usc. I think, like all these schools, you would be a really good fit, for it's just like. 609 00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:17.779 Jenny Duan: like, I think you're at that. You're at like threshold. It's just like it's a matter of fit like if it's not like, are you not qualified because you're qualified? I don't think that's the proble",
    "m. It's like, Are you a good fit for this institution? Or do they think, do they think that they are a good fit for you? I think that's the only thing. 610 00:52:18.529 --> 00:52:19.139 Jenny Duan: So. 611 00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:41.450 Siraj Nazir: Let's be honest, right, you know, when you go to like, you know, top like, you know. Hypsm, I mean, there's always going to be more competition. They're like very strong profiles. But again, the good thing is like the diversity, like, you know, that identity and narrative. Now that I'm looking at so many applications. Impressive like, you know, there are so many admits. Actually, it's hard to believe that they got in, you know, because they didn't really have, but they had something very unique. And I think 612 00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:50.360 Siraj Nazir: that is the of course, you know, there are, of course, like 30%, very highly. Quant kind of, you know, a big brains, you know, that. Get in 613 00:52:50.653 --> 00:53:00.909 Siraj Nazir: but like Jenny as an example like she didn't have like a very big spike in anything, but she was like Jack of all trades, and I think that's what Huda is very similar profile. So hopefully, you know. 614 00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:25.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think you'll be. I think you'll do good. I mean, like it just also depends on like some things that you don't know, like the strength of your recommendations, like those, will probably be good. But, like you don't know about that, like, there's just like some factors outside of your control per se. But like, I think you'll definitely go to a good school like, I don't think you need to be worried about going to a good school. It's just like, which of these good schools is it gonna be? 615 00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:33.479 Jenny Duan: But like, yeah, I think like Barnard would be a good fit like you should also apply to Columbia, like, you know, stuff like that, I think 616 00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:37.010 Jenny Duan: mit like, I think all these sch",
    "ools. 617 00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:46.039 huda: I think the thing with Mit is it has like a separate application, and I'm applying there anyway. But like cause I I remember, though. 618 00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.259 Jenny Duan: They have their own portal. Yeah. 619 00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:53.460 huda: That was like the 1st program I think you showed, which was like the comparative media that one. 620 00:53:53.825 --> 00:53:56.750 Siraj Nazir: Has become amazing. I mean they I mean. 621 00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:03.759 Siraj Nazir: I showed Jenny. I took some snapshots. I I could not even recognize if it was like mit cool. 622 00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.600 Jenny Duan: Amazing. Yeah, it's great. 623 00:54:07.337 --> 00:54:20.360 Jenny Duan: I think you'd be a good fit for like, I know, like I, I know, like I have so much conviction that, like you're gonna be somewhere great. It's just like, I don't want you to get your emotions attached to any one specific school, because, like 624 00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:25.829 Jenny Duan: you never really like. I don't know. I don't think you never, ever really know, but I think like. 625 00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:26.610 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 626 00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.810 Jenny Duan: No, you'll go somewhere. 627 00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:33.910 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean, what is that statistic? I mean, you can say, I mean, that's fine. We you know, we can talk about guns now. 628 00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.639 Siraj Nazir: Oh, Hi! 629 00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:41.390 Jenny Duan: Gonna say, like, you're more likely to get shot or to survive a bullet to the head than to like get into Stanford. 630 00:54:42.026 --> 00:54:42.640 huda: Like this. 631 00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.350 Jenny Duan: Terms of probability. But, like. 632 00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.040 Jenny Duan: I don't know, I think you'll be fine 633 00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:51.399 Jenny Duan: like the like if you think about it. Like, if you apply 634 00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:52.870 Jenny Duan: to",
    " like. 635 00:54:52.910 --> 00:55:05.060 Jenny Duan: okay, the chance of getting into one top school is like what? 5% sure. But then, if you apply to like funny schools and every school, you have a chance. 5% chance. Then, like the chance you get into, one of them is higher. Right? So 636 00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.410 Jenny Duan: so it's okay, yeah. 637 00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.430 huda: That's comforting. 638 00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:17.729 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And like also, like, you'll totally just be fine like, who know you're smart. You know that you worked hard like you have such an impressive profile like you'll be fine. 639 00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 640 00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.916 huda: Thank you. 641 00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:28.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but just just like the waiting game is always so hard, because you never know like it's kind of outside of your fate like you do what you can. And then you just like. 642 00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.190 Jenny Duan: have to be like, okay. But like. 643 00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:37.150 huda: Nervous that right now there's there could be someone like that's reading my Stanford application and like 644 00:55:37.507 --> 00:55:40.290 huda: like me up, or something. I don't know. 645 00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:41.050 Jenny Duan: I mean. 646 00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.240 Jenny Duan: you'll totally be fine 647 00:55:44.260 --> 00:56:03.450 Jenny Duan: also, like, just don't even sweat, because, like, think about how how competitive J. Camp was, for example, and like you got into that. Think about Nc wit like how competitive that is. Like you already got that like you have all these signals like, like I said, summer programs are like a good way to guess your application, your admissions for other things 648 00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:18.759 Jenny Duan: right? Especially with these competitive summer programs, so like the fact that you already gone to like a really really competitive summer program means that, like, ",
    "you're competing against the same like, these are the same people that are applying to the colleges that you want to go to. Right? So the fact that you already gone to a top summer program means that, like. 649 00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:24.449 Jenny Duan: you're already doing better than like most of your peers, I would say, Yeah. 650 00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:31.620 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. And you know, I think, see, there's no harm in applying. I mean, I was just telling her about what us presidential scholar 651 00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:37.599 Siraj Nazir: right? I mean, I was going through all the profiles I saw, like a lot of students and coaches have it like, you know, Jenny wanted as well. 652 00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:55.170 Siraj Nazir: I mean again, like I I mean, of course, might be. There are certain base like prerequisites, and if she doesn't mean that's a different story. But if not, then why not? And immediately, like Huda, said, like, Oh, no way like, Come on. I'm from California, like, do you think I said like, yeah. But you got nct right in no cal like you want, so I think 653 00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:05.850 Jenny Duan: Also, it helps that you're from like you're from, not like a super densely like populated region. And like you're from like a more rural area that like definitely helps you even in California. 654 00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.790 Siraj Nazir: Absolutely, Jenny, now that I've been like living and breathing and building this features. Oh, my God! 655 00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:29.720 Siraj Nazir: And you know what like I've been like literally like reviewing these applications. And it's so interesting on how these things make such a huge difference. And I mean kudos to you. Actually, you know, when Jenny came on board like that was the time. And they even discussed like, Hey, your Muslim identity, you know. That's actually a very significant factor. 656 00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.960 Siraj Nazir: And you know, we never even thought about it as a as in. 657 00:",
    "57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.409 Siraj Nazir: And then that can always be a case right? Like people want. 658 00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:43.010 Siraj Nazir: despite all the drama that's happening around. People still want to have like that kind of diverse class, you know. 659 00:57:43.010 --> 00:58:05.600 Jenny Duan: I mean, like, while Stanford invests in so many resources, like every school, like invest in so many resources like Stanford, has, like a Muslim community center like they have staff there, like like fully full time staff, like incubating this community. So like, obviously, they want students with these backgrounds there, and like having intellectual diversity, diversity of culture, diversity in all forms like super important to all of these top schools. So 660 00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.170 Jenny Duan: anything that makes you different is is a strength. Yeah. 661 00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:21.169 Siraj Nazir: And, Jenny, do you know, I don't know if that told you that I did this fun exercise right? And and of course it was. I don't know how much I I don't think it's bias. It was really like a completely different new instance of 662 00:58:21.547 --> 00:58:28.099 Siraj Nazir: what we did was like, you know, we have this like 500 applications now stored right? And what we did was 663 00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:37.260 Siraj Nazir: what I did was as a dad, right. I just took her blind profile, like her entire application, with extracurricular narrative when she had done it like before submitting to Stanford 664 00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:39.979 Siraj Nazir: and So 665 00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:46.489 Siraj Nazir: I ran it with multiple different, like very, very similar kind of profiles. You know, top profiles and stuff like that. 666 00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:48.449 Siraj Nazir: It is very interesting 667 00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:56.020 Siraj Nazir: that how like, you know? The the AI every single time, you know, it would come and pick Huda's profile actually. 668 00:58:56.360 --> 00:5",
    "9:02.340 Siraj Nazir: And and I think the reasoning right again. A very, very interesting reasoning was always the interdisciplinary aspect 669 00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:04.939 Siraj Nazir: that it always said, like, you know. Yes. 670 00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:19.809 Jenny Duan: Now with AI like software engineering, like all those jobs like any job. That is just one specific task is going to be gone like. That's Huda strength. She does many things like it's, it's very valuable, not only for college, but just like for your career. It's very good. Yeah. 671 00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:34.709 Siraj Nazir: And you know, it would basically say, because you know, the whole idea was that it was an admission officer, right? A committee. And then it would basically evaluate every plus and minus. And the the main reason to pick keep picking, like, you know, with multiple different applications, would always be like. Oh. 672 00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:51.399 Siraj Nazir: this profile will be able to add the most impact right and benefit to the Stanford campus. And this is the kind of profile that Stanford expects. It's very interesting, because I always thought about Spike. Right? I think when I look at Howard profile, it's all spike, Spike, Spike, Spike, Mike. It's a very Stanford thingy, I guess right. 673 00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:56.509 Jenny Duan: Definitely. Stanford. Every school like has their own predisposition because they want to 674 00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:23.729 Jenny Duan: like have a certain student body. So like Harvard, typically, for example, like accepts people who have, like a very big spike in one area, who are like going to be like, I mean Harvard alums. They go, and they maybe are like public figures. They're like diplomats. They're like those statesmen like that's like kind of what Harvard looks for, like. People who are very impressive in one area. But like Stanford people, they're way different. Like, I think Stanford students are more socially minded like they care a",
    "bout having impact like 675 01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:41.409 Jenny Duan: they're more interdisciplinary mit students are like more nerdy, you know, like more stem. They have like a more specific focus. I don't know. Princeton's also very academic, like lots of Princeton students go. Do. Phds, like every school, has its own vibe, so they always want to curate students who are like similar to their student body. 676 01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.299 Siraj Nazir: Awesome. I know your top of the hour so nice to see you, Jenny. It's been a while we need to connect, but 677 01:00:47.560 --> 01:01:02.909 Siraj Nazir: I've also been like. I think the timing was not great, but it's good with us. So you're confident with the Css. Profile. Now I think it's appeal and all that stuff. So I think that process you should need to. You need to learn. Probably watch for Jenny's videos. I guess you know you do have a channel right on Fafsa and other things. 678 01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:12.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, I haven't posted in a while, but I do have one video on it. But I think, yeah, Huda, you'll be totally fine, I think now it's just like the waiting game, and just like 679 01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.059 Jenny Duan: seeing your hard work pay off and like just 680 01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:19.789 Jenny Duan: could work on those scholarship applications a lot cause.
