How's it going. 2 00:08:29.988 --> 00:08:32.320 huda: Hi! Can you hear me? 3 00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.889 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can hear you. 4 00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.429 huda: 1 s. Let me get my camera working. 5 00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:39.589 huda: Okay? Hello, I see. 6 00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.390 Jenny Duan: Hi! How's it going. 7 00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.637 huda: How it's going. Well, I haven't seen you in a while. 8 00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.509 Jenny Duan: I know long time. No see? Any updates. How's everything? 9 00:08:50.648 --> 00:09:05.102 huda: Yeah, I think it's been overall like pretty great these past few weeks. There's been like some good news like I got the games for change. Like. I think I got nominated as one of the finalists for the Game review. 10 00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.900 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh! Congratulations, Huna! That's so amazing! 11 00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:15.359 huda: Yeah, thank you so much. And then a few rejections as well. So the 12 00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.050 huda: the 13 00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.390 huda: the other Journalism conference. I forgot the name of it. That's the. 14 00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, more of like. 15 00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:22.810 huda: Yeah. 16 00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:23.900 Jenny Duan: In the clear. 17 00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:29.210 huda: Yeah, I got rejected from there. And then also, I think I 18 00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:35.789 huda: I didn't get I don't know if you remember what there's like the essay competition. It was like, yeah. 19 00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.388 huda: the make noise today. Thing. I didn't get that. But 20 00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:48.689 huda: Besides that I think I've had some progress with them, primarily like meeting plans and everything and also like 21 00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:02.770 huda: some progress and kind of setting up our organization. Like, I establish new pages for the website. And I'm like we've been planning. So we've planned 3 different events. 22 00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.380 huda: So we're gonna be doing a like AR competition where, like. 23 00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:08.760 Jenny Duan: Oh! 24 00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:32.939 huda: Yeah, and our main motive for that is kind of to teach people like prompt engineering. And like, maybe if if they see any like biases when they're developing it. That's like kind of an option that they can tell us in the Google form. So yeah. And then we're also planning like a hackathon. But that's gonna be like during the summer. Because we do want like a lot of time to plan that 25 00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:59.841 huda: And then the hackathon. It's just gonna be like, I think it's gonna be more of like a broad like hackathon. But it's gonna be focused on like girls. So it's kind of the girls. Only hackathon and I feel like that could definitely grow reach, because, like a lot of people, just join hackathons. So she during the summer. And then another thing we're planning was our keynote speaker. 26 00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:08.089 huda: thing! I think we we haven't gone to do that yet. But, we're trying to do it. In the end of may 27 00:11:08.422 --> 00:11:18.059 huda: and then in between like, if we really do need to have more events, we can do something like with my game. Maybe like having like a showcase or something like that. 28 00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:32.970 huda: And yeah, that's about it for empowering. AI, I mean, I think maybe on the website, I did add like an our team page. So that way, like it could like kind of show up and search more and then 29 00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:59.940 huda: for folklift. I also don't think there's much progress on that. So I actually did like get someone to be, or or my vice President for that. She's like a freshman, I believe. At my school and she already made like an Instagram post for us. So like I think she'd be really motivated to. And she agreed. So yeah, I think 30 00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.949 huda: I think folklit is going a little slower than empowering. Ag, but 31 00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.859 huda: yeah, 32 00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.240 huda: I think. 33 00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:18.307 huda: Oh, yeah. And then I think the professor or not, Professor, but like the teacher, I like one of the local high schools. He replied. Back to my email. 34 00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.490 Jenny Duan: Saw that. 35 00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.610 huda: Yeah. 36 00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.950 huda: it was really cool. 37 00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.230 huda: Yeah. 38 00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.549 Jenny Duan: Have you gotten any other responses since then? 39 00:12:27.144 --> 00:12:28.520 huda: No, just that one. 40 00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.330 huda: That's yeah. 41 00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.799 Jenny Duan: Just keep on sending it out. Hi! How many people do you think you've sent it out to so far? 42 00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.449 huda: I think like 43 00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.610 huda: around like 20. 44 00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.520 Jenny Duan: Okay, I want the number to be like 200. 45 00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.280 huda: Hmm. 46 00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.370 Jenny Duan: I think you need to scale it way more. And I think that will help. 47 00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.348 huda: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. 48 00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.540 huda: yeah. 49 00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:12.495 huda: And then also, I need to write a speech, for like, it's like an acceptance speech for the impact. Like, G forec, award. And so like, it's due on May eighth. But 50 00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:23.870 huda: it's basically like a video which is like 30 to 45 s long. And there's like a like a document that tells you like what to talk about. But yeah. 51 00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:32.809 Jenny Duan: That sounds really awesome. How's your progress with that going? And do you know anything about how many finalists advance to the winning stage, and just how that process works. 52 00:13:33.992 --> 00:13:39.920 huda: I believe my dad was doing a little research. And I think, he said, it's like the top 53 00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.330 huda: 5 are top 10 out of like a hundred submissions. 54 00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.900 huda: Yeah. 55 00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.539 Jenny Duan: Our finalists are our winners. 56 00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.689 huda: Finalists. I think there's only one winner. 57 00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.540 Jenny Duan: Okay. 58 00:13:50.960 --> 00:14:13.259 Jenny Duan: that's super exciting, though, like, regardless of whether or not you become a winner like you are already super impressive as a finalist, and know to know that you, your essay, has been submitted. Subs. Has been selected, sorry out of so many is, is already super impressive, and, like that, is already in a national ward, and of itself so congrats on your second national award like that's huge and so exciting. 59 00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.329 huda: Thank you. 60 00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:23.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So do you have any progress on your acceptance speech so far? Or are you just gonna like wing it? Or how? How do you plan to go about doing that? 61 00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:35.550 huda: I think, this weekend. I'm gonna draft like, maybe a speech of like what I'm gonna say, and we'll record it as well, because, you know, like next week is ap testing, it's kind of gonna ramp up from here. But yeah. 62 00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.399 Jenny Duan: I also meant to ask you how is setting for the Ap's going. 63 00:14:40.136 --> 00:14:49.959 huda: I'd say it's going pretty well, I mean, like my Apcs test is on Tuesday, just really soon. So I think there's gonna be a lot of priming this weekend. 64 00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.550 Jenny Duan: I guess it's gonna be fine for you, though, right like I do. 65 00:14:52.550 --> 00:15:05.909 huda: Yeah, there's a few things that I just like, I don't understand. Like, yeah. But yeah, I don't think I should. I need to study for that one the book. But my, a push test is this Friday. 66 00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:33.533 huda: and that was like kind of one of my more tough ones, and then next week I have ap calc and Ap Ling like back to back. So that's also kind of bad. But I think our preparation for that is going pretty well, especially I think. Ap Ling. I've been consistently getting like nineties or 95 s. On my essay. So. I think my teachers kind of like it's a good indicator of how I'm going to do on like the exam. 67 00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:58.301 huda: And then for calculus we have, like we had our finals. This week. Actually. So it was just like a mock Ap exam, so it's like, our like, our Mcq. With calculator. Non calculator, and then also the Frq's. And everything. So it's like exactly like the Ap. Exam. So I think I did. Well, I'm not sure how I did. But yeah, 68 00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.970 huda: so yeah, I'm hoping that will help me with the Ap. Soon as well. 69 00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:10.507 Jenny Duan: Super cool. Well, I'm sure your Ap's will be fine. I don't think you have too much to worry about, and like also Ap's 70 00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:23.339 Jenny Duan: like in the grand scheme of things. They're also relatively inconsequential to be honest, like, if if you don't get a score you want, you just don't have to report the score on your college application, and that's fine. But obviously it's good to get fives. But 71 00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.790 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay. 72 00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:35.950 Jenny Duan: The next thing I wanted to check in with you. Let's see, have we gone through all of your extra curricular is what else are you gonna say, Apple engineering camp? When do you hear about that? Did they say anything. 73 00:16:36.678 --> 00:16:42.650 huda: They said. They'll let us know in May. But yeah, like, I don't think they give a specific date. 74 00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, what about any of the wait lists like Nhs. Ga. 75 00:16:49.202 --> 00:16:52.100 huda: I haven't got an update from them, either. 76 00:16:52.458 --> 00:17:02.650 huda: But I was also wondering like, should I email them and let them know about like becoming like a finalist for for the games, for change, like, I think that might 77 00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.109 huda: makes my application stronger. So 78 00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:07.099 huda: yeah. 79 00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:13.799 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's actually a really good idea. So you'd like to provide an update. And yeah, that seems good. 80 00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:20.019 Jenny Duan: receive, am I missing anything else? 81 00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.499 Jenny Duan: Oh, really. 82 00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:47.209 Jenny Duan: okay. So the things that are kind of top of mind for me right now are talking about your camera impact scholarship and then talking about some of the other competitions like the video making ones like breakthrough Kona. That's the Khan Academy one the science and master scholarship, etc. So maybe let's just start with the camera impact. I'm wondering, like, have you been able to make any progress on that front? And how's that going. 83 00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:57.646 huda: Honestly, I haven't had like any progress. On those esses. I I kind of feel like I'm having like a tough time like writing about the Esses, because 84 00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.779 huda: I feel like 85 00:18:00.223 --> 00:18:04.046 huda: I don't know. Just like the prompts are like a little bit tough to. 86 00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.389 Jenny Duan: Like super. There's no, they're super tough. Yeah. 87 00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:07.920 huda: Yeah. 88 00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:16.320 Jenny Duan: I feel you for sure. Do you? Do you maybe wanna help brainstorm? Is it the brainstorming? Or where are you getting stuck? Do you think. 89 00:18:17.184 --> 00:18:42.209 huda: I feel like I'm just. I might be like at least, for, like the essay was like the one location would change you. I feel like I'm not focusing on the right thing like I'm kind of trying to tell story, but it might. I might be like going too much in detail, like describing location and like I don't know. Like if I'm portraying the story correctly, because so I'm I'm writing about Starting valley. And I'm talking about like 90 00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:54.640 huda: I guess how the character has to choose between like like supporting the community or like growing economically about it. I cannot having trouble like relating that to myself. 91 00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:56.740 huda: Because, like 92 00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.230 huda: obviously, I guess. 93 00:18:59.968 --> 00:19:06.680 huda: it could relate to like folklift. But at the same time I feel like a lot of the other essays. We brainstorm to be about folklift. 94 00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.020 huda: So yeah, I'm not sure that would work. 95 00:19:10.995 --> 00:19:14.240 Jenny Duan: I think. Like, if you just talk about 96 00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:20.849 Jenny Duan: what's what's one of your big, extra curriculars that you still haven't mentioned in your essay. Also, I'm gonna get on that doc right now. 97 00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.919 Jenny Duan: So we can talk about that. 98 00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.340 Jenny Duan: Are there any of like your extracurriculars that you feel like you haven't gotten the chance to mention yet? 99 00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:34.312 huda: I don't think I ever talk about like 100 00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.530 huda: like being a news anchor, I guess. 101 00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.230 huda: But 102 00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.940 huda: yeah, I feel like that also doesn't relate to the story. But 103 00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.940 huda: maybe. 104 00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.562 Jenny Duan: Maybe if you want to talk about full clift here, where else do you write about? Full Clift? 105 00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.490 Jenny Duan: The leadership 106 00:19:54.910 --> 00:20:01.009 Jenny Duan: leadership? Maybe you can talk about like spreading your voice and bring that one about journalism instead. 107 00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.120 Jenny Duan: What do you think. 108 00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.300 huda: So more about like becoming like a news anchor for for school. 109 00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.085 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 110 00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.579 huda: Okay, yeah, that sounds good 111 00:20:14.183 --> 00:20:17.299 huda: like, when I said, Brian Cameron essays do. By the way. 112 00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.640 Jenny Duan: I think later this month 113 00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.850 Jenny Duan: let me check where I go. 114 00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.289 Jenny Duan: It's due Wednesday, May 20, s. 115 00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.505 huda: Okay. 116 00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.520 Jenny Duan: At noon Pacific time, not 1159. 117 00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.379 huda: Okay, I could probably get it by then. I think I'll especially like after. 118 00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.030 huda: If he exams, I'll be able to like solely work on it and 119 00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:01.052 huda: like, get a lot of it done. But yeah, I think I should start working on this. 120 00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.100 huda: yeah. 121 00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:14.249 Jenny Duan: Sounds good to me. Do you have any other? Are there any other places in this application that you feel stuck about in the essays that maybe we can work and talk through right now. 122 00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.440 huda: like. 123 00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.833 huda: maybe like 124 00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.670 huda: How I can bring up this 125 00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:33.739 huda: is is Number 5, like the Se. Number 5. Is this supposed to be kind of like, turn into a story. It's talking about 126 00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:39.610 huda: on like which schools you want to go to and like, what area of study do you wanna pursue? There. 127 00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:48.570 Jenny Duan: I think this one. You can just write straightforward like, I don't think you need to write a story. You can just say, like, okay, I'm planning to go to this place, this place, this place. And why? 128 00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 129 00:21:50.010 --> 00:22:06.212 huda: Okay? And then number 6. I know we said games for change about like like what career? We envision, or I envision myself for myself. So here like, should I talk about 130 00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.220 huda: kind of how I got into game development or like? 131 00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.970 huda: Why, I'm interested in game development mainly. 132 00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:33.750 Jenny Duan: I think, why you're interested in game development and why game development might be an overlooked or important way for you to impact like public service and public change cause. I think this scholarship is primarily like public service focused a lot. So like, talk about how games for change connects to the public good and like. Why, this is super impactful and important. 133 00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.020 huda: Okay. 134 00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.229 huda: thank you. Mr. 135 00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:45.900 huda: Great. 136 00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.280 huda: okay, I guess. 137 00:22:54.327 --> 00:22:59.100 huda: We for Number 12. Which one did we say? 138 00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.820 huda: We were gonna like, how was I? Gonna connect this again. 139 00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.579 Jenny Duan: Tell us about a location? What was what is your question? What is your question about? Number 12? 140 00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.669 huda: It says, tell us about a location, real or fictional. That has. 141 00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.250 huda: Oh, do you mean the essay. 142 00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.149 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like you, said Number 12, you you had a question about it. 143 00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.690 Jenny Duan: If I have, Chris. 144 00:23:30.228 --> 00:23:40.079 huda: I was wondering like. So I know, I said, start you valley, but I kind of forgot, like how I'm supposed to like connect it to like my own extracurricular 145 00:23:40.437 --> 00:23:43.219 huda: and I think I think you said folklift 146 00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.530 huda: so so like 147 00:23:45.760 --> 00:24:08.159 huda: in the story the character has to choose between, like the kind of ambitious like opportunities. And then the community center so like how can I create like a contrast between that between like folklift. I guess it's just for, like my community with something else, because that's a compared to something else. Like the characters to make decision. 148 00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.780 huda: So like I'm kind of deciding 149 00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:21.788 huda: like. Do you think I can be like oh, instead of just like grabbing like a leadership position and Msa, or like something like that, or 150 00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.350 huda: like. I don't know exactly what to compare it to. 151 00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.201 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like you can compare it to 152 00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.259 Jenny Duan: like within your community how you're able to. First of all, like 153 00:24:36.460 --> 00:25:01.289 Jenny Duan: move beyond, like you can just make a broad generalization about yourself. But then, after that, you can talk about how like going back and looking at your town like this is not so. This is not something to like. Be hide. It's something that you're proud of, and something you want to help. Other people be proud of, too. And that's why you started full flip to like uplift businesses in your area that you know, connect to your background that also, like uplift, the the wellbeing of the 154 00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:06.180 Jenny Duan: not villagers, but like the community members in mountain House. 155 00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:19.379 Jenny Duan: So like, maybe you can say that like what initially you wanted to change. But you ultimately decided that it's better to like, build community and to like find strength in empowering other people through like your work. 156 00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.450 Jenny Duan: The swell. 157 00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.280 huda: That makes sense. 158 00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.690 huda: Yeah, I could probably be able to integrate that in. 159 00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.439 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool sounds good. 160 00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:59.730 Jenny Duan: Any other questions about Brian Cameron? I know that this has been like kind of a struggle for a while, and I know that this is a really hard set of questions. And that's also kind of what one reason why I wanted you to do it is regardless of whether or not you actually win this award like going and practicing these questions will be really really good, because it'll help you so much just thinking about just for thinking about your college applications in general. But do you have any other questions regarding this essay or any other in this application? 161 00:26:00.449 --> 00:26:03.089 huda: No, I think that's it for Brian Cameron. 162 00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:14.809 Jenny Duan: Okay, wonderful. I think. Now, let's spend some time thinking about the the breakthrough challenge, which is the Khan Academy one. Do you have any updates on that front 163 00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.700 Jenny Duan: on your topic. 164 00:26:17.473 --> 00:26:29.286 huda: Not exactly. But also I was like I was kind of wondering, since this challenge is kind of like unrelated from the matrix that I've been looking at. So 165 00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:40.299 huda: like, is it kind of necessary to do something that's like science or math related? On going into like kind of like media studies, or like interactive media. 166 00:26:41.360 --> 00:27:05.790 Jenny Duan: I think it's it connects because it's an opportunity to do science communication. So like, I think your game is a very distinct form of science communication, too, like kind of taking a complicated concept like AI like anything else and using interactive media. So a video, a game, etc. to explain it. So that's why I think it's a good fit for you. Because also it's video making, because it gives you an opportunity to make a video about something. 167 00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:27.879 Jenny Duan: but also it's like a pretty cool scholarship, and it's a big award. But I think, like if if you think it's too technical, or if you feel like you don't want to do it because of that aspect that's like also fine. We could also just move on. It's just kind of out there. I think it could be a good fit, but it depends on like, obviously you have to do it. So whatever you feel like, it's best. 168 00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:45.437 huda: Yeah, I I think I I definitely be interested. But my only issue is that I feel like, I don't really like have enough like interest, and either like math or science like, have a specific topic that I want to talk about, and also, like 169 00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.660 Jenny Duan: You don't want to do it. 170 00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.850 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait, continue sorry. 171 00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.349 huda: No, no, that was awesome. 172 00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.259 Jenny Duan: What about like neural networks explaining how those work like Cs. 173 00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:02.100 huda: Oh, yeah, I think I think that might be applicable to math, maybe. But 174 00:28:02.534 --> 00:28:05.509 huda: I don't know about oh, yeah, science. 175 00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:32.296 Jenny Duan: I think maybe like that could be something if you're interested in doing like the math of current, like neural networks, and like deep learning versus like Rnns, and like other things documenting. But I think maybe if if the breakthrough challenge doesn't work out like always, there's the science and master scholarship, which is the cards against humanity, one which is anything stem in general, which I think it's like a more broad category. So like anything computer science could also fit in there. 176 00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.119 huda: Okay? Yeah. So I think. 177 00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.809 huda: maybe like I could. 178 00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:51.480 huda: I, I'm I'm okay with doing the one which is kind of related to math, because I'm a little bit more interested in that. But I I think the ones which is science specific. It's a bit difficult for me to like 179 00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.970 huda: doing that? Yeah. 180 00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:59.540 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So do you wanna still do the breakthrough challenge? Or do you wanna just skip it and focus on something different. 181 00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.369 huda: if it's if there's no. 182 00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.099 Jenny Duan: Sure I didn't go pressure either way. 183 00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.709 huda: Is it like? Is it fine? If I skip her, or is it gonna like kind of be detrimental to like. 184 00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:25.579 Jenny Duan: Nothing is detrimental. It's only an opportunity for more is how I view like everything like cause I mean not doing it is not gonna harm you in any way. It's just if you do it, and it goes well that has a potential. But to help you. But I mean it. 185 00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:42.430 Jenny Duan: Who knows? Right like whether or not something will happen? I think it's good to like do things for like the experience, and like, if it pays off. Then that's awesome. If not, then that's also, you know you did it for the learning experience. 186 00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.820 huda: Yeah. 187 00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.290 Jenny Duan: Yeah, does it sense. 188 00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:52.280 huda: Yeah, do a little bit more research, maybe, like, on a topic. And then I will get back to you. 189 00:29:53.220 --> 00:30:10.780 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So yeah, let me know if that if you find something interesting for you, if not like no big deal at all, they will just skip it, because, obviously, like, your time can be spent doing a million other things. You're a super busy person, so nothing nothing is going to like significantly harm you in any way. 190 00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.050 Jenny Duan: And okay. 191 00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:12.750 huda: Thank you. 192 00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:25.123 Jenny Duan: Cool. Yeah, of course. So let's just plan to do the Science Ambassador scholarship, for now and then we can move on from breakthrough for now then, 193 00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.280 Jenny Duan: okay. 194 00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.199 Jenny Duan: cool. So 195 00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.440 Jenny Duan: I'm curious, like, in terms of your letters of recommendations. 196 00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:41.969 Jenny Duan: How is that like going for school like in terms of college. When do you have to ask your English teacher? And also, when's your last day of school? 197 00:30:42.883 --> 00:30:45.950 huda: It's like the 28 I think of may. 198 00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:59.120 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So how's the how are you plan to ask your teachers for letters of recommendation? And do you plan to do that at the end of May or in the fall. I don't know what's the common practice at your school. 199 00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:13.999 huda: I think. I believe I'm gonna ask her during the end of may after like ap exams and also I think I look a good feeling about my English teacher, because 200 00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:21.560 huda: well, like we've been kind of connecting. And then she's been really liking my writing as well. And I told her about like 201 00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:35.973 huda: how she's kind of one of the reasons. So I got interested in journalism and like she really appreciated that. So I think it's like a good chance. But obviously like not fully secure. But I'm gonna ask her by the end of May and 202 00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:53.679 huda: usually, we just send out emails. So she actually had, like an assignment where we had to practice writing emails to like teachers and ask them to like write a letter of recommendation for us. So I could probably like send an email to her at the end, when, like, I guess. 203 00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.860 huda: everyone's going to. Yeah. 204 00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.640 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems awesome. So her. And then who else? 205 00:32:02.213 --> 00:32:03.020 huda: I think 206 00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.475 huda: probably 207 00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:19.650 huda: Maybe my Cs teacher. She yeah, she. I think she's like nominated me for a couple of words, and also just like she knows the them the most from all them. 208 00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.520 Jenny Duan: Awesome. So yeah, English and Cs seem like a good fit. And then are you also gonna ask her at the end of this year as well. 209 00:32:27.908 --> 00:32:33.649 huda: Yeah, probably I think she she usually forgets after like a long period of time. So maybe like. 210 00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.859 huda: I'll ask her by the end of May, and then like. 211 00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.350 huda: and then I'll remind her again next year. 212 00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:41.605 Jenny Duan: Great. 213 00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:54.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. I also wanted to just check in and see how publicity with Rishi is going. I think publicity is super, you know, important for spreading the impact of your activities. And I just want to check in to see how that is going for you. 214 00:32:55.889 --> 00:33:11.030 huda: Yeah, I think it's we have like a kind of a step. So I was posting the news. In the school news article and that was like all over Facebook and like Linkedin and like our school site and everything. So 215 00:33:12.121 --> 00:33:21.008 huda: there was that. And then we're reaching out again to the the Tracy news. Which is kind of like a neighboring city, and then 216 00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:38.219 huda: So he wants me to like. Kind of show up when you like. Search my name up so. I've been working on like new pages for like folklift and empowering AI where it's like a specific dedicated page. For like me, and like the other people working on it. 217 00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.600 huda: but yeah. And then 218 00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.770 huda: there's also 219 00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:53.059 huda: and then I think we're also trying to get like an article of mine out on like a New York I guess. Student piece 220 00:33:53.700 --> 00:34:01.658 huda: and then. We're just trying to get more articles written by me out there. There's also some sort of like la times, like 221 00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:14.299 huda: student program. I guess you just. But the only problem is you have to ask, like a teacher at to be like an advisor or something, and that usually doesn't work well in my school. 222 00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.910 huda: So yeah, I think 223 00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.239 huda: I've been looking for someone on that. And then 224 00:34:21.407 --> 00:34:23.230 huda: he's like, Oh. 225 00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:37.159 huda: I guess we're kind of planning out like like a description to write, because there's apparently like a specific like formula, like what you have to write for it to like appear in search results. So he's been helping me with that. But yeah. 226 00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:45.361 Jenny Duan: Got it cool. So I hope that that is able to pay off in the next couple of months. That seems really awesome. 227 00:34:46.058 --> 00:35:05.470 Jenny Duan: And yeah, I hope that that's working that will work out for you. I wanted to also go back to now, spending some time to think about awards again, especially like positioning yourself for scholarships for next year. I noticed that the group tape award applications are open again. Would you be interested in applying again for that. 228 00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.769 huda: Yeah, yeah, I think definitely. 229 00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:14.548 Jenny Duan: Okay, great that's do. May 30. First, is there an idea that you feel like you? 230 00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.149 Jenny Duan: you are interested in doing. 231 00:35:19.403 --> 00:35:25.929 huda: I think I don't think I wanna ask for a camera anymore. I'll probably ask for something like 232 00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.050 huda: maybe something like regarding 233 00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.696 huda: like Empire AI like maybe 234 00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:54.839 huda: like a tool that might make teaching easier. Like virtual teaching easier. 235 00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.320 huda: I'm not exactly sure I don't really have an idea right now. 236 00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.820 Jenny Duan: Is there like some software you want for your game, or something like that? 237 00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.030 huda: Oh, yeah, maybe I could get like 238 00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.420 huda: like sound design or some sort of like art program that might 239 00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.230 huda: help me improve my game. 240 00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:20.469 Jenny Duan: I feel like that would be really good. Yeah. I think that that seems like a good fit. 241 00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.410 Jenny Duan: yeah. 242 00:36:23.889 --> 00:36:28.219 Jenny Duan: Is there like, what's the specific names of the programs that you would want. 243 00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.590 huda: Maybe like fl studio 244 00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.850 huda: or 245 00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.889 huda: like for our maybe 246 00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.584 huda: like there's one called Ace, right? 247 00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.450 huda: but that's 248 00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:49.109 huda: I think. Group chip covers like $500 249 00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.900 huda: and 250 00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.361 huda: acepray and Fl, so you're kind of cheap, but 251 00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:10.529 Jenny Duan: Let's see, is there any like music production software like any like anything that you think you could get? Like, okay, to be honest, the $500 like, just write down what you need and like. If you don't spend the rest of the $500 you could kind of like, just keep it. 252 00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.089 Jenny Duan: But like you can, like 253 00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:16.629 Jenny Duan: like, get it like, use it towards like a computer, use it towards other things like. 254 00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:22.120 Jenny Duan: what do you think like, is it just justifiable expense, like either software or like. 255 00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:33.099 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like, if you want like a Dj set or something like that, like, I think you just need to write down a valid thing. And then once you get the funding, you could decide if you where you want to use that basically. 256 00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.380 huda: Yeah. 257 00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.467 huda: something like, maybe like an instrument or something like that. 258 00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.209 huda: like a guitar or something. 259 00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:45.130 Jenny Duan: How and how does that relate to what you want to do? 260 00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.079 Jenny Duan: Like a how's that unique? Isn't my question. 261 00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.910 huda: I think it's cause like the sound design of the game. 262 00:37:52.344 --> 00:37:59.090 huda: Like, it needs to be like a lot like improved a lot, and then like, I guess. 263 00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:08.160 huda: by having like sound effects created by the guitar, like they might be more like realistic or like help, since, like third better. I guess I don't know. 264 00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:17.000 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. That seems. That seems like a good idea. How would a physical? How would having a physical guitar help with that. 265 00:38:19.416 --> 00:38:23.380 huda: I mean, like the physical guitar can like record to 266 00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.380 huda: like make sounds for the game. 267 00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, is that necessary? Like, I feel like, that's kind of 268 00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.550 Jenny Duan: difficult. Just about getting a guitar just like for the game. 269 00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:39.950 Jenny Duan: Is there anything any way else that you could justify. Do you want to learn guitar? Because if you just want to learn guitar like. 270 00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.760 Jenny Duan: I think it's valid, just say that you want to learn guitar like. I don't think you necessarily need to say that you 271 00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:52.059 Jenny Duan: that you need a guitar for the game. You could just say, you want to learn guitar. If you just want to learn guitar. 272 00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.559 huda: I mean, yeah, I guess we're all in the guitar. 273 00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.450 Jenny Duan: Okay, then maybe you can do that instead. What do you think. 274 00:39:00.394 --> 00:39:02.940 huda: Do you think we'll be like unique enough to like? 275 00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.140 huda: Stand out. 276 00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.370 Jenny Duan: I think 277 00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.966 Jenny Duan: perhaps not. 278 00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:18.120 Jenny Duan: But maybe if you I think maybe depending on how you portray it. 279 00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.190 Jenny Duan: maybe if you say like 280 00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.049 Jenny Duan: if you say like, you want to learn guitar. So that 281 00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:28.910 Jenny Duan: like. 282 00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.670 Jenny Duan: is there an 283 00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.420 Jenny Duan: Indian classical guitar? I think that's an instrument right? 284 00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.680 huda: Oh, yeah. 285 00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.320 Jenny Duan: Would you be interested in learning that. 286 00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.670 huda: That'd be interesting. 287 00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:48.550 Jenny Duan: You can feel like you want to learn to connect, connect better with your culture like I think that's kind of cool. I think Indian classical guitar is like a cool instrument. 288 00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so we could play it. 289 00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.390 Jenny Duan: If that's something that you'd be interested in. 290 00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.360 huda: Yeah, I think that's that's definitely interesting. 291 00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.849 Jenny Duan: So maybe you could ask to try to get one of those. 292 00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:01.690 huda: Okay. 293 00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.800 huda: Yeah. 294 00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:08.310 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's actually pretty unique and interesting. So 295 00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.090 Jenny Duan: let's just go with that. Then 296 00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.170 Jenny Duan: cool. 297 00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.620 Jenny Duan: anything else. 298 00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:32.339 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like that's good. And then there's a ton a ton of ton of scholarships 299 00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:39.680 Jenny Duan: for next year for you. But so I kinda just wanted to like, spend some time going over the main ones. 300 00:40:40.234 --> 00:40:45.355 Jenny Duan: So within, just within cs, pretty much every single big company does a 301 00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.649 Jenny Duan: does a like scholarship program. For example, there are 302 00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.430 Jenny Duan: Microsoft, Google. 303 00:40:55.630 --> 00:41:04.210 Jenny Duan: there's I think, Intel, no Intel does one for for employees. Never mind. Microsoft, Google Amazon are the big ones. 304 00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.354 Jenny Duan: and I think that, like you'd be a really good candidate. 305 00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.280 Jenny Duan: for those. 306 00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.340 Jenny Duan: I think that they start taking applications in the fall. But 307 00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.189 Jenny Duan: before then, I think 308 00:41:16.655 --> 00:41:22.864 Jenny Duan: it's just good to do. I mean, keep working on what you're doing, and just continue on 309 00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:28.990 Jenny Duan: Continue on your track of like working on Cs building websites, building projects, etc. 310 00:41:29.593 --> 00:41:33.810 Jenny Duan: Another competition that I want to highlight is, have you ever made a podcast before Huda. 311 00:41:34.863 --> 00:41:37.059 huda: I haven't. But that sounds really interesting. 312 00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:48.330 Jenny Duan: There's a New York Times student podcast. Challenge, I think, could be interesting for you. Cause, I know the New York Times also sent essay, contest. But I feel like the essay contest is a bit over subscribed because of 313 00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.020 Jenny Duan: how many people submit to it? 314 00:41:51.030 --> 00:42:01.089 Jenny Duan: But I think that their podcast contest could be really unique and interesting. It's due May fifteenth, it's only 5 min or less, a podcast that could be entertaining or informative. 315 00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:05.499 Jenny Duan: So it could be like humorous, or it could be like, actually informative. 316 00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 317 00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.790 huda: Oh. 318 00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.379 huda: okay, that's interesting. 319 00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:18.689 huda: Maybe it could be like something like like a satire, podcast. Like poking fun at like the already existing podcast. People. 320 00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:25.700 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what do you think? What do you think you would wanna make a presentation about? 321 00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.826 huda: Yeah, I was thinking, like, maybe, like, 322 00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.105 huda: like, like, kind of like a satire, 323 00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:40.840 huda: kind of like mocking like, podcast, maybe you know how there's like the podcast, people that just kind of 324 00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.539 huda: like like Andrew Tate and stuff. 325 00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:53.449 huda: I'm just kind of like mocking them. Maybe like, I think not mocking them, but like like kind of highlighting, like what they're saying is wrong, like through satire. 326 00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. What kind of 327 00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:03.290 Jenny Duan: like can you tell me more? I'm I don't quite. I don't quite see that I don't quite understand that right now, but love to learn more. 328 00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.849 huda: Yeah. So like. 329 00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:10.530 huda: there's a lot of like Podcasters like Andrew Tate. And like other. 330 00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.989 Jenny Duan: Oh, I and I know I know Andrew Tate. 331 00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.363 huda: Yeah. 332 00:43:14.395 --> 00:43:14.680 Jenny Duan: Ellie. 333 00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.040 huda: Didn't save everything aside. 334 00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.650 Jenny Duan: Worcester. 335 00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:17.230 huda: Thanks. 336 00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I was scared, though I was becoming too much of like a boomer slash millennial to understand. 337 00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.941 Jenny Duan: But I'm glad I can still keep up. Okay, Andrew Tate. And 338 00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.779 Jenny Duan: yeah, continue. 339 00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:51.789 huda: Yeah, they so they say, like a lot of these like misogynistic. And like, you know, kind of, just like wrong, things on their podcast and like, just just to get views and stuff. And so like, I think, like kind of like, like, not exactly saying like misogynistic stuff. And I'm like Click, or whatever, but just like highlighting, maybe, like how like social media, just like a place for clickbait. Now. 340 00:43:52.222 --> 00:44:00.439 huda: do like a podcast might be like an interesting subject. Either that or like, just like interviewing someone. 341 00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.240 huda: maybe like like a. So 342 00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:12.289 huda: so the other idea could possibly be like interviewing like one of my classmates. I know New York Times isn't exactly like 343 00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:28.549 huda: oh, I don't know if it's like really like right to like talk about post theme on there, but like maybe like a pro Palestinian student, and like like, I know a few college students like maybe I could ask them about, like their experience with the encampment and everything. 344 00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.691 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems like a good idea. 345 00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.220 Jenny Duan: I would maybe avoid actually doing that, because I feel like that is a little too 346 00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:45.700 Jenny Duan: polarizing for like a contest. But I think that's something that if you're interested in, you could produce on your own, and I could help you like get that out to other sources, too. 347 00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.150 huda: Yeah. 348 00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.729 huda: also, I was kind of 349 00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.660 huda: thinking about like folklift, so like kind of 350 00:44:55.690 --> 00:45:06.770 huda: we've been posting a lot of like pro Palestinian like poetry, and like and also like the sheep letters. So I was wondering if, like 351 00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:12.130 huda: like not in the wrong way, but like, if we have to like, tone it down a little bit, because 352 00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.119 huda: obviously like, it's not like a really good environment to really like. 353 00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.700 huda: be super 354 00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.150 huda: a lot about that and so, like I was. 355 00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:28.169 Jenny Duan: No, I think you should be loud, Huna. I think you should be loud like. I think it's important that you are loud like. What's the concern about not being loud? 356 00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.280 Jenny Duan: Why not. 357 00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:34.549 huda: Well, a lot of schools and like admissions. 358 00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.059 huda: are not exactly like welcoming to propose the incidents 359 00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:44.229 huda: so like it kind of makes sense that, like they might not. 360 00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.700 huda: they might 361 00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:46.790 huda: kind of 362 00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:55.128 huda: block me out, I mean, like not block me out, but like kind of like blacklist me from like admission if I like, say too much about it, you know. 363 00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.690 Jenny Duan: I mean. 364 00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:04.959 Jenny Duan: you're just uplifting Palestinian voices. You are not condemning 365 00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:11.540 Jenny Duan: anyone else. You're not, I think. No, I I think they can't do like. I don't think they can do anything. 366 00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:20.160 Jenny Duan: I don't think they have any jurisdiction over what you do. I think what you're doing on full flip is really important, and I think, like, if this is meaningful to you, then you should continue doing it. 367 00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.789 huda: Alright. Yeah, that's great to hear. 368 00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:28.250 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And I also think that like hopefully, administration will show changes like 369 00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:37.319 Jenny Duan: cause. I think what they're doing with like shutting down. Student protests right now is just like terrible like, I think that's horrible. What they're doing. Like sending police to like the schools. 370 00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.120 huda: Yeah. 371 00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah. No. 372 00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.159 huda: And I think. 373 00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.110 Jenny Duan: Especially at Columbia, like. 374 00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:42.540 huda: That's. 375 00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.090 Jenny Duan: My friends there. I've been telling people like not to apply there. So 376 00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.529 Jenny Duan: that's kind of 377 00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:53.879 Jenny Duan: Columbia and Barnard like, it's just really sad. What's happening with their administration right now. Unfortunately. 378 00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.660 huda: Yeah. 379 00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:00.552 Jenny Duan: So. Yeah, no, I think you should continue doing full lift. I think only for the purposes of this essay 380 00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:10.379 Jenny Duan: I would say, not focus on like the essay contest. Maybe don't make that your focus. But for folk of yourself itself, I think like that's important and valuable. And you should. 381 00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.640 Jenny Duan: You should do that. 382 00:47:12.593 --> 00:47:13.620 huda: Okay, then. 383 00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:27.180 Jenny Duan: So today, we kind of just a recap. We covered a lot of things. We we went through all the updates congrats again on the final list. That's so amazing. I'm so happy for you. And we went over like some of the upcoming scholarships, and we went over like 384 00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:56.439 Jenny Duan: your Brian Cameron impact essays, which I hope to see next time we meet I hope to be able to make some more progress on that and then we also talked about like pro prepping for next year in terms of looking ahead, and also the breakthrough challenge which is the Khan Academy Prize and the Science Ambassador scholarship, which are both 2 min videos. And then the New York Times like this contest and grip tape which we're going to be working on soon. Let me just write some of those deadlines down so that you don't forget 385 00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.909 Jenny Duan: May 30. First. I think the biggest thing right now is the New York Times. 386 00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:08.480 Jenny Duan: Podcast challenge, which is due on May fifteenth. I think this is what 387 00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.549 Jenny Duan: you should prioritize 388 00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.410 Jenny Duan: and. 389 00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.920 huda: The the podcast thing or is it the 390 00:48:14.645 --> 00:48:16.429 huda: essay, like the open. 391 00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:19.079 Jenny Duan: It's a podcast 392 00:48:19.612 --> 00:48:22.080 Jenny Duan: when does the OP. Ed to actually. 393 00:48:23.042 --> 00:48:24.037 huda: I'm not sure. 394 00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.910 Jenny Duan: I don't know if it's like if it's if it's past 395 00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.770 Jenny Duan: I'd be passed. 396 00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:50.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah, the pod. The letter writing is passed. It was may first. 397 00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.720 Jenny Duan: but the podcast would be good to do. 398 00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:01.530 Jenny Duan: Okay. 399 00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.210 huda: I think there's a way to like. Still do it. I think. 400 00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.629 Jenny Duan: Tell me more. 401 00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.780 huda: There's like a like a link on their site, which shows, like 402 00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:21.799 huda: ready to share opinions. Get started here. 403 00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:31.240 Jenny Duan: It might be like, I don't know if it's worth submitting to that. If it says it's passed on the website because they might not accept your application, so I wouldn't want you to spend a lot of time. 404 00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.110 Jenny Duan: And it 405 00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.010 Jenny Duan: this one is all is from 2020, I think the link that you said. 406 00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:38.710 huda: All. 407 00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.070 Jenny Duan: According to the URL, I don't know.

How's it going. 2 00:08:29.988 --> 00:08:32.320 huda: Hi! Can you hear me? 3 00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.889 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I can hear you. 4 00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.429 huda: 1 s. Let me get my camera working. 5 00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:39.589 huda: Okay? Hello, I see. 6 00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.390 Jenny Duan: Hi! How's it going. 7 00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.637 huda: How it's going. Well, I haven't seen you in a while. 8 00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.509 Jenny Duan: I know long time. No see? Any updates. How's everything? 9 00:08:50.648 --> 00:09:05.102 huda: Yeah, I think it's been overall like pretty great these past few weeks. There's been like some good news like I got the games for change. Like. I think I got nominated as one of the finalists for the Game review. 10 00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.900 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh! Congratulations, Huna! That's so amazing! 11 00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:15.359 huda: Yeah, thank you so much. And then a few rejections as well. So the 12 00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.050 huda: the 13 00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.390 huda: the other Journalism conference. I forgot the name of it. That's the. 14 00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, more of like. 15 00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:22.810 huda: Yeah. 16 00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:23.900 Jenny Duan: In the clear. 17 00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:29.210 huda: Yeah, I got rejected from there. And then also, I think I 18 00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:35.789 huda: I didn't get I don't know if you remember what there's like the essay competition. It was like, yeah. 19 00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.388 huda: the make noise today. Thing. I didn't get that. But 20 00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:48.689 huda: Besides that I think I've had some progress with them, primarily like meeting plans and everything and also like 21 00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:02.770 huda: some progress and kind of s",
    "etting up our organization. Like, I establish new pages for the website. And I'm like we've been planning. So we've planned 3 different events. 22 00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.380 huda: So we're gonna be doing a like AR competition where, like. 23 00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:08.760 Jenny Duan: Oh! 24 00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:32.939 huda: Yeah, and our main motive for that is kind of to teach people like prompt engineering. And like, maybe if if they see any like biases when they're developing it. That's like kind of an option that they can tell us in the Google form. So yeah. And then we're also planning like a hackathon. But that's gonna be like during the summer. Because we do want like a lot of time to plan that 25 00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:59.841 huda: And then the hackathon. It's just gonna be like, I think it's gonna be more of like a broad like hackathon. But it's gonna be focused on like girls. So it's kind of the girls. Only hackathon and I feel like that could definitely grow reach, because, like a lot of people, just join hackathons. So she during the summer. And then another thing we're planning was our keynote speaker. 26 00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:08.089 huda: thing! I think we we haven't gone to do that yet. But, we're trying to do it. In the end of may 27 00:11:08.422 --> 00:11:18.059 huda: and then in between like, if we really do need to have more events, we can do something like with my game. Maybe like having like a showcase or something like that. 28 00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:32.970 huda: And yeah, that's about it for empowering. AI, I mean, I think maybe on the website, I did add like an our team page. So that way, like it could like kind of show up and search more and then 29 00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:59.940 huda: for folklift. I also don't think there's much progress on that. So I actually did like get someone to be, or or my vice President for that. She's like a freshman, I believe. At my school and she already made like an Instagram post for us. So like I think s",
    "he'd be really motivated to. And she agreed. So yeah, I think 30 00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.949 huda: I think folklit is going a little slower than empowering. Ag, but 31 00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.859 huda: yeah, 32 00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.240 huda: I think. 33 00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:18.307 huda: Oh, yeah. And then I think the professor or not, Professor, but like the teacher, I like one of the local high schools. He replied. Back to my email. 34 00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.490 Jenny Duan: Saw that. 35 00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.610 huda: Yeah. 36 00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.950 huda: it was really cool. 37 00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.230 huda: Yeah. 38 00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.549 Jenny Duan: Have you gotten any other responses since then? 39 00:12:27.144 --> 00:12:28.520 huda: No, just that one. 40 00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.330 huda: That's yeah. 41 00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.799 Jenny Duan: Just keep on sending it out. Hi! How many people do you think you've sent it out to so far? 42 00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.449 huda: I think like 43 00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.610 huda: around like 20. 44 00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.520 Jenny Duan: Okay, I want the number to be like 200. 45 00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.280 huda: Hmm. 46 00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.370 Jenny Duan: I think you need to scale it way more. And I think that will help. 47 00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.348 huda: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. 48 00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.540 huda: yeah. 49 00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:12.495 huda: And then also, I need to write a speech, for like, it's like an acceptance speech for the impact. Like, G forec, award. And so like, it's due on May eighth. But 50 00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:23.870 huda: it's basically like a video which is like 30 to 45 s long. And there's like a like a document that tells you like what to talk about. But yeah. 51 00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:32.809 Jenny Duan: That sounds really awesome. How's your progress with that going? And do you know anything about how many finalists ad",
    "vance to the winning stage, and just how that process works. 52 00:13:33.992 --> 00:13:39.920 huda: I believe my dad was doing a little research. And I think, he said, it's like the top 53 00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.330 huda: 5 are top 10 out of like a hundred submissions. 54 00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.900 huda: Yeah. 55 00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.539 Jenny Duan: Our finalists are our winners. 56 00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.689 huda: Finalists. I think there's only one winner. 57 00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.540 Jenny Duan: Okay. 58 00:13:50.960 --> 00:14:13.259 Jenny Duan: that's super exciting, though, like, regardless of whether or not you become a winner like you are already super impressive as a finalist, and know to know that you, your essay, has been submitted. Subs. Has been selected, sorry out of so many is, is already super impressive, and, like that, is already in a national ward, and of itself so congrats on your second national award like that's huge and so exciting. 59 00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.329 huda: Thank you. 60 00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:23.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So do you have any progress on your acceptance speech so far? Or are you just gonna like wing it? Or how? How do you plan to go about doing that? 61 00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:35.550 huda: I think, this weekend. I'm gonna draft like, maybe a speech of like what I'm gonna say, and we'll record it as well, because, you know, like next week is ap testing, it's kind of gonna ramp up from here. But yeah. 62 00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.399 Jenny Duan: I also meant to ask you how is setting for the Ap's going. 63 00:14:40.136 --> 00:14:49.959 huda: I'd say it's going pretty well, I mean, like my Apcs test is on Tuesday, just really soon. So I think there's gonna be a lot of priming this weekend. 64 00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.550 Jenny Duan: I guess it's gonna be fine for you, though, right like I do. 65 00:14:52.550 --> 00:15:05.909 huda: Yeah, there's a few things that I just like, I don't understand. Like",
    ", yeah. But yeah, I don't think I should. I need to study for that one the book. But my, a push test is this Friday. 66 00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:33.533 huda: and that was like kind of one of my more tough ones, and then next week I have ap calc and Ap Ling like back to back. So that's also kind of bad. But I think our preparation for that is going pretty well, especially I think. Ap Ling. I've been consistently getting like nineties or 95 s. On my essay. So. I think my teachers kind of like it's a good indicator of how I'm going to do on like the exam. 67 00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:58.301 huda: And then for calculus we have, like we had our finals. This week. Actually. So it was just like a mock Ap exam, so it's like, our like, our Mcq. With calculator. Non calculator, and then also the Frq's. And everything. So it's like exactly like the Ap. Exam. So I think I did. Well, I'm not sure how I did. But yeah, 68 00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.970 huda: so yeah, I'm hoping that will help me with the Ap. Soon as well. 69 00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:10.507 Jenny Duan: Super cool. Well, I'm sure your Ap's will be fine. I don't think you have too much to worry about, and like also Ap's 70 00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:23.339 Jenny Duan: like in the grand scheme of things. They're also relatively inconsequential to be honest, like, if if you don't get a score you want, you just don't have to report the score on your college application, and that's fine. But obviously it's good to get fives. But 71 00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.790 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay. 72 00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:35.950 Jenny Duan: The next thing I wanted to check in with you. Let's see, have we gone through all of your extra curricular is what else are you gonna say, Apple engineering camp? When do you hear about that? Did they say anything. 73 00:16:36.678 --> 00:16:42.650 huda: They said. They'll let us know in May. But yeah, like, I don't think they give a specific date. 74 00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, what about",
    " any of the wait lists like Nhs. Ga. 75 00:16:49.202 --> 00:16:52.100 huda: I haven't got an update from them, either. 76 00:16:52.458 --> 00:17:02.650 huda: But I was also wondering like, should I email them and let them know about like becoming like a finalist for for the games, for change, like, I think that might 77 00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.109 huda: makes my application stronger. So 78 00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:07.099 huda: yeah. 79 00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:13.799 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's actually a really good idea. So you'd like to provide an update. And yeah, that seems good. 80 00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:20.019 Jenny Duan: receive, am I missing anything else? 81 00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.499 Jenny Duan: Oh, really. 82 00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:47.209 Jenny Duan: okay. So the things that are kind of top of mind for me right now are talking about your camera impact scholarship and then talking about some of the other competitions like the video making ones like breakthrough Kona. That's the Khan Academy one the science and master scholarship, etc. So maybe let's just start with the camera impact. I'm wondering, like, have you been able to make any progress on that front? And how's that going. 83 00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:57.646 huda: Honestly, I haven't had like any progress. On those esses. I I kind of feel like I'm having like a tough time like writing about the Esses, because 84 00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.779 huda: I feel like 85 00:18:00.223 --> 00:18:04.046 huda: I don't know. Just like the prompts are like a little bit tough to. 86 00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.389 Jenny Duan: Like super. There's no, they're super tough. Yeah. 87 00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:07.920 huda: Yeah. 88 00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:16.320 Jenny Duan: I feel you for sure. Do you? Do you maybe wanna help brainstorm? Is it the brainstorming? Or where are you getting stuck? Do you think. 89 00:18:17.184 --> 00:18:42.209 huda: I feel like I'm just. I might be like at least, for, like the essay was like t",
    "he one location would change you. I feel like I'm not focusing on the right thing like I'm kind of trying to tell story, but it might. I might be like going too much in detail, like describing location and like I don't know. Like if I'm portraying the story correctly, because so I'm I'm writing about Starting valley. And I'm talking about like 90 00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:54.640 huda: I guess how the character has to choose between like like supporting the community or like growing economically about it. I cannot having trouble like relating that to myself. 91 00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:56.740 huda: Because, like 92 00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.230 huda: obviously, I guess. 93 00:18:59.968 --> 00:19:06.680 huda: it could relate to like folklift. But at the same time I feel like a lot of the other essays. We brainstorm to be about folklift. 94 00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.020 huda: So yeah, I'm not sure that would work. 95 00:19:10.995 --> 00:19:14.240 Jenny Duan: I think. Like, if you just talk about 96 00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:20.849 Jenny Duan: what's what's one of your big, extra curriculars that you still haven't mentioned in your essay. Also, I'm gonna get on that doc right now. 97 00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.919 Jenny Duan: So we can talk about that. 98 00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.340 Jenny Duan: Are there any of like your extracurriculars that you feel like you haven't gotten the chance to mention yet? 99 00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:34.312 huda: I don't think I ever talk about like 100 00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.530 huda: like being a news anchor, I guess. 101 00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.230 huda: But 102 00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.940 huda: yeah, I feel like that also doesn't relate to the story. But 103 00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.940 huda: maybe. 104 00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.562 Jenny Duan: Maybe if you want to talk about full clift here, where else do you write about? Full Clift? 105 00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.490 Jenny Duan: The leadership 106 00:19:54.910 --> 00:20:01.009 Jenny Duan",
    ": leadership? Maybe you can talk about like spreading your voice and bring that one about journalism instead. 107 00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.120 Jenny Duan: What do you think. 108 00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.300 huda: So more about like becoming like a news anchor for for school. 109 00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.085 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 110 00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.579 huda: Okay, yeah, that sounds good 111 00:20:14.183 --> 00:20:17.299 huda: like, when I said, Brian Cameron essays do. By the way. 112 00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.640 Jenny Duan: I think later this month 113 00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.850 Jenny Duan: let me check where I go. 114 00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.289 Jenny Duan: It's due Wednesday, May 20, s. 115 00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.505 huda: Okay. 116 00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.520 Jenny Duan: At noon Pacific time, not 1159. 117 00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.379 huda: Okay, I could probably get it by then. I think I'll especially like after. 118 00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.030 huda: If he exams, I'll be able to like solely work on it and 119 00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:01.052 huda: like, get a lot of it done. But yeah, I think I should start working on this. 120 00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.100 huda: yeah. 121 00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:14.249 Jenny Duan: Sounds good to me. Do you have any other? Are there any other places in this application that you feel stuck about in the essays that maybe we can work and talk through right now. 122 00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.440 huda: like. 123 00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.833 huda: maybe like 124 00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.670 huda: How I can bring up this 125 00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:33.739 huda: is is Number 5, like the Se. Number 5. Is this supposed to be kind of like, turn into a story. It's talking about 126 00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:39.610 huda: on like which schools you want to go to and like, what area of study do you wanna pursue? There. 127 00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:48.570 Jenny Duan: I think this one. You can just write straightforward like, I do",
    "n't think you need to write a story. You can just say, like, okay, I'm planning to go to this place, this place, this place. And why? 128 00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.730 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 129 00:21:50.010 --> 00:22:06.212 huda: Okay? And then number 6. I know we said games for change about like like what career? We envision, or I envision myself for myself. So here like, should I talk about 130 00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.220 huda: kind of how I got into game development or like? 131 00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.970 huda: Why, I'm interested in game development mainly. 132 00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:33.750 Jenny Duan: I think, why you're interested in game development and why game development might be an overlooked or important way for you to impact like public service and public change cause. I think this scholarship is primarily like public service focused a lot. So like, talk about how games for change connects to the public good and like. Why, this is super impactful and important. 133 00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.020 huda: Okay. 134 00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.229 huda: thank you.

Which one did we say? 138 00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.820 huda: We were gonna like, how was I? Gonna connect this again. 139 00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.579 Jenny Duan: Tell us about a location? What was what is your question? What is your question about? Number 12? 140 00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.669 huda: It says, tell us about a location, real or fictional. That has. 141 00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.250 huda: Oh, do you mean the essay. 142 00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.149 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like you, said Number 12, you you had a question about it. 143 00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.690 Jenny Duan: If I have, Chris. 144 00:23:30.228 --> 00:23:40.079 huda: I was wondering like. So I know, I said, start you valley, but I kind of forgot, like how I'm suppos",
    "ed to like connect it to like my own extracurricular 145 00:23:40.437 --> 00:23:43.219 huda: and I think I think you said folklift 146 00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.530 huda: so so like 147 00:23:45.760 --> 00:24:08.159 huda: in the story the character has to choose between, like the kind of ambitious like opportunities. And then the community center so like how can I create like a contrast between that between like folklift. I guess it's just for, like my community with something else, because that's a compared to something else. Like the characters to make decision. 148 00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.780 huda: So like I'm kind of deciding 149 00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:21.788 huda: like. Do you think I can be like oh, instead of just like grabbing like a leadership position and Msa, or like something like that, or 150 00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.350 huda: like. I don't know exactly what to compare it to. 151 00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.201 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like you can compare it to 152 00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.259 Jenny Duan: like within your community how you're able to. First of all, like 153 00:24:36.460 --> 00:25:01.289 Jenny Duan: move beyond, like you can just make a broad generalization about yourself. But then, after that, you can talk about how like going back and looking at your town like this is not so. This is not something to like. Be hide. It's something that you're proud of, and something you want to help. Other people be proud of, too. And that's why you started full flip to like uplift businesses in your area that you know, connect to your background that also, like uplift, the the wellbeing of the 154 00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:06.180 Jenny Duan: not villagers, but like the community members in mountain House. 155 00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:19.379 Jenny Duan: So like, maybe you can say that like what initially you wanted to change. But you ultimately decided that it's better to like, build community and to like find strength in empowering other people through l",
    "ike your work. 156 00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.450 Jenny Duan: The swell. 157 00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.280 huda: That makes sense. 158 00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.690 huda: Yeah, I could probably be able to integrate that in. 159 00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.439 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool sounds good. 160 00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:59.730 Jenny Duan: Any other questions about Brian Cameron? I know that this has been like kind of a struggle for a while, and I know that this is a really hard set of questions. And that's also kind of what one reason why I wanted you to do it is regardless of whether or not you actually win this award like going and practicing these questions will be really really good, because it'll help you so much just thinking about just for thinking about your college applications in general. But do you have any other questions regarding this essay or any other in this application? 161 00:26:00.449 --> 00:26:03.089 huda: No, I think that's it for Brian Cameron. 162 00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:14.809 Jenny Duan: Okay, wonderful. I think. Now, let's spend some time thinking about the the breakthrough challenge, which is the Khan Academy one. Do you have any updates on that front 163 00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.700 Jenny Duan: on your topic. 164 00:26:17.473 --> 00:26:29.286 huda: Not exactly. But also I was like I was kind of wondering, since this challenge is kind of like unrelated from the matrix that I've been looking at. So 165 00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:40.299 huda: like, is it kind of necessary to do something that's like science or math related? On going into like kind of like media studies, or like interactive media. 166 00:26:41.360 --> 00:27:05.790 Jenny Duan: I think it's it connects because it's an opportunity to do science communication. So like, I think your game is a very distinct form of science communication, too, like kind of taking a complicated concept like AI like anything else and using interactive media. So a video, a game, etc. to explain it. So that'",
    "s why I think it's a good fit for you. Because also it's video making, because it gives you an opportunity to make a video about something. 167 00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:27.879 Jenny Duan: but also it's like a pretty cool scholarship, and it's a big award. But I think, like if if you think it's too technical, or if you feel like you don't want to do it because of that aspect that's like also fine. We could also just move on. It's just kind of out there. I think it could be a good fit, but it depends on like, obviously you have to do it. So whatever you feel like, it's best. 168 00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:45.437 huda: Yeah, I I think I I definitely be interested. But my only issue is that I feel like, I don't really like have enough like interest, and either like math or science like, have a specific topic that I want to talk about, and also, like 169 00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.660 Jenny Duan: You don't want to do it. 170 00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.850 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait, continue sorry. 171 00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.349 huda: No, no, that was awesome. 172 00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.259 Jenny Duan: What about like neural networks explaining how those work like Cs. 173 00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:02.100 huda: Oh, yeah, I think I think that might be applicable to math, maybe. But 174 00:28:02.534 --> 00:28:05.509 huda: I don't know about oh, yeah, science. 175 00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:32.296 Jenny Duan: I think maybe like that could be something if you're interested in doing like the math of current, like neural networks, and like deep learning versus like Rnns, and like other things documenting. But I think maybe if if the breakthrough challenge doesn't work out like always, there's the science and master scholarship, which is the cards against humanity, one which is anything stem in general, which I think it's like a more broad category. So like anything computer science could also fit in there. 176 00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.119 huda: Okay? Yeah. So I think. 177 00:28:36.170 --> 00",
    ":28:37.809 huda: maybe like I could. 178 00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:51.480 huda: I, I'm I'm okay with doing the one which is kind of related to math, because I'm a little bit more interested in that. But I I think the ones which is science specific. It's a bit difficult for me to like 179 00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.970 huda: doing that? Yeah. 180 00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:59.540 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So do you wanna still do the breakthrough challenge? Or do you wanna just skip it and focus on something different. 181 00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.369 huda: if it's if there's no. 182 00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.099 Jenny Duan: Sure I didn't go pressure either way. 183 00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.709 huda: Is it like? Is it fine? If I skip her, or is it gonna like kind of be detrimental to like. 184 00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:25.579 Jenny Duan: Nothing is detrimental. It's only an opportunity for more is how I view like everything like cause I mean not doing it is not gonna harm you in any way. It's just if you do it, and it goes well that has a potential. But to help you. But I mean it. 185 00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:42.430 Jenny Duan: Who knows? Right like whether or not something will happen? I think it's good to like do things for like the experience, and like, if it pays off. Then that's awesome. If not, then that's also, you know you did it for the learning experience. 186 00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.820 huda: Yeah. 187 00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.290 Jenny Duan: Yeah, does it sense. 188 00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:52.280 huda: Yeah, do a little bit more research, maybe, like, on a topic. And then I will get back to you. 189 00:29:53.220 --> 00:30:10.780 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So yeah, let me know if that if you find something interesting for you, if not like no big deal at all, they will just skip it, because, obviously, like, your time can be spent doing a million other things. You're a super busy person, so nothing nothing is going to like significantly harm you in any way. 190 00:30:11.",
    "500 --> 00:30:12.050 Jenny Duan: And okay. 191 00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:12.750 huda: Thank you. 192 00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:25.123 Jenny Duan: Cool. Yeah, of course. So let's just plan to do the Science Ambassador scholarship, for now and then we can move on from breakthrough for now then, 193 00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.280 Jenny Duan: okay. 194 00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.199 Jenny Duan: cool. So 195 00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.440 Jenny Duan: I'm curious, like, in terms of your letters of recommendations. 196 00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:41.969 Jenny Duan: How is that like going for school like in terms of college. When do you have to ask your English teacher? And also, when's your last day of school? 197 00:30:42.883 --> 00:30:45.950 huda: It's like the 28 I think of may. 198 00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:59.120 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So how's the how are you plan to ask your teachers for letters of recommendation? And do you plan to do that at the end of May or in the fall. I don't know what's the common practice at your school. 199 00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:13.999 huda: I think. I believe I'm gonna ask her during the end of may after like ap exams and also I think I look a good feeling about my English teacher, because 200 00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:21.560 huda: well, like we've been kind of connecting. And then she's been really liking my writing as well. And I told her about like 201 00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:35.973 huda: how she's kind of one of the reasons. So I got interested in journalism and like she really appreciated that. So I think it's like a good chance. But obviously like not fully secure. But I'm gonna ask her by the end of May and 202 00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:53.679 huda: usually, we just send out emails. So she actually had, like an assignment where we had to practice writing emails to like teachers and ask them to like write a letter of recommendation for us. So I could probably like send an email to her at the end, when, like, I guess. 203 00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.860 huda",
    ": everyone's going to. Yeah. 204 00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.640 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems awesome. So her. And then who else? 205 00:32:02.213 --> 00:32:03.020 huda: I think 206 00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.475 huda: probably 207 00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:19.650 huda: Maybe my Cs teacher. She yeah, she. I think she's like nominated me for a couple of words, and also just like she knows the them the most from all them. 208 00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.520 Jenny Duan: Awesome. So yeah, English and Cs seem like a good fit. And then are you also gonna ask her at the end of this year as well. 209 00:32:27.908 --> 00:32:33.649 huda: Yeah, probably I think she she usually forgets after like a long period of time. So maybe like. 210 00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.859 huda: I'll ask her by the end of May, and then like. 211 00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.350 huda: and then I'll remind her again next year. 212 00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:41.605 Jenny Duan: Great. 213 00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:54.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. I also wanted to just check in and see how publicity with Rishi is going. I think publicity is super, you know, important for spreading the impact of your activities. And I just want to check in to see how that is going for you. 214 00:32:55.889 --> 00:33:11.030 huda: Yeah, I think it's we have like a kind of a step. So I was posting the news. In the school news article and that was like all over Facebook and like Linkedin and like our school site and everything. So 215 00:33:12.121 --> 00:33:21.008 huda: there was that. And then we're reaching out again to the the Tracy news. Which is kind of like a neighboring city, and then 216 00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:38.219 huda: So he wants me to like. Kind of show up when you like. Search my name up so. I've been working on like new pages for like folklift and empowering AI where it's like a specific dedicated page. For like me, and like the other people working on it. 217 00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.600 huda: but yeah. And then 218 00:33:40.860 --> 0",
    "0:33:42.770 huda: there's also 219 00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:53.059 huda: and then I think we're also trying to get like an article of mine out on like a New York I guess. Student piece 220 00:33:53.700 --> 00:34:01.658 huda: and then. We're just trying to get more articles written by me out there. There's also some sort of like la times, like 221 00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:14.299 huda: student program. I guess you just. But the only problem is you have to ask, like a teacher at to be like an advisor or something, and that usually doesn't work well in my school. 222 00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.910 huda: So yeah, I think 223 00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.239 huda: I've been looking for someone on that. And then 224 00:34:21.407 --> 00:34:23.230 huda: he's like, Oh. 225 00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:37.159 huda: I guess we're kind of planning out like like a description to write, because there's apparently like a specific like formula, like what you have to write for it to like appear in search results. So he's been helping me with that. But yeah. 226 00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:45.361 Jenny Duan: Got it cool. So I hope that that is able to pay off in the next couple of months. That seems really awesome. 227 00:34:46.058 --> 00:35:05.470 Jenny Duan: And yeah, I hope that that's working that will work out for you. I wanted to also go back to now, spending some time to think about awards again, especially like positioning yourself for scholarships for next year. I noticed that the group tape award applications are open again. Would you be interested in applying again for that. 228 00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.769 huda: Yeah, yeah, I think definitely. 229 00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:14.548 Jenny Duan: Okay, great that's do. May 30. First, is there an idea that you feel like you? 230 00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.149 Jenny Duan: you are interested in doing. 231 00:35:19.403 --> 00:35:25.929 huda: I think I don't think I wanna ask for a camera anymore. I'll probably ask for something like 232 00:35:35.870 -->",
    " 00:35:38.050 huda: maybe something like regarding 233 00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.696 huda: like Empire AI like maybe 234 00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:54.839 huda: like a tool that might make teaching easier. Like virtual teaching easier. 235 00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.320 huda: I'm not exactly sure I don't really have an idea right now. 236 00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.820 Jenny Duan: Is there like some software you want for your game, or something like that? 237 00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.030 huda: Oh, yeah, maybe I could get like 238 00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.420 huda: like sound design or some sort of like art program that might 239 00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.230 huda: help me improve my game. 240 00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:20.469 Jenny Duan: I feel like that would be really good. Yeah. I think that that seems like a good fit. 241 00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.410 Jenny Duan: yeah. 242 00:36:23.889 --> 00:36:28.219 Jenny Duan: Is there like, what's the specific names of the programs that you would want. 243 00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.590 huda: Maybe like fl studio 244 00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.850 huda: or 245 00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.889 huda: like for our maybe 246 00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.584 huda: like there's one called Ace, right? 247 00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.450 huda: but that's 248 00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:49.109 huda: I think. Group chip covers like $500 249 00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.900 huda: and 250 00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.361 huda: acepray and Fl, so you're kind of cheap, but 251 00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:10.529 Jenny Duan: Let's see, is there any like music production software like any like anything that you think you could get? Like, okay, to be honest, the $500 like, just write down what you need and like. If you don't spend the rest of the $500 you could kind of like, just keep it. 252 00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.089 Jenny Duan: But like you can, like 253 00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:16.629 Jenny Duan: like, get it like, use it towards like a computer, use it towards other th",
    "ings like. 254 00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:22.120 Jenny Duan: what do you think like, is it just justifiable expense, like either software or like. 255 00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:33.099 Jenny Duan: I don't know. Like, if you want like a Dj set or something like that, like, I think you just need to write down a valid thing. And then once you get the funding, you could decide if you where you want to use that basically. 256 00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.380 huda: Yeah. 257 00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.467 huda: something like, maybe like an instrument or something like that. 258 00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.209 huda: like a guitar or something. 259 00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:45.130 Jenny Duan: How and how does that relate to what you want to do? 260 00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.079 Jenny Duan: Like a how's that unique? Isn't my question. 261 00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.910 huda: I think it's cause like the sound design of the game. 262 00:37:52.344 --> 00:37:59.090 huda: Like, it needs to be like a lot like improved a lot, and then like, I guess. 263 00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:08.160 huda: by having like sound effects created by the guitar, like they might be more like realistic or like help, since, like third better. I guess I don't know. 264 00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:17.000 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. That seems. That seems like a good idea. How would a physical? How would having a physical guitar help with that. 265 00:38:19.416 --> 00:38:23.380 huda: I mean, like the physical guitar can like record to 266 00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.380 huda: like make sounds for the game. 267 00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, is that necessary? Like, I feel like, that's kind of 268 00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.550 Jenny Duan: difficult. Just about getting a guitar just like for the game. 269 00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:39.950 Jenny Duan: Is there anything any way else that you could justify. Do you want to learn guitar? Because if you just want to learn guitar like. 270 00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.760 Jenny Duan: I ",
    "think it's valid, just say that you want to learn guitar like. I don't think you necessarily need to say that you 271 00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:52.059 Jenny Duan: that you need a guitar for the game. You could just say, you want to learn guitar. If you just want to learn guitar. 272 00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.559 huda: I mean, yeah, I guess we're all in the guitar. 273 00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.450 Jenny Duan: Okay, then maybe you can do that instead. What do you think. 274 00:39:00.394 --> 00:39:02.940 huda: Do you think we'll be like unique enough to like? 275 00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.140 huda: Stand out. 276 00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.370 Jenny Duan: I think 277 00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.966 Jenny Duan: perhaps not. 278 00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:18.120 Jenny Duan: But maybe if you I think maybe depending on how you portray it. 279 00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.190 Jenny Duan: maybe if you say like 280 00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.049 Jenny Duan: if you say like, you want to learn guitar. So that 281 00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:28.910 Jenny Duan: like. 282 00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.670 Jenny Duan: is there an 283 00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.420 Jenny Duan: Indian classical guitar? I think that's an instrument right? 284 00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.680 huda: Oh, yeah. 285 00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.320 Jenny Duan: Would you be interested in learning that. 286 00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.670 huda: That'd be interesting. 287 00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:48.550 Jenny Duan: You can feel like you want to learn to connect, connect better with your culture like I think that's kind of cool. I think Indian classical guitar is like a cool instrument. 288 00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so we could play it. 289 00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.390 Jenny Duan: If that's something that you'd be interested in. 290 00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.360 huda: Yeah, I think that's that's definitely interesting. 291 00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.849 Jenny Duan: So maybe you could ask to try to get one of those. 292 0",
    "0:40:01.020 --> 00:40:01.690 huda: Okay. 293 00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.800 huda: Yeah. 294 00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:08.310 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's actually pretty unique and interesting. So 295 00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.090 Jenny Duan: let's just go with that. Then 296 00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.170 Jenny Duan: cool. 297 00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.620 Jenny Duan: anything else. 298 00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:32.339 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like that's good. And then there's a ton a ton of ton of scholarships 299 00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:39.680 Jenny Duan: for next year for you. But so I kinda just wanted to like, spend some time going over the main ones. 300 00:40:40.234 --> 00:40:45.355 Jenny Duan: So within, just within cs, pretty much every single big company does a 301 00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.649 Jenny Duan: does a like scholarship program. For example, there are 302 00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.430 Jenny Duan: Microsoft, Google. 303 00:40:55.630 --> 00:41:04.210 Jenny Duan: there's I think, Intel, no Intel does one for for employees. Never mind. Microsoft, Google Amazon are the big ones. 304 00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.354 Jenny Duan: and I think that, like you'd be a really good candidate. 305 00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.280 Jenny Duan: for those. 306 00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.340 Jenny Duan: I think that they start taking applications in the fall. But 307 00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.189 Jenny Duan: before then, I think 308 00:41:16.655 --> 00:41:22.864 Jenny Duan: it's just good to do. I mean, keep working on what you're doing, and just continue on 309 00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:28.990 Jenny Duan: Continue on your track of like working on Cs building websites, building projects, etc. 310 00:41:29.593 --> 00:41:33.810 Jenny Duan: Another competition that I want to highlight is, have you ever made a podcast before Huda. 311 00:41:34.863 --> 00:41:37.059 huda: I haven't. But that sounds really interesting. 312 00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:48.330 Jenny Duan: There's",
    " a New York Times student podcast. Challenge, I think, could be interesting for you. Cause, I know the New York Times also sent essay, contest. But I feel like the essay contest is a bit over subscribed because of 313 00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.020 Jenny Duan: how many people submit to it? 314 00:41:51.030 --> 00:42:01.089 Jenny Duan: But I think that their podcast contest could be really unique and interesting. It's due May fifteenth, it's only 5 min or less, a podcast that could be entertaining or informative. 315 00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:05.499 Jenny Duan: So it could be like humorous, or it could be like, actually informative. 316 00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 317 00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.790 huda: Oh. 318 00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.379 huda: okay, that's interesting. 319 00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:18.689 huda: Maybe it could be like something like like a satire, podcast. Like poking fun at like the already existing podcast. People. 320 00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:25.700 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what do you think? What do you think you would wanna make a presentation about? 321 00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.826 huda: Yeah, I was thinking, like, maybe, like, 322 00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.105 huda: like, like, kind of like a satire, 323 00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:40.840 huda: kind of like mocking like, podcast, maybe you know how there's like the podcast, people that just kind of 324 00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.539 huda: like like Andrew Tate and stuff. 325 00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:53.449 huda: I'm just kind of like mocking them. Maybe like, I think not mocking them, but like like kind of highlighting, like what they're saying is wrong, like through satire. 326 00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah. What kind of 327 00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:03.290 Jenny Duan: like can you tell me more? I'm I don't quite. I don't quite see that I don't quite understand that right now, but love to learn more. 328 00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.849 huda: Yeah. So like. 329 00:43:04.860 --",
    "> 00:43:10.530 huda: there's a lot of like Podcasters like Andrew Tate. And like other. 330 00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.989 Jenny Duan: Oh, I and I know I know Andrew Tate. 331 00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.363 huda: Yeah. 332 00:43:14.395 --> 00:43:14.680 Jenny Duan: Ellie. 333 00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.040 huda: Didn't save everything aside. 334 00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.650 Jenny Duan: Worcester. 335 00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:17.230 huda: Thanks. 336 00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.360 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I was scared, though I was becoming too much of like a boomer slash millennial to understand. 337 00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.941 Jenny Duan: But I'm glad I can still keep up. Okay, Andrew Tate. And 338 00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.779 Jenny Duan: yeah, continue. 339 00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:51.789 huda: Yeah, they so they say, like a lot of these like misogynistic. And like, you know, kind of, just like wrong, things on their podcast and like, just just to get views and stuff. And so like, I think, like kind of like, like, not exactly saying like misogynistic stuff. And I'm like Click, or whatever, but just like highlighting, maybe, like how like social media, just like a place for clickbait. Now. 340 00:43:52.222 --> 00:44:00.439 huda: do like a podcast might be like an interesting subject. Either that or like, just like interviewing someone. 341 00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.240 huda: maybe like like a. So 342 00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:12.289 huda: so the other idea could possibly be like interviewing like one of my classmates. I know New York Times isn't exactly like 343 00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:28.549 huda: oh, I don't know if it's like really like right to like talk about post theme on there, but like maybe like a pro Palestinian student, and like like, I know a few college students like maybe I could ask them about, like their experience with the encampment and everything. 344 00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.691 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems like a good idea. 345 00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.220 J",
    "enny Duan: I would maybe avoid actually doing that, because I feel like that is a little too 346 00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:45.700 Jenny Duan: polarizing for like a contest. But I think that's something that if you're interested in, you could produce on your own, and I could help you like get that out to other sources, too. 347 00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.150 huda: Yeah. 348 00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.729 huda: also, I was kind of 349 00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.660 huda: thinking about like folklift, so like kind of 350 00:44:55.690 --> 00:45:06.770 huda: we've been posting a lot of like pro Palestinian like poetry, and like and also like the sheep letters. So I was wondering if, like 351 00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:12.130 huda: like not in the wrong way, but like, if we have to like, tone it down a little bit, because 352 00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.119 huda: obviously like, it's not like a really good environment to really like. 353 00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.700 huda: be super 354 00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.150 huda: a lot about that and so, like I was. 355 00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:28.169 Jenny Duan: No, I think you should be loud, Huna. I think you should be loud like. I think it's important that you are loud like. What's the concern about not being loud? 356 00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.280 Jenny Duan: Why not. 357 00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:34.549 huda: Well, a lot of schools and like admissions. 358 00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.059 huda: are not exactly like welcoming to propose the incidents 359 00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:44.229 huda: so like it kind of makes sense that, like they might not. 360 00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.700 huda: they might 361 00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:46.790 huda: kind of 362 00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:55.128 huda: block me out, I mean, like not block me out, but like kind of like blacklist me from like admission if I like, say too much about it, you know. 363 00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.690 Jenny Duan: I mean. 364 00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:04.959 Jenny Duan: you're just uplifting P",
    "alestinian voices. You are not condemning 365 00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:11.540 Jenny Duan: anyone else. You're not, I think. No, I I think they can't do like. I don't think they can do anything. 366 00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:20.160 Jenny Duan: I don't think they have any jurisdiction over what you do. I think what you're doing on full flip is really important, and I think, like, if this is meaningful to you, then you should continue doing it. 367 00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.789 huda: Alright. Yeah, that's great to hear. 368 00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:28.250 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And I also think that like hopefully, administration will show changes like 369 00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:37.319 Jenny Duan: cause. I think what they're doing with like shutting down. Student protests right now is just like terrible like, I think that's horrible. What they're doing. Like sending police to like the schools. 370 00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.120 huda: Yeah. 371 00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah. No. 372 00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.159 huda: And I think. 373 00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.110 Jenny Duan: Especially at Columbia, like. 374 00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:42.540 huda: That's. 375 00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.090 Jenny Duan: My friends there. I've been telling people like not to apply there. So 376 00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.529 Jenny Duan: that's kind of 377 00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:53.879 Jenny Duan: Columbia and Barnard like, it's just really sad. What's happening with their administration right now. Unfortunately. 378 00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.660 huda: Yeah. 379 00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:00.552 Jenny Duan: So. Yeah, no, I think you should continue doing full lift. I think only for the purposes of this essay 380 00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:10.379 Jenny Duan: I would say, not focus on like the essay contest. Maybe don't make that your focus. But for folk of yourself itself, I think like that's important and valuable. And you should. 381 00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.640 Jenny Duan: You should do that. 382",
    " 00:47:12.593 --> 00:47:13.620 huda: Okay, then. 383 00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:27.180 Jenny Duan: So today, we kind of just a recap. We covered a lot of things. We we went through all the updates congrats again on the final list. That's so amazing. I'm so happy for you. And we went over like some of the upcoming scholarships, and we went over like 384 00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:56.439 Jenny Duan: your Brian Cameron impact essays, which I hope to see next time we meet I hope to be able to make some more progress on that and then we also talked about like pro prepping for next year in terms of looking ahead, and also the breakthrough challenge which is the Khan Academy Prize and the Science Ambassador scholarship, which are both 2 min videos. And then the New York Times like this contest and grip tape which we're going to be working on soon. Let me just write some of those deadlines down so that you don't forget 385 00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.909 Jenny Duan: May 30. First. I think the biggest thing right now is the New York Times. 386 00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:08.480 Jenny Duan: Podcast challenge, which is due on May fifteenth. I think this is what 387 00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.549 Jenny Duan: you should prioritize 388 00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.410 Jenny Duan: and. 389 00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.920 huda: The the podcast thing or is it the 390 00:48:14.645 --> 00:48:16.429 huda: essay, like the open. 391 00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:19.079 Jenny Duan: It's a podcast 392 00:48:19.612 --> 00:48:22.080 Jenny Duan: when does the OP. Ed to actually. 393 00:48:23.042 --> 00:48:24.037 huda: I'm not sure. 394 00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.910 Jenny Duan: I don't know if it's like if it's if it's past 395 00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.770 Jenny Duan: I'd be passed. 396 00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:50.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah, the pod. The letter writing is passed. It was may first. 397 00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.720 Jenny Duan: but the podcast would be good to do. 398 00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:01.530 Jenny Duan: Oka",
    "y. 399 00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.210 huda: I think there's a way to like. Still do it.

Get started here. 403 00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:31.240 Jenny Duan: It might be like, I don't know if it's worth submitting to that. If it says it's passed on the website because they might not accept your application, so I wouldn't want you to spend a lot of time. 404 00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.110 Jenny Duan: And it 405 00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.010 Jenny Duan: this one is all is from 2020, I think the link that you said. 406 00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:38.710 huda: All. 407 00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.070 Jenny Duan: According to the URL, I don't know.
