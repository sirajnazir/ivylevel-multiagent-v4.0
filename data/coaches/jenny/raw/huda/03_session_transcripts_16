How are you? 2 00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:26.159 Jenny Duan: How about doing? Well, has it been super hot for you guys today? Turn it off. 3 00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:35.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely. Heat wave, right? Not crazy. It's like October, and it's still hot, some for some reason. 4 00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:50.510 huda: Yes. How's everything going? Oh, sorry. Yeah, I took like a bunch of practice tests. And I was actually able to get 1490 like, 2 times 5 00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:13.369 huda: and I'm pretty happy about that. But I think I should definitely like improve. But other than that, this break I've just kind of been focusing more on on like catching up with school work and also setting for the sat I haven't done much for, like the other things. I mean, we've selected our new officers on film makers club. But 6 00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.840 huda: I think. 7 00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.920 huda: yeah, I didn't make much progress on the other things. 8 00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.360 huda: I guess. Yeah, we are setting up a meeting today to talk about like our updates with empowering. AI. So 9 00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:41.289 Jenny Duan: yeah, that's awesome. Give me 1 s. Let me just reconnect my earpods. I'm getting a little bit of lag. It's on my end. Just let me reconnect 10 00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.170 Jenny Duan: right? 11 00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, can you say something? 12 00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.030 huda: Yeah. So for empowering AI, we just set up a meeting to right after this call. So 13 00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:07.510 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. Well, I think definitely like the looking at your should be the priority. Because I think that's like obviously the most 14 00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:24.770 Jenny Duan: that's coming up the quickest, right? So I'm happy that your scores consistent. I do think that we can get up. How is you? Give me that breakdown like? Which might be? Is that? What is that between them? 15 00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.750 huda: 7, 20 on reading, and then And then 16 00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.180 huda: 7, 7, 70 on that. So 17 00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.920 Jenny Duan: okay, that's really interesting, because that's been a huge jump in the map since we last talk. But what happened to the reading section 18 00:02:47.960 --> 00:03:11.220 huda: I'm not sure cause like I think, the passages that I've gotten they've like they've started like the ones that I've been doing. The language is kinda like throws me off. And then sometimes like, especially for the ones where there's like 2 passages like in one. I kinda get confused because it's like old, like historical language, and like sometimes like, I can't really understand like their views. 19 00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.189 Like the ones that I did before. They're kind of straightforward, but and then like for math, I think so there's like this 20 00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:34.930 huda: So I think we talked about this before. But one like on the calculator, you can set up like different, like apps, or programs. And then I've been using that. And that's like, really help me with the calculator section and then, honestly, just like. 21 00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:51.869 huda: like I think my main issue back then was like I didn't know about like mode meeting and mean and all that. So like I kind of focused on er my week areas. And I was able to like improve my score like, immensely. So yeah. 22 00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.020 huda: I think you're muted. 23 00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:08.939 Jenny Duan: Thanks for catching that. Sorry, I said. That's really good to hear. And I'm like really happy about your math progress, because that's the huge jump. I think that you know, if we can get the math 24 00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:38.170 Jenny Duan: to as close to perfect as possible, and then also the reading. Get the meeting a little bit higher, like back to the range that you were before, like around the 7, 77 50 range, you should be in a really good spot. So I think let's start with talking about the paired passages, because I think that's one area of Sd, where we can like, do some really targeted improvements. So would you share your screen? And just like taking to the test number most recent tests, and I can walk you through some like specific targeted strategies for paired passages. 25 00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.150 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me stop sharing. 26 00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.760 huda: Okay, 27 00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.250 huda: is. 28 00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:15.180 Jenny Duan: take your time. One question I do have for you, though, is, do you feel like 29 00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:44.089 huda: the area that you focus more on to feel like you just do better because I feel like before. Right? You said like you weren't focusing as much on math. And then you suddenly, I'm sure, like focused more. And then your answers go a lot better. But like, stop focusing a little bit on reading because you were prioritizing math more. But you say that's the case or not really I think so, cause I feel like it's kind of easier to like study for math cause. There's like concepts I need to work on. But for like reading. It's like, kind of you have to do practice. And like. 30 00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:53.950 Jenny Duan: I think that's like from the practice test. I need to like kinda focus more on this. So let me find, like like specific passage 31 00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:22.430 Jenny Duan: cause I feel like a lot of your performance that I've noticed has to do with your mindset, and how you approach the text, because I feel like, you know before, when you were focused on the reading section and like maybe not, focus as much on that you were able to do really well. And then, when you focus on that, you're able to do really well again. But I think what you need is to just focus on both. Like, treat every single section, every single problem as its own individual battle. Like every passage you're like, okay, I need to get this 100 every math problem. You should be thinking like, Okay, this is the 32 00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:45.470 Jenny Duan: like. You should treat every single question as if it were the only one that mattered like when you're doing it at the time. Because I think you know, being in the Zone for every question. Obviously, you're able to perform well, like you've demonstrated that you can do the reading writing section with minimal errors. You can do the math section with minimal errors. You just need to put yourself into that mindset every time you're doing like every single one of the questions that should be like the only one that matters when you're doing it? 33 00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:55.469 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay. So for parent passages, can you generally walk me through how you approach them like, just you see it? And what's what goes through your mind. 34 00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:17.779 huda: Yeah. So first, I kinda like go down to the questions. And II like try to answer like these these type of questions. First I just go back, and I quickly answer them. Before I would read this all in like one. Go, and then like, answer the questions. But lately. I think it helps me with time to just kinda read like the questions that I can answer right away, like, for example, like this one like 35 00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:43.389 huda: the use of the phrase, and I'd go back and just try to do that like, try to find where it is. And then, after that like when it starts asking you like their opinions on each other, and like what the main purpose whatever is. I'll go back and like just start reading the whole thing. Yeah. And then, like, actually, I'd I'd read the first passage and then like, answer any questions for the first passage, and then, usually, like 36 00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.940 huda: most of them, are just comparing like the relationship. So then I have to read the whole thing. 37 00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:57.720 huda: and then do you usually get the ones like the vocabulary questions. Do you forget this wrong, or do you usually get those right? I think the the ones that I get right? 38 00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:23.320 Jenny Duan: So you can join that first. But the thing about pair passage? What's really unique about the answer section is that like the first 3 to 5 questions, for usually it's about 3 to 4 questions will correspond to the first passage, and then there will be like 2 questions that correspond to the second passage, and then some questions talking about the relationships in between. So what you can do with the pair passages is you can 39 00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:35.710 Jenny Duan: treat the first 3 to 4 questions like its own separate passage. Only read the first passage, then do the first 3 to 4, then read the second passage, then do the rest, and if you do it like that sometimes it's 40 00:08:35.740 --> 00:09:00.729 Jenny Duan: easy to get confused with passage like you might mistake the content. The second passage for the content in the first passage, and vice versa. But if you do that so first only read the first passage, then answer the questions that pertain to the first passage. I'll usually be 3 to 4, sometimes 5, and then read the second passage, and then to the second passage questions, and then do the rest. I think doing it that way will help you versus reading both of them, and then trying to answer in that recall, because that's really hard. 41 00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.810 Jenny Duan: So 42 00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:31.029 Jenny Duan: why don't we just look at these questions like, do you see how the first 4 or 5 questions basically only correspond to passage one as a pair of passengers. Yeah, so that's yeah. So that's one strategy that you can use. So why don't we just pull up an extra sat do you have any copies of like additional messages that you haven't done ready. If you don't, I can always share my screen, too. I think it just. It's easier if you have about your screen. 43 00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.849 huda: I can get the the ones from the sat practice website. 44 00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:43.440 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Yeah. Just pull up anyone that you haven't done. And we can. Just we'll just only do the passage section there. 45 00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.530 Jenny Duan: Yep. 46 00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.500 huda: like. 47 00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.599 huda: I think. Also the science ones also kind of trip me up a bit. 48 00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.170 huda: yeah, like. 49 00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.049 huda: I think this is the period. 50 00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.479 huda: Oh, you know, this is not okay. 51 00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.300 huda: Listen. 52 00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:10.810 Jenny Duan: Okay. So why don't we talk about that strategy? Oh, the other thing that's important for you to read is the title. So start by reading the title, because I can often give you a lot of information. 53 00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:16.669 Jenny Duan: So passage one is adapted from this passage 2 is adapted from this. 54 00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.700 so 55 00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.640 Jenny Duan: this kind of tells you the subject and the relationship 56 00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:50.309 Jenny Duan: so based on this, you might see that, like the first one is published by NASA, the second one is published by Society for Science in the Galaxy, and then the first one is saying that free floating planets might be more common than stars, and then the second one, saying, like fewer big road planets from the galaxy. So that kind of tells you like, maybe they're adding onto each other. Maybe they're contrasting each other. But you don't know until you read. So 57 00:11:50.460 --> 00:12:00.909 Jenny Duan: let's start by reading the first passage and then doing the questions for the first passage. So why don't you just only read the passage one, and then we can take a look at the questions together after that. 58 00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.210 huda: should I read it out loud? Or 59 00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.700 huda: if you want to, you don't have to, though. 60 00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.900 Jenny Duan: because I can also read it on your screen. So if you want to read out loud, but you don't have to. Okay. 61 00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.320 huda: Okay, I could have feeding it 62 00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:00.319 Jenny Duan: alright cool. So now, before you look at the questions, can you tell me what this passage is about in like one sentence? 63 00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.479 huda: So they're basically saying like 64 00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:19.100 huda: that if planets were like made similar to stars, and they'd be like, basically produced like, not as frequently, but the planets are like very evident. There's like a lot of them. 65 00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.929 Jenny Duan: Exactly. So now let's look at the questions. 66 00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.390 Jenny Duan: Okay? 67 00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:48.930 Jenny Duan: Question one, do the results of the survey described in passage one. Just support the conclusion that there are twice as many Jupiter mass free floating planets as Earth mass ones, so you might have to look back and look at the results of the survey. So let's see, in the third paragraph, there's talking about the survey right? We sampled a portion can overall. Okay. 68 00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:08.420 Jenny Duan: they are thought to be more common than free floating. Jupiter's. Okay. But now let's look back at the question. does this suggest that this is, support the conclusion that there are twice as many. So what is the answer? 69 00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.420 Jenny Duan: I'd say yes, and then 70 00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:24.160 huda: yes, because the survey actively estimates 71 00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.790 huda: the number of free floating planets in the galaxy. 72 00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.209 Jenny Duan: Okay. And why don't you go back and confirm? 73 00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.679 Jenny Duan: You know. 74 00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.550 Jenny Duan: what does this say? 75 00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.980 huda: They are more common than free, floating Jupiter's. 76 00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.029 Jenny Duan: What are more common? 77 00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:52.369 huda: planets smaller than Jupiter and Saturn? 78 00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.589 huda: Oh, wait, and it's like. 79 00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.349 huda: are more are thought to be more common than free flowing Jupiter. 80 00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.910 Jenny Duan: And what does the question say? 81 00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:16.490 huda: they're twice as many. Oh, okay, so it would be the opposite. Actually. 82 00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:26.630 huda: so no, because the survey shows that there are more earth mass free floating plants than Judomas ones. 83 00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.879 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So does that make sense? I think it's just. 84 00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:41.690 Jenny Duan: yeah. I think, for these type. It's type of questions. It's kind of confusing, because the passage is like 85 00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.970 huda: kind of jump between topics. And then it's like hard for me to keep up. But 86 00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.549 Jenny Duan: right. But does this make sense to you now? 87 00:16:52.730 --> 00:17:12.959 Jenny Duan: I think it's just like, be every single question like you should have a direct correspondence to the passage about where it talks about whatever the topic is. So you should be able to find, like a direct paragraph or direct sentence that gives you the answer you're looking for. So that should be so it should be like, clear what the answer is, just from when you look at it. 88 00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.780 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's look at the next question. 89 00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:23.430 Jenny Duan: And okay, now, you can see like they're looking for the exact line. So what is the exact line. 90 00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:34.990 Jenny Duan: It's the as a result, right? Or you can do it. Yeah, correct. 91 00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.859 Jenny Duan: And then to get the next question. 92 00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.409 Jenny Duan: okay? So now you can say, according to passage to. So now you need to read the whole passage too. 93 00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:57.509 Jenny Duan: So this one, there's only 2 questions that correspond to passage one. But now we know for sure, like now you know for sure the ones you got about passage one. You know that those are correct because your brain is not confused with the material open passage 2, 94 00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.669 Jenny Duan: that's what we do 95 00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:44.219 Jenny Duan: 1,820 96 00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.220 Jenny Duan: and 97 00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.210 good morning 98 00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.230 Jenny Duan: that port. we're doing, that. I will 99 00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.150 thank you. 100 00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.310 huda: okay. 101 00:19:49.430 --> 00:20:11.579 huda: So basically, it was like about, I was talking about like this new method that they found to measure like how many big planets there are and then apparently like it, it conflicted like an earlier like hypothesis that there's like, many like Jupiter sized planets. 102 00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.969 huda: or I think. 103 00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.460 Jenny Duan: yeah, go ahead. 104 00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.009 huda: ye yeah. And then 105 00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.029 huda: But then they found that like 106 00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:37.840 huda: the smaller ones, like the earth's mass or heavier, are like most of the rogues, and, like the lighters, are like 107 00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:45.999 huda: they're kind of tossed out and like ejected not like the ones that are heavier, like Earth. 108 00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:53.699 Jenny Duan: exactly so based on that. What is the answer to the question for that? 109 00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.120 And again, you should be able to go back and find, like a specific line where it talks about that. 110 00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.420 huda: Hmm! 111 00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.490 huda: I'd say. And 112 00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.170 huda: a 113 00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.480 Jenny Duan: or actually and then. 114 00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.560 Jenny Duan: Oh. 115 00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:27.830 Jenny Duan: go ahead. I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna tell you what the correct answer is until you find the line. 116 00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:41.119 huda: Okay, cause d could be it because determine how many big which are caused by a rogue planet 117 00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.429 huda: for every typical star called mean sequence, or, sir. 118 00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:54.730 huda: because they looked at this many micro lensing events. and they tried to determine which were caused by a real planet. 119 00:21:55.170 --> 00:22:04.620 Jenny Duan: exactly. That's correct. 120 00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.390 Jenny Duan: Okay? I see. Yeah. 121 00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.050 huda: okay, that was like, cause at first I thought. 122 00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.380 huda: a, because 123 00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.260 huda: it. It's kind of mentioned over here. And then, yeah. 124 00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:24.259 Jenny Duan: but it says the new results sharply. Contrast, doesn't it? 125 00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.649 huda: So I think it would be the yeah. 126 00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.530 Jenny Duan: Correct. Yeah. 127 00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.060 huda: 7, 8. 128 00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.980 huda: Nice. 129 00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.050 Jenny Duan: So not about 46. 130 00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.569 huda: Make account for 132 00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.080 huda: Who identify 133 00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.790 Jenny Duan: and 134 00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.110 Jenny Duan: correct? Yeah. 135 00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.510 Jenny Duan: 47. 136 00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:17.409 Jenny Duan: The 6 paragraphs. So now you need to look back at 6 pair back. And what does it serve as? Look at the options first? 137 00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.040 huda: where? 138 00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.440 huda: So right 139 00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.320 huda: day for? 140 00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.740 huda: But okay. 141 00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.169 huda: would it be? C, 142 00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.440 Jenny Duan: okay, can you explain why? 143 00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.149 huda: Okay. So 144 00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:35.219 huda: it talks about a recent fine recent findings to an explanation of how might reflect on previous findings. And then. So over here it talks about like the Co. Author of the 2,011, study 145 00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:47.390 huda: the new census fail to find evidence for a large population. So, however, the new data, and then, like the new claim, so like the data does reveal this. 146 00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.340 huda: so it's like a new hypothesis, I guess. 147 00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:59.830 huda: Oh. yeah. But it's not really like criticism. So it won't be that one. 148 00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.109 Jenny Duan: Okay, so what about C, 149 00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:25.889 huda: yes, see? I think, is the correct answer, because it kinda talks about like what they found in the find in their findings. And then, like kinda how it's like different from the the past ones. 150 00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.810 Jenny Duan: Oh, thank you. 151 00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.890 Jenny Duan: that's correct. 152 00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:38.700 Jenny Duan: And then 48. Is there a question? 48. Another vocabulary? 153 00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.920 huda: I'd say, D, 154 00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.419 Jenny Duan: we have live 155 00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:13.589 huda: because, although these are like kind of main like definitions of giving up. I think 156 00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:25.689 huda: in 59 II had to read back one more sentence, and kind of talks about it being like a magnifying glass, and it like focuses the light so we could infer that giving up 157 00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:31.440 huda: wouldn't hide or anything. It would show the planet's existence 158 00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.120 Jenny Duan: character. 159 00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.190 Jenny Duan: And then. 160 00:26:36.380 --> 00:27:03.890 Jenny Duan: so you're doing really? Well, here, I feel like you're getting all these. Okay. And now now we have the questions talking about the relationship between the both of them. Right? So what would you just say is the like relationship between passage one passage to in your own words. First. I'd say, like they talk about 2 different like, I guess. Wait. When was the first one from? Let me check? 161 00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:11.870 huda: okay, so this is the 2011 study. I think that they're talking about. 162 00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:42.820 Jenny Duan: okay? So like, I guess, the second passage is kind of counter, claiming the first one and I'd say, like, giving a different perspective on like an evidence on why, it wouldn't be the it would. The first claim isn't correct. 163 00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.819 Jenny Duan: And so based on what you said, given the answer to this is below, which one does that align the most with 164 00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:10.550 Jenny Duan: I'd say. 165 00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.550 huda: a 166 00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.260 okay. And 167 00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:24.409 Jenny Duan: can you re explain why? Now, given the context of the 2 paragraphs or the 2 passages? That's correct. By the way. 168 00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:47.939 huda: okay, thank you. So the so I would say, kind of like, process of elimination as well cause I know that they didn't agree, so wouldn't be C, and then B, it doesn't make sense, cause they didn't talk about a different field of study or like it didn't extend it using the micro lensing, but it kinda like contradicted it. 169 00:28:47.970 --> 00:29:06.830 huda: So that wouldn't be an viable option as well. And then d it's not really talk about variables, cause there isn't like a specific like reason why they got different results. I think it's just they disagree. So then looking back on a I'd say that. 170 00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:17.299 huda: this, like the study in passage 2 challenges the results. Because also, the first passage doesn't really give a specific study with like results. 171 00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:29.109 huda: Or actually it does. But yeah. But I'd say, like, it challenges the results. And it doesn't extend or support or like identify variables that are not in this. In the first one. 172 00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.870 Jenny Duan: great Jack. 173 00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:46.540 Jenny Duan: okay? And then finally 50. Now that they're asking for planning to screen them between the 2 passages. And so why don't we look at the answer, please? And we can the answer options. And we can do process of elimination to find like. 174 00:29:46.580 --> 00:30:01.890 Jenny Duan: which do the pass which point to the passages most clearly disagree? Yes, so I think it wouldn't be one cause or a, because everyone knows that there are pre floating Jupiter mass limits. 175 00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:18.630 huda: I'd say, for okay, I'm thinking now, B, because, like C, it doesn't really talk about in the first passage, and then d 176 00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:33.569 huda: like. That's not really what their main argument is like. That's just something that they add in. But so their main argument, I think B is the best option, because, the main focus is about the amount of free floating Jupiter mass minutes. There are. 177 00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 178 00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah. See? That wasn't so painful. Right? Like you did that. 179 00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:53.489 Jenny Duan: So I think, going off of that framework of kind of like a sandwich, where, like you look at the first one really questions corresponding to the first one, look at the second one, look at the questions corresponding to both, and then 180 00:30:53.490 --> 00:31:17.099 Jenny Duan: do the do it like that? I feel like that's a good way for you to approach this type of question. And then other general strategies for the reading section are to really look for evidence. So every single question should correspond to like a piece of evidence. Okay? Graphic sentence in the rest of the passage, and looking for that direct and specific point, should give you clues as to what the answer is looking for. 181 00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:37.129 Jenny Duan: Second thing is for the historical passages. I know the language is hard. I think those you just kinda have to power it through, not get distracted. Do you have a watch that you're using when you're taking the test. No. But I use like like I asked my Google home to like, set up a timer for the amount of time. 182 00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:59.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, I would get some type of physical watch or timer. You're not allowed to have like smart watches. If you can't have an apple watch, but if you have a dock and watch, or if you can borrow one from somewhere, or if you have like, a little desk timer that can't connect to the Internet. You can use that, and that will help you time your passages. You can spend about 10 to 12 min per passage. So, having that type of timer. 183 00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.690 Jenny Duan: I will tell you like how much time you have left, and like how 184 00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:13.100 Jenny Duan: you're doing in terms of like progress on the exam as long as it is not connected to the Internet. 185 00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.930 Jenny Duan: Okay. 186 00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:43.179 Jenny Duan: yeah. So like, just a normal watch, a normal like little desk, tiny clock something like that. It's not too big, and it can't make any noise, and it can't connect to the Internet. If you watch beeps you have to turn it off. Can't make any noise just because that distracts other people, because sometimes, if you're in a big room because I don't know where you're taking the test, but depending on where you're taking, might not be able to see the clock. So that's thing about like having a timer. 187 00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:51.260 Jenny Duan: It's helpful for that reason that makes sense. Yeah, any other questions. 188 00:32:51.290 --> 00:33:03.309 huda: Maybe we could talk about like my like the signs, passages? I think. Let me go to the questions, the ones where I got a bunch wrong? Okay. 189 00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:28.420 huda: yeah. This one. This is the passage, the science passage that are struggling with. 190 00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.040 huda: what's specifically doable? I think. 191 00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:41.779 Jenny Duan: This evidence like, I got the question right. But the evidence is wrong for some reason. And 192 00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:53.020 huda: like, okay, these type of questions are kind of challenging, like the main focus shifts from and then like, I don't really know how to find. Oh, you know this is 193 00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.960 Jenny Duan: not related. Okay, wait. 194 00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.810 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 195 00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.720 Jenny Duan: little more. 196 00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:15.880 Jenny Duan: Let's go 197 00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:35.090 Jenny Duan: this question specifically, yeah, this one. Okay, so are you. Do you get tripped up on the tables, or are they helpful for you? Sometimes like it depends on the topic. But this time I was kind of stumped with these 2 questions. 198 00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.859 Jenny Duan: Okay, 19 and 20, Umhm. 199 00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.799 Jenny Duan: Okay, so based on table one. So first, you need to know what the 200 00:34:43.830 --> 00:35:11.079 Jenny Duan: authors also, I do have to go like in a couple of minutes, so I won't go through the rest of the passage. But I can definitely talk about these 2 questions, and if you have other questions, you can text me. And like, I'll respond later, is that okay? Okay? So based on table one, how would the authors explain their observation. So what is their observation? First, we need to know that. Can you describe what their observation is requesting? 201 00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:23.229 huda: yeah. So I think they're kind of talking about how 202 00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:41.260 huda: like learning about how impact can. Yeah. So like, you know how like companies, they'll have like vision statements. I think, basically, this one is talk about like how 203 00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:54.489 huda: mission statements aren't really helpful to employees cause they keep hearing that they're worked as impactful but they don't feel like it, cause they have like a bunch of these mundane tasks to do. 204 00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.170 huda: yeah. And then 205 00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.399 Jenny Duan: yeah. So that's like, kind of the observation. 206 00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:13.070 Jenny Duan: okay. And then let's look at the 207 00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.099 Jenny Duan: back to the graph. Right? 208 00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.300 Jenny Duan: And so 209 00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.450 Jenny Duan: can I see the question one more time. 210 00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:30.740 Jenny Duan: And that is the data for portent task. Okay. 211 00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.820 Jenny Duan: important. 212 00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:38.099 Jenny Duan: So let's look at the data for portion tasks across all condition groups. So 213 00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.310 Jenny Duan: okay, important tasks. How 214 00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:48.669 Jenny Duan: meaningful they found it more meaningful. Right? So 215 00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:54.909 Jenny Duan: now we go back to the question. So now we know those 2 pieces, what the passions says, and what the 216 00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:00.739 Jenny Duan: So what do you think? The answer is based on what you know now? 217 00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:19.160 Jenny Duan: So you're looking for some like a reason why the data justifies the author's points right? 218 00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.349 Jenny Duan: And can you summarize what you think? The author's points are again. 219 00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:36.559 Jenny Duan: So they think that purpose farming, which is like just having tell them their work is impactful. that isn't as useful as subordinate farming. 220 00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:37.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. 221 00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:47.350 Jenny Duan: and why would why would meaning? Why would personal task be more meaningful. Explain that 222 00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:55.289 huda: it will be more meaningful because it makes them feel like they're not just doing the mending task. And that 223 00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.969 huda: Oh, would it be a 224 00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.550 Jenny Duan: yeah, exactly right. 225 00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.510 huda: Does that make sense? Why, yeah, I put 226 00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.290 the arena I put. 227 00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:11.199 huda: yeah, be for this one for some reason. But 228 00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:20.409 Jenny Duan: but I guess just walking through that. Does that make more sense to you? Now? Cool, awesome. So now let's look at the second question. Right? 229 00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:32.250 Jenny Duan: So taking the other to 2 tables. Best support which statement. so we already know what the first tables is saying, cause we already looked at it, and the second. Now let's look at the second table. 230 00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:46.250 Jenny Duan: So the design table is showing that important tasks are perceived to be more meaningful across all types of frames. Right? They're more enjoyable. So now we know that 231 00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:53.600 Jenny Duan: important tasks, both more enjoyable and more meaningful. So now let's look back at the answer options 232 00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.520 right? 233 00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.750 Jenny Duan: And 234 00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.540 Jenny Duan: and so 235 00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:08.060 Jenny Duan: what do you think? The correct answer is. it's 236 00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:20.799 Jenny Duan: I think it would be. I think it could be be 237 00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:34.850 Jenny Duan: yeah, why? So the reason I think it's speed, because you can see there and table, too, that, like the numbers here, they're like a lot more different than these values. 238 00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:59.469 Jenny Duan: Like er no these guys are really different. In comparison. Same could be said for this 1 3.8 to 4.8. Exactly. So. Do you see how like they close? The graphs will just lead you to the answer. So what you can do if you're 239 00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:23.479 Jenny Duan: confused by questions like this. Look at the graph, and check whether or not to answer. See? The question corresponds to the answer on the graph, and just like check each and every school one of them, until you find the correct answer. It would be a little time consuming, but like there should be one that is definitely correct. There should be definitely wrong. That makes sense. Yeah. Cool. Any other questions. 240 00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:31.689 huda: Do you have any like general tips for me like in preparing for like the test in a few days. 241 00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:45.799 Jenny Duan: I think. Just watch your mindset, and make sure you treat every single one as like every single question as important. I think that's like the main thing that you can do. So 242 00:40:45.800 --> 00:41:09.929 Jenny Duan: other than that. I mean just obviously more repetition. If you know that you need bars, practice with signs, passages, then just look at you know the bonus stuff that you have, and like specifically this, I can pass it into those questions. Like, you don't have to do an entire reading section one sign section on one history section. Yeah, does that make sense. 243 00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.639 Jenny Duan: Cool. 244 00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:22.659 Jenny Duan: Yeah, of course, good luck. And technically, you need anything else before that. Yeah, of course. Thank you.",

How are you? 2 00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:26.159 Jenny Duan: How about doing? Well, has it been super hot for you guys today? Turn it off. 3 00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:35.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, definitely. Heat wave, right? Not crazy. It's like October, and it's still hot, some for some reason. 4 00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:50.510 huda: Yes. How's everything going? Oh, sorry. Yeah, I took like a bunch of practice tests. And I was actually able to get 1490 like, 2 times 5 00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:13.369 huda: and I'm pretty happy about that. But I think I should definitely like improve. But other than that, this break I've just kind of been focusing more on on like catching up with school work and also setting for the sat I haven't done much for, like the other things. I mean, we've selected our new officers on film makers club. But 6 00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.840 huda: I think. 7 00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.920 huda: yeah, I didn't make much progress on the other things. 8 00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.360 huda: I guess. Yeah, we are setting up a meeting today to talk about like our updates with empowering. AI. So 9 00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:41.289 Jenny Duan: yeah, that's awesome. Give me 1 s. Let me just reconnect my earpods. I'm getting a little bit of lag. It's on my end. Just let me reconnect 10 00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.170 Jenny Duan: right? 11 00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, can you say something? 12 00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.030 huda: Yeah. So for empowering AI, we just set up a meeting to right after this call. So 13 00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:07.510 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. Well, I think definitely like the looking at your should be the priority. Because I think that's like obviously the most 14 00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:24.770 Jenny Duan: that's coming up the quickest, right? So I'm happy that your sco",
    "res consistent. I do think that we can get up. How is you? Give me that breakdown like? Which might be? Is that? What is that between them? 15 00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.750 huda: 7, 20 on reading, and then And then 16 00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.180 huda: 7, 7, 70 on that. So 17 00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.920 Jenny Duan: okay, that's really interesting, because that's been a huge jump in the map since we last talk. But what happened to the reading section 18 00:02:47.960 --> 00:03:11.220 huda: I'm not sure cause like I think, the passages that I've gotten they've like they've started like the ones that I've been doing. The language is kinda like throws me off. And then sometimes like, especially for the ones where there's like 2 passages like in one. I kinda get confused because it's like old, like historical language, and like sometimes like, I can't really understand like their views. 19 00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.189 Like the ones that I did before. They're kind of straightforward, but and then like for math, I think so there's like this 20 00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:34.930 huda: So I think we talked about this before. But one like on the calculator, you can set up like different, like apps, or programs. And then I've been using that. And that's like, really help me with the calculator section and then, honestly, just like. 21 00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:51.869 huda: like I think my main issue back then was like I didn't know about like mode meeting and mean and all that. So like I kind of focused on er my week areas. And I was able to like improve my score like, immensely. So yeah. 22 00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.020 huda: I think you're muted. 23 00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:08.939 Jenny Duan: Thanks for catching that. Sorry, I said. That's really good to hear. And I'm like really happy about your math progress, because that's the huge jump. I think that you know, if we can get the math 24 00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:38.170 Jenny Duan: to as close to perfect as possible, and then also th",
    "e reading. Get the meeting a little bit higher, like back to the range that you were before, like around the 7, 77 50 range, you should be in a really good spot. So I think let's start with talking about the paired passages, because I think that's one area of Sd, where we can like, do some really targeted improvements. So would you share your screen? And just like taking to the test number most recent tests, and I can walk you through some like specific targeted strategies for paired passages. 25 00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.150 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me stop sharing. 26 00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.760 huda: Okay, 27 00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.250 huda: is. 28 00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:15.180 Jenny Duan: take your time. One question I do have for you, though, is, do you feel like 29 00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:44.089 huda: the area that you focus more on to feel like you just do better because I feel like before. Right? You said like you weren't focusing as much on math. And then you suddenly, I'm sure, like focused more. And then your answers go a lot better. But like, stop focusing a little bit on reading because you were prioritizing math more. But you say that's the case or not really I think so, cause I feel like it's kind of easier to like study for math cause. There's like concepts I need to work on. But for like reading. It's like, kind of you have to do practice. And like. 30 00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:53.950 Jenny Duan: I think that's like from the practice test. I need to like kinda focus more on this. So let me find, like like specific passage 31 00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:22.430 Jenny Duan: cause I feel like a lot of your performance that I've noticed has to do with your mindset, and how you approach the text, because I feel like, you know before, when you were focused on the reading section and like maybe not, focus as much on that you were able to do really well. And then, when you focus on that, you're able to do really well again. But I think what you need is to just focu",
    "s on both. Like, treat every single section, every single problem as its own individual battle. Like every passage you're like, okay, I need to get this 100 every math problem. You should be thinking like, Okay, this is the 32 00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:45.470 Jenny Duan: like. You should treat every single question as if it were the only one that mattered like when you're doing it at the time. Because I think you know, being in the Zone for every question. Obviously, you're able to perform well, like you've demonstrated that you can do the reading writing section with minimal errors. You can do the math section with minimal errors. You just need to put yourself into that mindset every time you're doing like every single one of the questions that should be like the only one that matters when you're doing it? 33 00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:55.469 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay. So for parent passages, can you generally walk me through how you approach them like, just you see it? And what's what goes through your mind. 34 00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:17.779 huda: Yeah. So first, I kinda like go down to the questions. And II like try to answer like these these type of questions. First I just go back, and I quickly answer them. Before I would read this all in like one. Go, and then like, answer the questions. But lately. I think it helps me with time to just kinda read like the questions that I can answer right away, like, for example, like this one like 35 00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:43.389 huda: the use of the phrase, and I'd go back and just try to do that like, try to find where it is. And then, after that like when it starts asking you like their opinions on each other, and like what the main purpose whatever is. I'll go back and like just start reading the whole thing. Yeah. And then, like, actually, I'd I'd read the first passage and then like, answer any questions for the first passage, and then, usually, like 36 00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.940 huda: most of them, are just comparing like the",
    " relationship. So then I have to read the whole thing. 37 00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:57.720 huda: and then do you usually get the ones like the vocabulary questions. Do you forget this wrong, or do you usually get those right? I think the the ones that I get right? 38 00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:23.320 Jenny Duan: So you can join that first. But the thing about pair passage? What's really unique about the answer section is that like the first 3 to 5 questions, for usually it's about 3 to 4 questions will correspond to the first passage, and then there will be like 2 questions that correspond to the second passage, and then some questions talking about the relationships in between. So what you can do with the pair passages is you can 39 00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:35.710 Jenny Duan: treat the first 3 to 4 questions like its own separate passage. Only read the first passage, then do the first 3 to 4, then read the second passage, then do the rest, and if you do it like that sometimes it's 40 00:08:35.740 --> 00:09:00.729 Jenny Duan: easy to get confused with passage like you might mistake the content. The second passage for the content in the first passage, and vice versa. But if you do that so first only read the first passage, then answer the questions that pertain to the first passage. I'll usually be 3 to 4, sometimes 5, and then read the second passage, and then to the second passage questions, and then do the rest. I think doing it that way will help you versus reading both of them, and then trying to answer in that recall, because that's really hard. 41 00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.810 Jenny Duan: So 42 00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:31.029 Jenny Duan: why don't we just look at these questions like, do you see how the first 4 or 5 questions basically only correspond to passage one as a pair of passengers. Yeah, so that's yeah. So that's one strategy that you can use. So why don't we just pull up an extra sat do you have any copies of like additional messages that you haven't done ready",
    ". If you don't, I can always share my screen, too. I think it just. It's easier if you have about your screen. 43 00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.849 huda: I can get the the ones from the sat practice website. 44 00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:43.440 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Yeah. Just pull up anyone that you haven't done. And we can. Just we'll just only do the passage section there. 45 00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.530 Jenny Duan: Yep. 46 00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.500 huda: like. 47 00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.599 huda: I think. Also the science ones also kind of trip me up a bit. 48 00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.170 huda: yeah, like. 49 00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.049 huda: I think this is the period. 50 00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.479 huda: Oh, you know, this is not okay. 51 00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.300 huda: Listen. 52 00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:10.810 Jenny Duan: Okay. So why don't we talk about that strategy? Oh, the other thing that's important for you to read is the title. So start by reading the title, because I can often give you a lot of information. 53 00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:16.669 Jenny Duan: So passage one is adapted from this passage 2 is adapted from this. 54 00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.700 so 55 00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.640 Jenny Duan: this kind of tells you the subject and the relationship 56 00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:50.309 Jenny Duan: so based on this, you might see that, like the first one is published by NASA, the second one is published by Society for Science in the Galaxy, and then the first one is saying that free floating planets might be more common than stars, and then the second one, saying, like fewer big road planets from the galaxy. So that kind of tells you like, maybe they're adding onto each other. Maybe they're contrasting each other. But you don't know until you read. So 57 00:11:50.460 --> 00:12:00.909 Jenny Duan: let's start by reading the first passage and then doing the questions for the first passage. So why don't you just only read the passage one, and then ",
    "we can take a look at the questions together after that. 58 00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.210 huda: should I read it out loud? Or 59 00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.700 huda: if you want to, you don't have to, though. 60 00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.900 Jenny Duan: because I can also read it on your screen. So if you want to read out loud, but you don't have to. Okay. 61 00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.320 huda: Okay, I could have feeding it 62 00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:00.319 Jenny Duan: alright cool. So now, before you look at the questions, can you tell me what this passage is about in like one sentence? 63 00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.479 huda: So they're basically saying like 64 00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:19.100 huda: that if planets were like made similar to stars, and they'd be like, basically produced like, not as frequently, but the planets are like very evident. There's like a lot of them. 65 00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.929 Jenny Duan: Exactly. So now let's look at the questions. 66 00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.390 Jenny Duan: Okay? 67 00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:48.930 Jenny Duan: Question one, do the results of the survey described in passage one. Just support the conclusion that there are twice as many Jupiter mass free floating planets as Earth mass ones, so you might have to look back and look at the results of the survey. So let's see, in the third paragraph, there's talking about the survey right? We sampled a portion can overall. Okay. 68 00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:08.420 Jenny Duan: they are thought to be more common than free floating. Jupiter's. Okay. But now let's look back at the question. does this suggest that this is, support the conclusion that there are twice as many. So what is the answer? 69 00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.420 Jenny Duan: I'd say yes, and then 70 00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:24.160 huda: yes, because the survey actively estimates 71 00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.790 huda: the number of free floating planets in the galaxy. 72 00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.209 Jenny Duan: Okay. And w",
    "hy don't you go back and confirm? 73 00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.679 Jenny Duan: You know. 74 00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.550 Jenny Duan: what does this say? 75 00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.980 huda: They are more common than free, floating Jupiter's. 76 00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.029 Jenny Duan: What are more common? 77 00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:52.369 huda: planets smaller than Jupiter and Saturn? 78 00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.589 huda: Oh, wait, and it's like. 79 00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.349 huda: are more are thought to be more common than free flowing Jupiter. 80 00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.910 Jenny Duan: And what does the question say? 81 00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:16.490 huda: they're twice as many. Oh, okay, so it would be the opposite. Actually. 82 00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:26.630 huda: so no, because the survey shows that there are more earth mass free floating plants than Judomas ones. 83 00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.879 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So does that make sense? I think it's just. 84 00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:41.690 Jenny Duan: yeah. I think, for these type. It's type of questions. It's kind of confusing, because the passage is like 85 00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.970 huda: kind of jump between topics. And then it's like hard for me to keep up. But 86 00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.549 Jenny Duan: right. But does this make sense to you now? 87 00:16:52.730 --> 00:17:12.959 Jenny Duan: I think it's just like, be every single question like you should have a direct correspondence to the passage about where it talks about whatever the topic is. So you should be able to find, like a direct paragraph or direct sentence that gives you the answer you're looking for. So that should be so it should be like, clear what the answer is, just from when you look at it. 88 00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.780 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's look at the next question. 89 00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:23.430 Jenny Duan: And okay, now, you can see like they're looking for the exact line. So what is the exact line. 90 0",
    "0:17:27.569 --> 00:17:34.990 Jenny Duan: It's the as a result, right? Or you can do it. Yeah, correct. 91 00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.859 Jenny Duan: And then to get the next question. 92 00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.409 Jenny Duan: okay? So now you can say, according to passage to. So now you need to read the whole passage too. 93 00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:57.509 Jenny Duan: So this one, there's only 2 questions that correspond to passage one. But now we know for sure, like now you know for sure the ones you got about passage one. You know that those are correct because your brain is not confused with the material open passage 2, 94 00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.669 Jenny Duan: that's what we do 95 00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:44.219 Jenny Duan: 1,820 96 00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.220 Jenny Duan: and 97 00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.210 good morning 98 00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.230 Jenny Duan: that port. we're doing, that. I will 99 00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.150 thank you. 100 00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.310 huda: okay. 101 00:19:49.430 --> 00:20:11.579 huda: So basically, it was like about, I was talking about like this new method that they found to measure like how many big planets there are and then apparently like it, it conflicted like an earlier like hypothesis that there's like, many like Jupiter sized planets. 102 00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.969 huda: or I think. 103 00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.460 Jenny Duan: yeah, go ahead. 104 00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.009 huda: ye yeah. And then 105 00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.029 huda: But then they found that like 106 00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:37.840 huda: the smaller ones, like the earth's mass or heavier, are like most of the rogues, and, like the lighters, are like 107 00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:45.999 huda: they're kind of tossed out and like ejected not like the ones that are heavier, like Earth. 108 00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:53.699 Jenny Duan: exactly so based on that. What is the answer to the question for that? 109 00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.120 And a",
    "gain, you should be able to go back and find, like a specific line where it talks about that. 110 00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.420 huda: Hmm! 111 00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.490 huda: I'd say. And 112 00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.170 huda: a 113 00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.480 Jenny Duan: or actually and then. 114 00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.560 Jenny Duan: Oh. 115 00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:27.830 Jenny Duan: go ahead. I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna tell you what the correct answer is until you find the line. 116 00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:41.119 huda: Okay, cause d could be it because determine how many big which are caused by a rogue planet 117 00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.429 huda: for every typical star called mean sequence, or, sir. 118 00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:54.730 huda: because they looked at this many micro lensing events. and they tried to determine which were caused by a real planet. 119 00:21:55.170 --> 00:22:04.620 Jenny Duan: exactly. That's correct. 120 00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.390 Jenny Duan: Okay? I see. Yeah. 121 00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.050 huda: okay, that was like, cause at first I thought. 122 00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.380 huda: a, because 123 00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.260 huda: it. It's kind of mentioned over here. And then, yeah. 124 00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:24.259 Jenny Duan: but it says the new results sharply. Contrast, doesn't it? 125 00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.649 huda: So I think it would be the yeah. 126 00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.530 Jenny Duan: Correct. Yeah. 127 00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.060 huda: 7, 8. 128 00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.980 huda: Nice. 129 00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.050 Jenny Duan: So not about 46. 130 00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.569 huda: Make account for 132 00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.080 huda: Who identify 133 00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.790 Jenny Duan: and 134 00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.110 Jenny Duan: correct? Yeah. 135 00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.510 Jenny Duan: 47. 136 00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:17.409 Jenny Duan: The 6 paragraphs. So now you need ",
    "to look back at 6 pair back. And what does it serve as? Look at the options first? 137 00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.040 huda: where? 138 00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.440 huda: So right 139 00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.320 huda: day for? 140 00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.740 huda: But okay. 141 00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.169 huda: would it be? C, 142 00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.440 Jenny Duan: okay, can you explain why? 143 00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.149 huda: Okay. So 144 00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:35.219 huda: it talks about a recent fine recent findings to an explanation of how might reflect on previous findings. And then. So over here it talks about like the Co. Author of the 2,011, study 145 00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:47.390 huda: the new census fail to find evidence for a large population. So, however, the new data, and then, like the new claim, so like the data does reveal this. 146 00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.340 huda: so it's like a new hypothesis, I guess. 147 00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:59.830 huda: Oh. yeah. But it's not really like criticism. So it won't be that one. 148 00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.109 Jenny Duan: Okay, so what about C, 149 00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:25.889 huda: yes, see? I think, is the correct answer, because it kinda talks about like what they found in the find in their findings. And then, like kinda how it's like different from the the past ones. 150 00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.810 Jenny Duan: Oh, thank you. 151 00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.890 Jenny Duan: that's correct. 152 00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:38.700 Jenny Duan: And then 48. Is there a question? 48. Another vocabulary? 153 00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.920 huda: I'd say, D, 154 00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.419 Jenny Duan: we have live 155 00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:13.589 huda: because, although these are like kind of main like definitions of giving up. I think 156 00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:25.689 huda: in 59 II had to read back one more sentence, and kind of talks about it being like a magnifying glass, and it like focuses the light",
    " so we could infer that giving up 157 00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:31.440 huda: wouldn't hide or anything. It would show the planet's existence 158 00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.120 Jenny Duan: character. 159 00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.190 Jenny Duan: And then. 160 00:26:36.380 --> 00:27:03.890 Jenny Duan: so you're doing really? Well, here, I feel like you're getting all these. Okay. And now now we have the questions talking about the relationship between the both of them. Right? So what would you just say is the like relationship between passage one passage to in your own words. First. I'd say, like they talk about 2 different like, I guess. Wait. When was the first one from? Let me check? 161 00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:11.870 huda: okay, so this is the 2011 study. I think that they're talking about. 162 00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:42.820 Jenny Duan: okay? So like, I guess, the second passage is kind of counter, claiming the first one and I'd say, like, giving a different perspective on like an evidence on why, it wouldn't be the it would. The first claim isn't correct. 163 00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.819 Jenny Duan: And so based on what you said, given the answer to this is below, which one does that align the most with 164 00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:10.550 Jenny Duan: I'd say. 165 00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.550 huda: a 166 00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.260 okay. And 167 00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:24.409 Jenny Duan: can you re explain why? Now, given the context of the 2 paragraphs or the 2 passages? That's correct. By the way. 168 00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:47.939 huda: okay, thank you. So the so I would say, kind of like, process of elimination as well cause I know that they didn't agree, so wouldn't be C, and then B, it doesn't make sense, cause they didn't talk about a different field of study or like it didn't extend it using the micro lensing, but it kinda like contradicted it. 169 00:28:47.970 --> 00:29:06.830 huda: So that wouldn't be an viable option as well. And then d it's not really talk a",
    "bout variables, cause there isn't like a specific like reason why they got different results. I think it's just they disagree. So then looking back on a I'd say that. 170 00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:17.299 huda: this, like the study in passage 2 challenges the results. Because also, the first passage doesn't really give a specific study with like results. 171 00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:29.109 huda: Or actually it does. But yeah. But I'd say, like, it challenges the results. And it doesn't extend or support or like identify variables that are not in this. In the first one. 172 00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.870 Jenny Duan: great Jack. 173 00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:46.540 Jenny Duan: okay? And then finally 50. Now that they're asking for planning to screen them between the 2 passages. And so why don't we look at the answer, please? And we can the answer options. And we can do process of elimination to find like. 174 00:29:46.580 --> 00:30:01.890 Jenny Duan: which do the pass which point to the passages most clearly disagree? Yes, so I think it wouldn't be one cause or a, because everyone knows that there are pre floating Jupiter mass limits. 175 00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:18.630 huda: I'd say, for okay, I'm thinking now, B, because, like C, it doesn't really talk about in the first passage, and then d 176 00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:33.569 huda: like. That's not really what their main argument is like. That's just something that they add in. But so their main argument, I think B is the best option, because, the main focus is about the amount of free floating Jupiter mass minutes. There are. 177 00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 178 00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah. See? That wasn't so painful. Right? Like you did that. 179 00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:53.489 Jenny Duan: So I think, going off of that framework of kind of like a sandwich, where, like you look at the first one really questions corresponding to the first one, look at the second one, look at the quest",
    "ions corresponding to both, and then 180 00:30:53.490 --> 00:31:17.099 Jenny Duan: do the do it like that? I feel like that's a good way for you to approach this type of question. And then other general strategies for the reading section are to really look for evidence. So every single question should correspond to like a piece of evidence. Okay? Graphic sentence in the rest of the passage, and looking for that direct and specific point, should give you clues as to what the answer is looking for. 181 00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:37.129 Jenny Duan: Second thing is for the historical passages. I know the language is hard. I think those you just kinda have to power it through, not get distracted. Do you have a watch that you're using when you're taking the test. No. But I use like like I asked my Google home to like, set up a timer for the amount of time. 182 00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:59.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, I would get some type of physical watch or timer. You're not allowed to have like smart watches. If you can't have an apple watch, but if you have a dock and watch, or if you can borrow one from somewhere, or if you have like, a little desk timer that can't connect to the Internet. You can use that, and that will help you time your passages. You can spend about 10 to 12 min per passage. So, having that type of timer. 183 00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.690 Jenny Duan: I will tell you like how much time you have left, and like how 184 00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:13.100 Jenny Duan: you're doing in terms of like progress on the exam as long as it is not connected to the Internet. 185 00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.930 Jenny Duan: Okay. 186 00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:43.179 Jenny Duan: yeah. So like, just a normal watch, a normal like little desk, tiny clock something like that. It's not too big, and it can't make any noise, and it can't connect to the Internet. If you watch beeps you have to turn it off. Can't make any noise just because that distracts other people, because sometimes, if you're ",
    "in a big room because I don't know where you're taking the test, but depending on where you're taking, might not be able to see the clock. So that's thing about like having a timer. 187 00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:51.260 Jenny Duan: It's helpful for that reason that makes sense. Yeah, any other questions. 188 00:32:51.290 --> 00:33:03.309 huda: Maybe we could talk about like my like the signs, passages? I think. Let me go to the questions, the ones where I got a bunch wrong? Okay. 189 00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:28.420 huda: yeah. This one. This is the passage, the science passage that are struggling with. 190 00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.040 huda: what's specifically doable? I think. 191 00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:41.779 Jenny Duan: This evidence like, I got the question right. But the evidence is wrong for some reason. And 192 00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:53.020 huda: like, okay, these type of questions are kind of challenging, like the main focus shifts from and then like, I don't really know how to find. Oh, you know this is 193 00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.960 Jenny Duan: not related. Okay, wait. 194 00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.810 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 195 00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.720 Jenny Duan: little more. 196 00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:15.880 Jenny Duan: Let's go 197 00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:35.090 Jenny Duan: this question specifically, yeah, this one. Okay, so are you. Do you get tripped up on the tables, or are they helpful for you? Sometimes like it depends on the topic. But this time I was kind of stumped with these 2 questions. 198 00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.859 Jenny Duan: Okay, 19 and 20, Umhm. 199 00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.799 Jenny Duan: Okay, so based on table one. So first, you need to know what the 200 00:34:43.830 --> 00:35:11.079 Jenny Duan: authors also, I do have to go like in a couple of minutes, so I won't go through the rest of the passage. But I can definitely talk about these 2 questions, and if you have other questions, you can text me. And like, I'll respond later, is th",
    "at okay? Okay? So based on table one, how would the authors explain their observation. So what is their observation? First, we need to know that. Can you describe what their observation is requesting? 201 00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:23.229 huda: yeah. So I think they're kind of talking about how 202 00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:41.260 huda: like learning about how impact can. Yeah. So like, you know how like companies, they'll have like vision statements. I think, basically, this one is talk about like how 203 00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:54.489 huda: mission statements aren't really helpful to employees cause they keep hearing that they're worked as impactful but they don't feel like it, cause they have like a bunch of these mundane tasks to do. 204 00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.170 huda: yeah. And then 205 00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.399 Jenny Duan: yeah. So that's like, kind of the observation. 206 00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:13.070 Jenny Duan: okay. And then let's look at the 207 00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.099 Jenny Duan: back to the graph. Right? 208 00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.300 Jenny Duan: And so 209 00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.450 Jenny Duan: can I see the question one more time. 210 00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:30.740 Jenny Duan: And that is the data for portent task. Okay. 211 00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.820 Jenny Duan: important. 212 00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:38.099 Jenny Duan: So let's look at the data for portion tasks across all condition groups. So 213 00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.310 Jenny Duan: okay, important tasks. How 214 00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:48.669 Jenny Duan: meaningful they found it more meaningful. Right? So 215 00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:54.909 Jenny Duan: now we go back to the question. So now we know those 2 pieces, what the passions says, and what the 216 00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:00.739 Jenny Duan: So what do you think? The answer is based on what you know now? 217 00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:19.160 Jenny Duan: So you're looking for some like a reason why the data justifies the author's poin",
    "ts right? 218 00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.349 Jenny Duan: And can you summarize what you think? The author's points are again. 219 00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:36.559 Jenny Duan: So they think that purpose farming, which is like just having tell them their work is impactful. that isn't as useful as subordinate farming. 220 00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:37.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. 221 00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:47.350 Jenny Duan: and why would why would meaning? Why would personal task be more meaningful. Explain that 222 00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:55.289 huda: it will be more meaningful because it makes them feel like they're not just doing the mending task. And that 223 00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.969 huda: Oh, would it be a 224 00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.550 Jenny Duan: yeah, exactly right. 225 00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.510 huda: Does that make sense? Why, yeah, I put 226 00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.290 the arena I put. 227 00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:11.199 huda: yeah, be for this one for some reason. But 228 00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:20.409 Jenny Duan: but I guess just walking through that. Does that make more sense to you? Now? Cool, awesome. So now let's look at the second question. Right? 229 00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:32.250 Jenny Duan: So taking the other to 2 tables. Best support which statement. so we already know what the first tables is saying, cause we already looked at it, and the second. Now let's look at the second table. 230 00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:46.250 Jenny Duan: So the design table is showing that important tasks are perceived to be more meaningful across all types of frames. Right? They're more enjoyable. So now we know that 231 00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:53.600 Jenny Duan: important tasks, both more enjoyable and more meaningful. So now let's look back at the answer options 232 00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.520 right? 233 00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.750 Jenny Duan: And 234 00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.540 Jenny Duan: and so 235 00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:08.060 Jenny Duan: what do you think? The corre",
    "ct answer is. it's 236 00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:20.799 Jenny Duan: I think it would be. I think it could be be 237 00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:34.850 Jenny Duan: yeah, why? So the reason I think it's speed, because you can see there and table, too, that, like the numbers here, they're like a lot more different than these values. 238 00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:59.469 Jenny Duan: Like er no these guys are really different. In comparison. Same could be said for this 1 3.8 to 4.8. Exactly. So. Do you see how like they close? The graphs will just lead you to the answer. So what you can do if you're 239 00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:23.479 Jenny Duan: confused by questions like this. Look at the graph, and check whether or not to answer. See? The question corresponds to the answer on the graph, and just like check each and every school one of them, until you find the correct answer. It would be a little time consuming, but like there should be one that is definitely correct. There should be definitely wrong. That makes sense. Yeah. Cool. Any other questions. 240 00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:31.689 huda: Do you have any like general tips for me like in preparing for like the test in a few days. 241 00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:45.799 Jenny Duan: I think. Just watch your mindset, and make sure you treat every single one as like every single question as important. I think that's like the main thing that you can do. So 242 00:40:45.800 --> 00:41:09.929 Jenny Duan: other than that. I mean just obviously more repetition. If you know that you need bars, practice with signs, passages, then just look at you know the bonus stuff that you have, and like specifically this, I can pass it into those questions. Like, you don't have to do an entire reading section one sign section on one history section. Yeah, does that make sense. 243 00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.639 Jenny Duan: Cool. 244 00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:22.659 Jenny Duan: Yeah, of course, good luck. And technically, you need anything else before that. Yeah, of ",
    "course. Thank you."
