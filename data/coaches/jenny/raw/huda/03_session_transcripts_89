So, for example, if you were applying as like a computer science major, you could say, like, say, you were interested in quantum physics, you could say like. 4 00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:48.219 Jenny Duan: How does like the qubit simultaneously like exist in these 2 places like say something a little bit nerdy. 5 00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.899 Jenny Duan: because I think Mit really likes that. 6 00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.130 huda: And. 7 00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.029 Jenny Duan: Let me look at the major at Mit. 8 00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.450 Jenny Duan: Sometimes they'll have like questions posted on their website. And you can just paraphrase one of those like, I know, symbolic systems. Kind of does that. But 9 00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.020 Jenny Duan: let me see, here 10 00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.190 Jenny Duan: is this major comparative media studies slash writing. 11 00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.080 huda: Yeah. 12 00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.479 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that we need to emphasize the writing a bit more here. 13 00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:01.849 huda: No, but the major is just comparative. Media studies. 14 00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.120 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, the writing is like, you're right. You're right. 15 00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, you're right. Sorry about that. 16 00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.310 huda: Okay. 17 00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.179 Jenny Duan: What about this question? 18 00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.894 huda: Alright 19 00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.749 Jenny Duan: You can edit it, too. It's just a kind of like a placeholder. 20 00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.249 huda: Yeah, I think that kind of sums up the major. 21 00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 22 00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.929 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. I feel like this looks 23 00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.639 Jenny Duan: good. Now, I think that adding the question in the beginning kind of like helps contextualize your intellectual curiosity. And then 24 00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.470 Jenny Duan: I think the rest of the essay looks good. How do you feel about it? 25 00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.590 huda: Yeah, I feel good about, too. Yeah. 26 00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you want to read it out loud one time. 27 00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:23.160 huda: In what ways do emerging media technologies reshape human communication and expression? A lifelong fascination with how media shapes perception draws me to Mit's Cms program. I've explored narrative design through game development Rpgs that teach stem through side quests at Mit. I envisioned myself, creating more, pushing the boundaries of traditional journalism at the open documentary lab 28 00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.069 huda: game jamming and Cms. 301, and blending my passion for technology with storytelling through research on media innovation with Professor William 29 00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:42.840 huda: Horicio, through Cms. I'm excited to deepen my understanding of Media's societal impact and develop tools, to empower diverse voices globally. 30 00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Looks great. 31 00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.830 Jenny Duan: Awesome. This is finalized. Let's move on. 32 00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.160 huda: Actually over here, she mentioned. Like in the past. I've explored narrative design. 33 00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:17.400 Jenny Duan: I don't think you have words, but also, I think, like explored already, like it's already past tense, so I feel like in the past might be redundant. Also, they have access to your activities list and the rest of your essays. So they'll know that what you're talking about is synthoria. I think. 34 00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.430 huda: Okay. 35 00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:24.519 Jenny Duan: Right here.

And what did you learn from it. I changed the last paragraph. 61 00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.239 huda: Because the last one was a little too verbatim. 62 00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.320 Jenny Duan: Okay, I just wanna go through these first.st 63 00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:24.020 Jenny Duan: I know we already looked at this one, but I just want to see if this is good. This one needs to be cut. Does it still need to be cut. 64 00:09:25.592 --> 00:09:27.479 huda: I don't think so. 65 00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.290 Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna take away this. I think we finalize this. 66 00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.600 Jenny Duan: This. 67 00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.580 Jenny Duan: Let's take a look. You still have some words here 68 00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.030 Jenny Duan: looks great. I think you just have room to expand for 50 more words. 69 00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.999 huda: Alright. Where should I put more like detail when I'm like expanding. 70 00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:17.990 Jenny Duan: This. 71 00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.390 Jenny Duan: Can you add more about money? But I I don't really think it's necessary. 72 00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:41.790 Jenny Duan: Let me see what. Let's look at the the rest of your essays to see if there's anything else that you haven't 73 00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.380 Jenny Duan: written about. 74 00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.420 Jenny Duan: Do you talk about the like? How your town is a little bit rural. 75 00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.089 Jenny Duan: I don't think so. 76 00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.319 huda: Yeah, I don't think so. I don't think I have. 77 00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.360 Jenny Duan: You can talk about that a little bit. 78 00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.110 Jenny Duan: You can either talk about it here or in this last paragraph 79 00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.650 Jenny Duan: can say, like right here like in my community, of 80 00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:18.020 Jenny Duan: however, many people in Mountain House, California, I've da da learned that, etc. 81 00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.770 huda: Maybe, like 82 00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.890 huda: I've learned like 83 00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:21.440 huda: I've seen my volunteering like I don't know how to say this like. 84 00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.910 huda: not verbatim, but it would be like 85 00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:30.660 huda: I've seen my volunteering like impact people, but like not in those words. 86 00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.520 huda: Hmm! 87 00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:13.960 Jenny Duan: maybe something about like the power of supporting one another, or like supporting each other within the context of a greater community. 88 00:13:15.801 --> 00:13:20.210 huda: Yeah, maybe I could be like I witnessed like. 89 00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.370 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's perfect. 90 00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:34.720 huda: Perfect witness power of community support, maybe. 91 00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.540 Jenny Duan: And be more specific like, how did you see that. 92 00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.120 huda: Like in community events, volunteering opportunities. 93 00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.860 huda: Like small businesses. 94 00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.080 huda: Yeah. 95 00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.220 Jenny Duan: And. 96 00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:17.570 huda: I've witnessed community members. Maybe instead of like the power of community support to be like numbers. 97 00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:23.440 huda: Like, I guess what I'm trying to say is like like being from like a rural town like I see. 98 00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.349 huda: like all these people support each other through like 99 00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:56.430 huda: we have, like a lot of like community events which, like a lot of like youth, volunteer for, and they kind of just like help out like setting it up and like doing that. And then also like the fact that we have like small businesses when we don't have like restaurants, and like proper like resources, like, they help each other out through there. And I guess that inspires me to also show like support in community. 100 00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.010 Jenny Duan: It's the power of. 101 00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 102 00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:12.670 Jenny Duan: I think I think I don't think I need to give an aggressive example there, because the next sentence kind of already shows an example. 103 00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.550 Jenny Duan: I think you should. Let's see where else you can add some words. 104 00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.909 Jenny Duan: maybe you can say something like I knew what I had to do or describe your thought process here. 105 00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.130 Jenny Duan: And like, describe more how you are able to manage the situation or challenge 106 00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.929 huda: Maybe I could say something like like kind of 107 00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.429 huda: I was thinking something like, but here's the thing about gamers. We're trained to spot solutions. 108 00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's great that I think something like that would be perfect. 109 00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:29.923 huda: Or maybe 110 00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.440 huda: Yeah. Here. 111 00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.089 Jenny Duan: Sounds like, but as a gamer we're trained to spot solutions. 112 00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.439 Jenny Duan: something along those lines. It'd be perfect. 113 00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.029 huda: Maybe like not like I feel like it doesn't make sense to say. But as a gamer I'll just say as a gamer. 114 00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 115 00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:16.080 huda: Maybe like, does this order like this sentence before, where it says, in my rural hometown, Mountain House, California. And when is the power of community support. 116 00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:21.939 huda: Should I put it before the I see beyond surface level problems to the people affected. 117 00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think before sounds better. 118 00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.110 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can write something about how like 119 00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:33.579 Jenny Duan: people don't always expect that other people are going through these struggles on the outside, but like having gone through something yourself, you're more empathetic. As a result, you can write it in the last paragraph. 120 00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.270 huda: Hmm, yeah, it's a good idea. 121 00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:44.549 Jenny Duan: Because, like some like, maybe it's like, say, some people carry their stories on the outside. Others are like. 122 00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:51.619 Jenny Duan: I don't know, or some you know how like some people are more visible about the problems. And then other people not so much. 123 00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:05.740 huda: We're 124 00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.010 huda: and 125 00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.570 huda: this I don't really like the wording of the sentence, but I just kind of like wrote something down. 126 00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.639 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think this is the right placement. But I think there's probably like a better way. You can phrase this. 127 00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:59.759 huda: like, what's like? The kind of point that I'm trying to get across with the sentence. 128 00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.530 Jenny Duan: That other. Some people are outward about their struggles. Other people are inward about their struggles, and, like 129 00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:13.079 Jenny Duan: you've developed sort of a sense of empathy through going by going through this experience yourself. 130 00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:19.576 huda: So like I don't know how to word it. 131 00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:35.209 huda: Like. I don't want to say like, we don't like the wording that like we don't know what people are going through, because I feel like that's really cliche. 132 00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.550 Jenny Duan: I agree. 133 00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.859 huda: That's kind of like the point. 134 00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:48.199 Jenny Duan: But even a 12 year old 135 00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.980 Jenny Duan: I couldn't make a meaningful difference. 136 00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:13.299 Jenny Duan: Let me write like a bad sentence, and see if I can fix it. 137 00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:23.270 Jenny Duan: I think something like this, like 2 like one or 2 sentences. It's yeah. 138 00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.530 huda: I don't know how this sentence makes sense, but 139 00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.940 huda: I also did like here. 140 00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.569 Jenny Duan: See you. 141 00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.579 Jenny Duan: What does it mean by to see the outward and inward like? Look past the outward. 142 00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.509 huda: Yeah, kind of like to like. 143 00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.710 huda: I learned to 144 00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:11.319 huda: empathize that like even like the inward, like people with inward struggles like sometimes don't express as much like 145 00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:17.170 huda: like kind of like looking deeper into some people, maybe not. Everyday strangers might not be a good example, but 146 00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.470 Jenny Duan: Deeper. 147 00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.910 Jenny Duan: Maybe the pick that. 148 00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.480 huda: Yeah. 149 00:26:39.947 --> 00:26:42.710 huda: I think these could be like, combined somehow, like. 150 00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:43.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 151 00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.540 huda: Well. 152 00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.030 huda: yeah, I like that. 153 00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:11.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that's I. I tried to keep like a game analogy going. Do you feel like it works? Or do you feel like it's like we can also get rid of it. 154 00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.010 huda: I think like 155 00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.760 huda: I think, since there's like 2 references, I think we could just do one. 156 00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, we can get rid of skip this. 157 00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.210 huda: Oh, we're good on word, count. Now it's exactly 2, 25 words. 158 00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.970 huda: That's perfect. 159 00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:44.589 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think this is finalized. What do you think? Do you want to read this essay out loud? I kind of want to hear in your voice. 160 00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.330 huda: Yeah. 161 00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:51.639 huda: Picture an aggressive 12 year old, clawing at her ipad, desperate for an elusive fortnight Victory Royale 162 00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:56.219 huda: money was tight, dental visits, now a luxury were paid in installments. 163 00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:06.860 huda: One afternoon our lights suddenly flickered out, my fortnight character jogged in place, my sister's lamp died, plunging her novel into darkness. My brother's nursery rhymes vanished. 164 00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.939 huda: anger morphed into determination. 165 00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:32.240 huda: As a gamer. I'm essentially trained to spot solutions as my parents searched for cash, I fixated on the valiant hero that could rescue us. The crumpled $20 Andrew Jackson I got from Eve weeks earlier. We rushed to the bank, and 30 min later our lights turned on again. What initially felt like sacrificing my gaming dreams revealed something greater that even a 12 year old can make a meaningful difference. 166 00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:37.079 huda: While some people bear their challenges outwards, others fight more invisible quests. 167 00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:54.300 huda: I've developed an understanding and empathy for everyday strangers stories. Now when I develop AI ethics, games, write articles or lead workshops. I carry that same sense of responsibility in my rural Hometown Mountain House, California, I've witnessed the power of community support. 168 00:28:54.300 --> 00:29:09.449 huda: I see beyond surface level problems to the real people affected. Knowing that small actions ripple outward, whether it's helping a family keep their light on or ensuring technology serves humanity ethically, I've learned that we all have the power and duty to lift others up. 169 00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.730 huda: Yeah, I really liked. 170 00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.890 Jenny Duan: Yay. Amazing. 171 00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.160 Jenny Duan: Amazing. 172 00:29:18.139 --> 00:29:25.290 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think we're good with that. All the mit stuff. How are you feeling. 173 00:29:26.376 --> 00:29:34.289 huda: I feel good. I think I really like the prompts with Mit. So yeah, I think the essays are actually pretty easy to write. 174 00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. Well, I'm so happy. I feel like you're done. 175 00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:44.180 Jenny Duan: Is the activities list and everything else kind of the same? Or is it? I don't know if it's different in some way. 176 00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:44.950 huda: It's like. 177 00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:51.509 huda: and it's yeah, it's like the same. But it's also a lot like the scholarship ones, because it's like. 178 00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:59.129 huda: kind of specific like work opportunities, volunteer opportunities like like, it's like separated. But. 179 00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.570 Jenny Duan: Okay. Awesome. 180 00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:06.489 Jenny Duan: Do you feel ready to submit this? Do you have any other questions before. 181 00:30:07.563 --> 00:30:16.329 huda: Actually, there was one question I was working on like the application of my dad, and then so I have to put in like my dad's current. 182 00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:22.329 Jenny Duan: Like, and so I put him in as like unemployed, and then it asks if he has a business. 183 00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.790 huda: And then like. 184 00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:33.940 huda: So he was just wondering what I should do to like describe, like his businesses, like industry, because I said consultancy, because it's kind of vague, but it's also like. 185 00:30:34.331 --> 00:30:38.250 huda: gives an idea, because I don't want to say like college prep, because that's like. 186 00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.239 Jenny Duan: You can just say consulting, yeah, just say, like, 187 00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.520 Jenny Duan: education, or you can say, like, gigs be stuff. You can say like 188 00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.889 Jenny Duan: job market. I don't know something like that. 189 00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.569 huda: Do you think just like saying consultancy is fine. 190 00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.209 Jenny Duan: I think it's I think it's fine. I don't think you need to be specific. 191 00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:58.020 huda: Okay. Yeah. 192 00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:04.520 Jenny Duan: Not going to have any impact on whether or not you're admitted. Yeah, I would say generally, don't give them more information than you need to. 193 00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.240 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah. 194 00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.689 huda: They're very nosy. 195 00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:09.522 Jenny Duan: I know. There. 196 00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:15.130 Jenny Duan: Yes, you don't need to give them more information than required. 197 00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.210 huda: Yes. 198 00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:22.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool anything else? Or do you feel like you? Can you feel good to submit. 199 00:31:23.705 --> 00:31:25.845 huda: I think I'm good. 200 00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:34.499 huda: I wait so for. And then also in the mit application, there's like a job section. But I've never really had like a job, or like internship, or anything. 201 00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.990 huda: So I think. 202 00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.309 Jenny Duan: Give me the blank. 203 00:31:38.356 --> 00:31:42.400 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's fine. Not everyone's had a job. And yeah, that's normal. 204 00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:43.480 huda: Okay. 205 00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:45.970 Jenny Duan: Hey? Anything else? 206 00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:48.570 huda: Other than that. I think I'm good. 207 00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.460 Jenny Duan: Alright amazing. This is so great. 208 00:31:52.355 --> 00:31:56.810 Jenny Duan: Another essay, another school done. Let's look at Upenn now. 209 00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:03.749 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's fine. Let's brainstorm for this, let's say. 210 00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.150 Jenny Duan: thank you. Note, what are you? Who are you thinking about thinking. 211 00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:16.350 huda: I don't know if it has to be like someone that we know, like personally, because. 212 00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.750 Jenny Duan: Something has to. 213 00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.519 huda: Cause. I feel like it would be kind of cool if I can like write a note 214 00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.599 huda: so like a thank you. Note to the 1st like to the developer of like the 1st game I ever played. 215 00:32:28.157 --> 00:32:29.260 huda: So it's like. 216 00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:41.930 Jenny Duan: Oh, that would be amazing. That's a great idea. I think it has to be like a feasible person. But I don't think it needs to be someone that you know personally like. I don't think you can make say like Hermione Granger from Harry Potter. But if it's a game, if it's like a real person. 217 00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.560 huda: Yeah. 218 00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.360 huda: Oh. 219 00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.510 Jenny Duan: 1st game that you ever played. 220 00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:49.629 huda: No, it was like my, okay. I think it was 221 00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.110 huda: Jeff Kenny who made Pop tropica. 222 00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.200 Jenny Duan: Oh! 223 00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:01.280 huda: Yeah, yeah, it's my childhood. So, and I think, like. 224 00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:05.789 huda: he just taught me like a lot of things. And like. 225 00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:31.570 huda: definitely inspired me a lot, and like a lot of the things that I do like, even my like the games that I develop like I look at like his games for reference, and like even like he. Also, he's also a writer, obviously so. I read that a lot going up. And then so yeah, right? Like a thank you. Letter to him. And kind of if I want to tell a little bit about myself, I can also talk about like how like 226 00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.659 huda: he's influenced like my narrative style, I guess. 227 00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:40.479 Jenny Duan: I think that's perfect. I think you can just do a genuine thank you. I don't think it needs to be 228 00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.090 Jenny Duan: much more than that. Yeah, 229 00:33:46.780 --> 00:34:00.870 Jenny Duan: okay, I don't. I don't know if this needs to be like, I don't think we need to format. I think we, if you just write a very genuine thank you. We can kind of go from there. It's very short. It's only 1 50 to 200 words. So there's not much room anyways. 230 00:34:03.355 --> 00:34:07.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, how will you explore community at Penn? 231 00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.509 Jenny Duan: This is like a Y school, and this is like a Y major. 232 00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:19.139 Jenny Duan: Oh, my, gosh, what? Why? School? Why, department? And why? Major, okay? 233 00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.330 Jenny Duan: Asking Wi-fi questions, what. 234 00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.560 huda: I don't really understand. Like, why there's like 3 separate ones. 235 00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.030 Jenny Duan: I don't know either way. I guess this is more about like social 236 00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:45.230 Jenny Duan: clubs, and this is like a hit. This is a diversity essay hidden in a Y school essay because they're saying like how your experience and perspectives will help shape Penn. So this is like this is their version of a diversity essay. So 237 00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:51.320 Jenny Duan: I would definitely talk about Muslim identity. You can talk about like 238 00:34:51.409 --> 00:35:06.180 Jenny Duan: women in games here. Your involvement in that organization. We can talk about. Maybe, like women in Cs organizations that's bleeding a bit into the pre-professional. But it's fine Indian heritage and rural background. 239 00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:07.750 huda: Okay. 240 00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:20.250 Jenny Duan: Like you're you have a. You have a couple of essays that you've written for different schools about like the the trees in Mount House, California. So I think you can use an adaptation of that essay. 241 00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.450 huda: Yeah. 242 00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.940 Jenny Duan: What type of trees are they? 243 00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.740 huda: Almond trees. 244 00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.640 Jenny Duan: Of the almond trees. Essay. Yeah. 245 00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:35.340 Jenny Duan: I think if you just adapt, like one of those essays that you've written, you should be good for this one. It's like, pretty much the same thing, I think. 246 00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.750 Jenny Duan: Okay, so just yeah, and I think everything else. 247 00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.960 Jenny Duan: Yeah, did. The director of the pro. Actually, did the director ever respond to you? I know it's 248 00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:52.340 Jenny Duan: Thanksgiving. Okay, it's fine, I think. Give it a little bit more time. 249 00:35:53.513 --> 00:36:01.590 Jenny Duan: And then, did these essays? Do you have any questions about how to write them or your process? 250 00:36:02.468 --> 00:36:07.071 huda: No, I think I'll I'll try and come up with an idea, or like 251 00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.160 huda: I mean, I guess this one I already have an idea. But like 252 00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.729 huda: I'm just trying to figure out how I'll be able to stretch it out to like 6 50 words. 253 00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.500 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's super long. It's another common episode. 254 00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.899 huda: All common fs, if it's like a lot. 255 00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.369 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then have you started thinking more about your portfolio and what you're gonna put together for that. 256 00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:35.290 huda: I'm not really sure cause, it said, like one of the requirements was like a 3D. Like model, and. 257 00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.029 Jenny Duan: Does it require a 3D. Model or. 258 00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.020 huda: Gotcha. 259 00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.130 Jenny Duan: Recommended. 260 00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.580 huda: Let's see 261 00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.850 huda: it said. 262 00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:08.190 huda: At least one drawing in physical medium, at least 1 3D. Composition. 263 00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.520 huda: and then, like like the game, is. 264 00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.580 huda: is like additional like if you want to, but like the art and the 265 00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:26.690 huda: the art and the 3D. Composition are like mandatory, apparently so. 266 00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.429 Jenny Duan: So 3D. Composition. 267 00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.930 huda: Remember, I think like the last time I did that was in like 268 00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.849 huda: middle school, so I don't know. 269 00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:36.890 huda: Hmm! 270 00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:39.950 huda: Done it. 271 00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.830 Jenny Duan: Digital or or physical. 272 00:37:43.005 --> 00:37:43.690 huda: Digital. 273 00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.780 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's fine. I think you can do Blender. 274 00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.749 Jenny Duan: You can look up a blender tutorial and make your own from that. 275 00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.370 huda: Yeah. 276 00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.590 Jenny Duan: Do you have blender on your computer. 277 00:37:54.416 --> 00:37:56.699 huda: I'll probably just download it. 278 00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.700 Jenny Duan: I've made some blender art before. It's actually kind of fun. It does take a long time. 279 00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.060 Jenny Duan: Hello. 280 00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.884 huda: I mean, like a donut in like middle school, but then, like. 281 00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.130 Jenny Duan: Okay, I did this before. 282 00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:30.019 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, it's fine. I've made this before. It shouldn't take you too long. I think this would be like a good project for the next couple of days. Go to Youtube, look up a blender tutorial, and then find, like some different find, a couple of different tutorials. For example, you can make a scene that's like. 283 00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:40.380 Jenny Duan: let's just take the donut as an example. You don't use this as an example, but like you can find like a donut, and then like an ice cream, and then like a couple of other things, and then just like, put them all together in one scene. 284 00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:55.389 Jenny Duan: so it doesn't look like too much like you're copying just the tutorial like. Don't make an exact same from the tutorial like. Make the objects, and then learn how to put in some effects like snow or something, and then, just like, put it in. That's what I did for my Blender assignment at school I took a class on Blender. 285 00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.590 huda: Cool. 286 00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.649 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I think that's what would be good. 287 00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 288 00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:18.180 Jenny Duan: I think I don't think this should be the barrier. I think that should be fine for the next like it will take you like a week to probably do. But I would say it's important to submit a digital portfolio, so you get a chance to show them your game. 289 00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:19.670 huda: Yeah. 290 00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.400 Jenny Duan: And 291 00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.780 Jenny Duan: and I think for this interest aligned. Let's talk a little bit more about this essay, because I think 292 00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:32.599 Jenny Duan: with 650 words. It can't just be like, I want this because, Xyz, I think you have to write a story for this. 293 00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.330 huda: Yeah. 294 00:39:33.593 --> 00:39:40.169 Jenny Duan: But this is like pretty much just your common app, like I feel like your common app is just already good enough for this prompt. 295 00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:41.340 huda: Yeah. 296 00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:46.449 Jenny Duan: I don't quite understand. Okay, if you were to write another common app, what would you write it about? 297 00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.190 huda: Like, okay? So since it's like, still about games, maybe like. 298 00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:07.360 huda: like, maybe I can pick one aspect of like my personal statement that like, for example, I don't. I don't know if I 299 00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:12.379 huda: I talked about like a couple things about video games, but I think like, if I talk about like the 300 00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.919 huda: I don't think rule switching would really match the. 301 00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.780 Jenny Duan: Oh! 302 00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.759 huda: Purpose of this essay. But 303 00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.520 huda: maybe like I can talk about like 304 00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.450 huda: the 1st game to ever exist. 305 00:40:33.001 --> 00:40:37.119 huda: Cause like games aren't just like video games. And like. 306 00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.159 huda: So I could talk about like 307 00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:49.850 huda: like a historic game that was like the 1st game to ever exist. And maybe like, talk about like, how like gaming has evolved from there and like how maybe 308 00:40:50.383 --> 00:40:55.980 huda: I don't know how to like make this like specifically like personal, but like, like 309 00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:09.640 huda: about how that historic video game has changed throughout the years with new developments like technology and like, now mixing in media like, now, VR, so like, maybe that kind of approach. 310 00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.159 Jenny Duan: Okay, that would be good. 311 00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.671 Jenny Duan: Another thing that I was thinking about is 312 00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:25.410 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can talk about like cause this is like a computer graphics type of like, that's what the focus of the program is about 313 00:41:26.123 --> 00:41:34.860 Jenny Duan: to my understanding. And then other things on top of that. But maybe you can talk about like recreations of real world things in Minecraft, and like 314 00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.009 Jenny Duan: how we went from like. 315 00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.319 Jenny Duan: I think you should go a little bit deeper into the computer graphics aspect of it. 316 00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.420 Jenny Duan: To demonstrate like your knowledge and interest in this area. 317 00:41:50.510 --> 00:42:05.520 Jenny Duan: So maybe you can go from like how each pixel, like it, used to carry only this amount of information. But now, like computer imaging, technology, has gone so much more advanced that we can depict like these certain scenes with computer graphics that we weren't able to do before. 318 00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.728 Jenny Duan: even though I know, like, computer graphics are not your 319 00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.990 Jenny Duan: like, that's not exactly what you want to do. But 320 00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.710 Jenny Duan: that's what the major is focused about. 321 00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:24.845 Jenny Duan: because it says like, it combines major coursework in computer graphics and Fine Arts courses within Penn's 322 00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:32.740 Jenny Duan: School of Design. The program was created in 1998 to educate a new generation of people to work in computer graphics. 323 00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.759 Jenny Duan: So I think, whatever your essay is about. 324 00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:42.409 Jenny Duan: emphasize, like the graphics part. And you might need to do a little bit of more research onto what that entails. But I think like 325 00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:49.269 Jenny Duan: getting into like, why, computer graphics specifically is important to you because these people are gonna know, like. 326 00:42:49.550 --> 00:43:13.940 Jenny Duan: obviously, you are applying for this program. But, like in the context of your pen application, they need to know, like, why are you doing this program and not Usc's games program like, what's the difference between pursuing a major in games and a music major in computer graphics like, yes, they can lead to the same outcome. But like, it's still a slightly different pursuit. So you should tailor this essay to like the study of computer graphics more so than just games in and of itself. 327 00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:14.630 huda: Yeah. 328 00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.400 Jenny Duan: That's what this major focuses on. 329 00:43:20.686 --> 00:43:21.939 Jenny Duan: So yeah. 330 00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:28.459 Jenny Duan: I think that the say that you suggested is great. My suggestion is, can maybe talk about like 331 00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.999 Jenny Duan: Minecraft depictions of real world buildings. But you don't need to do that like 332 00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:39.776 Jenny Duan: an example of this would be like, maybe like talking about 333 00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:49.263 Jenny Duan: I don't know what's like a relevant like the 334 00:43:50.380 --> 00:44:18.829 Jenny Duan: like the I don't. I don't know like the how to pronounce this, but like the Al Kaba, like in a Mecca like something like that. And how people are building like really cool things all in Minecraft, and how that's like a connection to culture community. And you could talk about Mountain House, California, your high school, like some people in high school like they made digital problems on Minecraft or Roblox, or something. So that's like one thing you could talk about. But I don't think it exactly matters as long as it's 335 00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:22.169 Jenny Duan: you weave in the computer imaging and graphics aspect. 336 00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:30.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, what's the next school on your list? I think we can put that next school for next time. But 337 00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.044 Jenny Duan: I just wanna know what's the next school? 338 00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.250 huda: Me, too. 339 00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.670 huda: It's Carnegie Mellon. 340 00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.590 Jenny Duan: Okay. 341 00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:51.880 Jenny Duan: So the next time we, I think you should take some time this week and do your blender thing for the Upenn portfolio. So next steps are, submit the Mit application 342 00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:58.680 Jenny Duan: draft the Upen essays, and then spend some time and work on that blender portfolio thing 343 00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.539 Jenny Duan: for Upen. When do you want to meet next. 344 00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:06.500 Jenny Duan: or when do you think you'll be able to have like good progress on these things? 345 00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.330 huda: I think. Tuesday, maybe. 346 00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.340 Jenny Duan: Tuesday. Okay. 347 00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:13.590 Jenny Duan: Sounds great. 348 00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.249 Jenny Duan: Is there a certain time on Tuesday that. 349 00:45:19.195 --> 00:45:20.320 huda: Just 7 Pm. 350 00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:21.710 Jenny Duan: What? 351 00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.279 huda: The 7 Pm. Work. 352 00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.500 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's great, I know. 353 00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.460 Jenny Duan: Okay, then I'll see you on at 7 pm. 354 00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:32.710 Jenny Duan: On Tuesday. 355 00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.020 huda: Alright, great. 356 00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.680 Jenny Duan: Oh, alright! Talk to you then. 357 00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:39.389 huda: See you soon. Bye. 358 00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.200 Jenny Duan: Bye.",

So, for example, if you were applying as like a computer science major, you could say, like, say, you were interested in quantum physics, you could say like. 4 00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:48.219 Jenny Duan: How does like the qubit simultaneously like exist in these 2 places like say something a little bit nerdy. 5 00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.899 Jenny Duan: because I think Mit really likes that. 6 00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.130 huda: And. 7 00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.029 Jenny Duan: Let me look at the major at Mit. 8 00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.450 Jenny Duan: Sometimes they'll have like questions posted on their website. And you can just paraphrase one of those like, I know, symbolic systems. Kind of does that. But 9 00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.020 Jenny Duan: let me see, here 10 00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.190 Jenny Duan: is this major comparative media studies slash writing. 11 00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.080 huda: Yeah. 12 00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.479 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that we need to emphasize the writing a bit more here. 13 00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:01.849 huda: No, but the major is just comparative. Media studies. 14 00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.120 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, the writing is like, you're right. You're right. 15 00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, you're right.

It's just a kind of like a placeholder. 20 00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.249 huda: Yeah, I think that kind of sums up the major. 21 00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.910 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. 22 00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:",
    "44.929 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. I feel like this looks 23 00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.639 Jenny Duan: good. Now, I think that adding the question in the beginning kind of like helps contextualize your intellectual curiosity. And then 24 00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.470 Jenny Duan: I think the rest of the essay looks good. How do you feel about it? 25 00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.590 huda: Yeah, I feel good about, too. Yeah. 26 00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you want to read it out loud one time. 27 00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:23.160 huda: In what ways do emerging media technologies reshape human communication and expression? A lifelong fascination with how media shapes perception draws me to Mit's Cms program. I've explored narrative design through game development Rpgs that teach stem through side quests at Mit. I envisioned myself, creating more, pushing the boundaries of traditional journalism at the open documentary lab 28 00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.069 huda: game jamming and Cms. 301, and blending my passion for technology with storytelling through research on media innovation with Professor William 29 00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:42.840 huda: Horicio, through Cms. I'm excited to deepen my understanding of Media's societal impact and develop tools, to empower diverse voices globally. 30 00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Looks great. 31 00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.830 Jenny Duan: Awesome. This is finalized. Let's move on. 32 00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.160 huda: Actually over here, she mentioned. Like in the past. I've explored narrative design. 33 00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:17.400 Jenny Duan: I don't think you have words, but also, I think, like explored already, like it's already past tense, so I feel like in the past might be redundant. Also, they have access to your activities list and the rest of your essays. So they'll know that what you're talking about is synthoria.

We're trained to spot solutions. 108 00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's great that I think something like that would be perfect. 109 00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:29.923 huda: Or maybe 110 00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.440 huda: Yeah. Here. 111 00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.089 Jenny Duan: Sounds like, but as a gamer we're trained to spot solutions. 112 00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.439 Jenny Duan: something along those lines. It'd be perfect. 113 00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.029 huda: Maybe like not like I feel like it doesn't make sense to say. But as a gamer I'll just say as a gamer. 114 00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.000 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 115 00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:16.080 huda: Maybe like, does this order like this sentence before, where it says, in my rural hometown, Mountain House, California. And when is the power of community support. 116 00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:21.939 huda: Should I put it before the I see beyond surface level problems to the people affected. 117 00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.689 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think before sounds better. 118 00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.110 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can write something abou",
    "t how like 119 00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:33.579 Jenny Duan: people don't always expect that other people are going through these struggles on the outside, but like having gone through something yourself, you're more empathetic. As a result, you can write it in the last paragraph. 120 00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.270 huda: Hmm, yeah, it's a good idea. 121 00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:44.549 Jenny Duan: Because, like some like, maybe it's like, say, some people carry their stories on the outside. Others are like. 122 00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:51.619 Jenny Duan: I don't know, or some you know how like some people are more visible about the problems. And then other people not so much. 123 00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:05.740 huda: We're 124 00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.010 huda: and 125 00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.570 huda: this I don't really like the wording of the sentence, but I just kind of like wrote something down. 126 00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.639 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think this is the right placement. But I think there's probably like a better way. You can phrase this. 127 00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:59.759 huda: like, what's like? The kind of point that I'm trying to get across with the sentence. 128 00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.530 Jenny Duan: That other. Some people are outward about their struggles. Other people are inward about their struggles, and, like 129 00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:13.079 Jenny Duan: you've developed sort of a sense of empathy through going by going through this experience yourself. 130 00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:19.576 huda: So like I don't know how to word it. 131 00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:35.209 huda: Like. I don't want to say like, we don't like the wording that like we don't know what people are going through, because I feel like that's really cliche. 132 00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.550 Jenny Duan: I agree. 133 00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.859 huda: That's kind of like the point. 134 00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:48.199 Jenny Duan: But even a 12 year old 135 00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.980 J",
    "enny Duan: I couldn't make a meaningful difference. 136 00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:13.299 Jenny Duan: Let me write like a bad sentence, and see if I can fix it. 137 00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:23.270 Jenny Duan: I think something like this, like 2 like one or 2 sentences. It's yeah. 138 00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.530 huda: I don't know how this sentence makes sense, but 139 00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.940 huda: I also did like here. 140 00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.569 Jenny Duan: See you. 141 00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.579 Jenny Duan: What does it mean by to see the outward and inward like? Look past the outward. 142 00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.509 huda: Yeah, kind of like to like. 143 00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.710 huda: I learned to 144 00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:11.319 huda: empathize that like even like the inward, like people with inward struggles like sometimes don't express as much like 145 00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:17.170 huda: like kind of like looking deeper into some people, maybe not. Everyday strangers might not be a good example, but 146 00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.470 Jenny Duan: Deeper. 147 00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.910 Jenny Duan: Maybe the pick that. 148 00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.480 huda: Yeah. 149 00:26:39.947 --> 00:26:42.710 huda: I think these could be like, combined somehow, like. 150 00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:43.920 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 151 00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.540 huda: Well. 152 00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.030 huda: yeah, I like that. 153 00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:11.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think that's I. I tried to keep like a game analogy going. Do you feel like it works? Or do you feel like it's like we can also get rid of it. 154 00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.010 huda: I think like 155 00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.760 huda: I think, since there's like 2 references, I think we could just do one. 156 00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, we can get rid of skip this. 157 00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.210 huda: Oh, we're good on word, count.

I kind of want to hear in your voice. 160 00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.330 huda: Yeah. 161 00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:51.639 huda: Picture an aggressive 12 year old, clawing at her ipad, desperate for an elusive fortnight Victory Royale 162 00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:56.219 huda: money was tight, dental visits, now a luxury were paid in installments. 163 00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:06.860 huda: One afternoon our lights suddenly flickered out, my fortnight character jogged in place, my sister's lamp died, plunging her novel into darkness. My brother's nursery rhymes vanished. 164 00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.939 huda: anger morphed into determination. 165 00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:32.240 huda: As a gamer. I'm essentially trained to spot solutions as my parents searched for cash, I fixated on the valiant hero that could rescue us. The crumpled $20 Andrew Jackson I got from Eve weeks earlier. We rushed to the bank, and 30 min later our lights turned on again. What initially felt like sacrificing my gaming dreams revealed something greater that even a 12 year old can make a meaningful difference. 166 00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:37.079 huda: While some people bear their challenges outwards, others fight more invisible quests. 167 00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:54.300 huda: I've developed an understanding and empathy for everyday strangers stories. Now when I develop AI ethics, games, write articles or lead workshops. I carry that same sense of responsibility in my rural Hometown Mountain House, California, I've witnessed the power of community support. 168 00:28:54.300 --> 00:29:09.449 huda: I see beyond surface level problems to the real people affected. Knowing that small actions ripple outward, whether it's helping a family keep their light on or ensuring technology serves humanity ethically, I've learned that ",

I feel like you're done. 175 00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:44.180 Jenny Duan: Is the activities list and everything else kind of the same? Or is it?

Who are you thinking about thinking. 211 00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:16.350 huda: I don't know if it has to be like someone that we know, like personally, because. 212 00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.750 Jenny Duan: Something has to. 213 00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.519 huda: Cause.

Note to the 1st like to the developer of like the 1st game I ever played. 215 00:32:28.157 --> 00:32:29.260 huda: So it's like. 216 00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:41.930 Jenny Duan: Oh, that would be amazing. That's a great idea. I think it has to be like a feasible person. But I don't think it needs to be someone that you know personally like. I don't think you can make say like Hermione Granger from Harry Potter. But if it's a game, if it's like a real person. 217 00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.560 huda: Yeah. 218 00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.360 huda: Oh. 219 00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.510 Jenny Duan: 1st game that you ever played. 220 00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:49.629 huda: No, it was like my, okay.

So, and I think, like. 224 00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:05.789 huda: he just taught me like a lot of things. And like. 225 00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:31.570 huda: definitely inspired me a lot, and like a lot of the things that I do like, even my like the games that I develop like I look at like his games for reference, and like even like he. Also, he's also a writer, obviously so. I read that a lot going up. And then so yeah, right? Like a thank you. Letter to him. And kind of i",
    "f I want to tell a little bit about myself, I can also talk about like how like 226 00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.659 huda: he's influenced like my narrative style, I guess. 227 00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:40.479 Jenny Duan: I think that's perfect. I think you can just do a genuine thank you. I don't think it needs to be 228 00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.090 Jenny Duan: much more than that. Yeah, 229 00:33:46.780 --> 00:34:00.870 Jenny Duan: okay, I don't. I don't know if this needs to be like, I don't think we need to format. I think we, if you just write a very genuine thank you. We can kind of go from there. It's very short. It's only 1 50 to 200 words. So there's not much room anyways. 230 00:34:03.355 --> 00:34:07.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, how will you explore community at Penn? 231 00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.509 Jenny Duan: This is like a Y school, and this is like a Y major. 232 00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:19.139 Jenny Duan: Oh, my, gosh, what? Why? School? Why, department? And why? Major, okay? 233 00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.330 Jenny Duan: Asking Wi-fi questions, what. 234 00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.560 huda: I don't really understand. Like, why there's like 3 separate ones. 235 00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.030 Jenny Duan: I don't know either way. I guess this is more about like social 236 00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:45.230 Jenny Duan: clubs, and this is like a hit. This is a diversity essay hidden in a Y school essay because they're saying like how your experience and perspectives will help shape Penn. So this is like this is their version of a diversity essay. So 237 00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:51.320 Jenny Duan: I would definitely talk about Muslim identity. You can talk about like 238 00:34:51.409 --> 00:35:06.180 Jenny Duan: women in games here. Your involvement in that organization. We can talk about. Maybe, like women in Cs organizations that's bleeding a bit into the pre-professional. But it's fine Indian heritage and rural background. 239 00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:07.750 huda: Okay. 240 0",
    "0:35:07.750 --> 00:35:20.250 Jenny Duan: Like you're you have a. You have a couple of essays that you've written for different schools about like the the trees in Mount House, California. So I think you can use an adaptation of that essay. 241 00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.450 huda: Yeah. 242 00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.940 Jenny Duan: What type of trees are they? 243 00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.740 huda: Almond trees. 244 00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.640 Jenny Duan: Of the almond trees. Essay. Yeah. 245 00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:35.340 Jenny Duan: I think if you just adapt, like one of those essays that you've written, you should be good for this one. It's like, pretty much the same thing, I think. 246 00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.750 Jenny Duan: Okay, so just yeah, and I think everything else. 247 00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.960 Jenny Duan: Yeah, did. The director of the pro. Actually, did the director ever respond to you? I know it's 248 00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:52.340 Jenny Duan: Thanksgiving. Okay, it's fine, I think. Give it a little bit more time. 249 00:35:53.513 --> 00:36:01.590 Jenny Duan: And then, did these essays? Do you have any questions about how to write them or your process? 250 00:36:02.468 --> 00:36:07.071 huda: No, I think I'll I'll try and come up with an idea, or like 251 00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.160 huda: I mean, I guess this one I already have an idea. But like 252 00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.729 huda: I'm just trying to figure out how I'll be able to stretch it out to like 6 50 words. 253 00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.500 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's super long. It's another common episode. 254 00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.899 huda: All common fs, if it's like a lot. 255 00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.369 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then have you started thinking more about your portfolio and what you're gonna put together for that. 256 00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:35.290 huda: I'm not really sure cause, it said, like one of the requirements was like a 3D. Like model, and. 257 00:36:35.730 -",
    "-> 00:36:38.029 Jenny Duan: Does it require a 3D. Model or. 258 00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.020 huda: Gotcha. 259 00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.130 Jenny Duan: Recommended. 260 00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.580 huda: Let's see 261 00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.850 huda: it said. 262 00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:08.190 huda: At least one drawing in physical medium, at least 1 3D. Composition. 263 00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.520 huda: and then, like like the game, is. 264 00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.580 huda: is like additional like if you want to, but like the art and the 265 00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:26.690 huda: the art and the 3D. Composition are like mandatory, apparently so. 266 00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.429 Jenny Duan: So 3D. Composition. 267 00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.930 huda: Remember, I think like the last time I did that was in like 268 00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.849 huda: middle school, so I don't know. 269 00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:36.890 huda: Hmm! 270 00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:39.950 huda: Done it. 271 00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.830 Jenny Duan: Digital or or physical. 272 00:37:43.005 --> 00:37:43.690 huda: Digital. 273 00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.780 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's fine. I think you can do Blender. 274 00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.749 Jenny Duan: You can look up a blender tutorial and make your own from that. 275 00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.370 huda: Yeah. 276 00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.590 Jenny Duan: Do you have blender on your computer. 277 00:37:54.416 --> 00:37:56.699 huda: I'll probably just download it. 278 00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.700 Jenny Duan: I've made some blender art before. It's actually kind of fun. It does take a long time. 279 00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.060 Jenny Duan: Hello. 280 00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.884 huda: I mean, like a donut in like middle school, but then, like. 281 00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.130 Jenny Duan: Okay, I did this before. 282 00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:30.019 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, it's fine. I've made this before. It shouldn't take you too long. I",
    " think this would be like a good project for the next couple of days. Go to Youtube, look up a blender tutorial, and then find, like some different find, a couple of different tutorials. For example, you can make a scene that's like. 283 00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:40.380 Jenny Duan: let's just take the donut as an example. You don't use this as an example, but like you can find like a donut, and then like an ice cream, and then like a couple of other things, and then just like, put them all together in one scene. 284 00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:55.389 Jenny Duan: so it doesn't look like too much like you're copying just the tutorial like. Don't make an exact same from the tutorial like. Make the objects, and then learn how to put in some effects like snow or something, and then, just like, put it in. That's what I did for my Blender assignment at school I took a class on Blender. 285 00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.590 huda: Cool. 286 00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.649 Jenny Duan: So yeah, I think that's what would be good. 287 00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 288 00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:18.180 Jenny Duan: I think I don't think this should be the barrier. I think that should be fine for the next like it will take you like a week to probably do. But I would say it's important to submit a digital portfolio, so you get a chance to show them your game. 289 00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:19.670 huda: Yeah. 290 00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.400 Jenny Duan: And 291 00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.780 Jenny Duan: and I think for this interest aligned. Let's talk a little bit more about this essay, because I think 292 00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:32.599 Jenny Duan: with 650 words. It can't just be like, I want this because, Xyz, I think you have to write a story for this. 293 00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.330 huda: Yeah. 294 00:39:33.593 --> 00:39:40.169 Jenny Duan: But this is like pretty much just your common app, like I feel like your common app is just already good enough for this prompt. 295 00:39:40.41",
    "0 --> 00:39:41.340 huda: Yeah. 296 00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:46.449 Jenny Duan: I don't quite understand. Okay, if you were to write another common app, what would you write it about? 297 00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.190 huda: Like, okay? So since it's like, still about games, maybe like. 298 00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:07.360 huda: like, maybe I can pick one aspect of like my personal statement that like, for example, I don't. I don't know if I 299 00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:12.379 huda: I talked about like a couple things about video games, but I think like, if I talk about like the 300 00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.919 huda: I don't think rule switching would really match the. 301 00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.780 Jenny Duan: Oh! 302 00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.759 huda: Purpose of this essay. But 303 00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.520 huda: maybe like I can talk about like 304 00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.450 huda: the 1st game to ever exist. 305 00:40:33.001 --> 00:40:37.119 huda: Cause like games aren't just like video games. And like. 306 00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.159 huda: So I could talk about like 307 00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:49.850 huda: like a historic game that was like the 1st game to ever exist. And maybe like, talk about like, how like gaming has evolved from there and like how maybe 308 00:40:50.383 --> 00:40:55.980 huda: I don't know how to like make this like specifically like personal, but like, like 309 00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:09.640 huda: about how that historic video game has changed throughout the years with new developments like technology and like, now mixing in media like, now, VR, so like, maybe that kind of approach. 310 00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.159 Jenny Duan: Okay, that would be good. 311 00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.671 Jenny Duan: Another thing that I was thinking about is 312 00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:25.410 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can talk about like cause this is like a computer graphics type of like, that's what the focus of the program is about 313 00:41:26.123 --> 00:41",
    ":34.860 Jenny Duan: to my understanding. And then other things on top of that. But maybe you can talk about like recreations of real world things in Minecraft, and like 314 00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.009 Jenny Duan: how we went from like. 315 00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.319 Jenny Duan: I think you should go a little bit deeper into the computer graphics aspect of it. 316 00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.420 Jenny Duan: To demonstrate like your knowledge and interest in this area. 317 00:41:50.510 --> 00:42:05.520 Jenny Duan: So maybe you can go from like how each pixel, like it, used to carry only this amount of information. But now, like computer imaging, technology, has gone so much more advanced that we can depict like these certain scenes with computer graphics that we weren't able to do before. 318 00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.728 Jenny Duan: even though I know, like, computer graphics are not your 319 00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.990 Jenny Duan: like, that's not exactly what you want to do. But 320 00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.710 Jenny Duan: that's what the major is focused about. 321 00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:24.845 Jenny Duan: because it says like, it combines major coursework in computer graphics and Fine Arts courses within Penn's 322 00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:32.740 Jenny Duan: School of Design. The program was created in 1998 to educate a new generation of people to work in computer graphics. 323 00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.759 Jenny Duan: So I think, whatever your essay is about. 324 00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:42.409 Jenny Duan: emphasize, like the graphics part. And you might need to do a little bit of more research onto what that entails. But I think like 325 00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:49.269 Jenny Duan: getting into like, why, computer graphics specifically is important to you because these people are gonna know, like. 326 00:42:49.550 --> 00:43:13.940 Jenny Duan: obviously, you are applying for this program. But, like in the context of your pen application, they need to know, like, ",
    "why are you doing this program and not Usc's games program like, what's the difference between pursuing a major in games and a music major in computer graphics like, yes, they can lead to the same outcome. But like, it's still a slightly different pursuit. So you should tailor this essay to like the study of computer graphics more so than just games in and of itself. 327 00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:14.630 huda: Yeah. 328 00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.400 Jenny Duan: That's what this major focuses on. 329 00:43:20.686 --> 00:43:21.939 Jenny Duan: So yeah. 330 00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:28.459 Jenny Duan: I think that the say that you suggested is great. My suggestion is, can maybe talk about like 331 00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.999 Jenny Duan: Minecraft depictions of real world buildings. But you don't need to do that like 332 00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:39.776 Jenny Duan: an example of this would be like, maybe like talking about 333 00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:49.263 Jenny Duan: I don't know what's like a relevant like the 334 00:43:50.380 --> 00:44:18.829 Jenny Duan: like the I don't. I don't know like the how to pronounce this, but like the Al Kaba, like in a Mecca like something like that. And how people are building like really cool things all in Minecraft, and how that's like a connection to culture community. And you could talk about Mountain House, California, your high school, like some people in high school like they made digital problems on Minecraft or Roblox, or something. So that's like one thing you could talk about. But I don't think it exactly matters as long as it's 335 00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:22.169 Jenny Duan: you weave in the computer imaging and graphics aspect. 336 00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:30.410 Jenny Duan: Okay, what's the next school on your list? I think we can put that next school for next time. But 337 00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.044 Jenny Duan: I just wanna know what's the next school? 338 00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.250 huda: Me, too. 339 00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.67",
    "0 huda: It's Carnegie Mellon. 340 00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.590 Jenny Duan: Okay. 341 00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:51.880 Jenny Duan: So the next time we, I think you should take some time this week and do your blender thing for the Upenn portfolio. So next steps are, submit the Mit application 342 00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:58.680 Jenny Duan: draft the Upen essays, and then spend some time and work on that blender portfolio thing 343 00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.539 Jenny Duan: for Upen. When do you want to meet next. 344 00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:06.500 Jenny Duan: or when do you think you'll be able to have like good progress on these things? 345 00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.330 huda: I think. Tuesday, maybe. 346 00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.340 Jenny Duan: Tuesday. Okay. 347 00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:13.590 Jenny Duan: Sounds great. 348 00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.249 Jenny Duan: Is there a certain time on Tuesday that. 349 00:45:19.195 --> 00:45:20.320 huda: Just 7 Pm. 350 00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:21.710 Jenny Duan: What? 351 00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.279 huda: The 7 Pm. Work. 352 00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.500 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's great, I know. 353 00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.460 Jenny Duan: Okay, then I'll see you on at 7 pm. 354 00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:32.710 Jenny Duan: On Tuesday. 355 00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.020 huda: Alright, great. 356 00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.680 Jenny Duan: Oh, alright! Talk to you then. 357 00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:39.389 huda: See you soon. Bye. 358 00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.200 Jenny Duan: Bye."
