How's it going? 2 00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.760 Jenny Duan: Hello! 3 00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.500 Jenny Duan: Hi! Huda! Can you hear me? 4 00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.390 huda: Hi! 5 00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.839 Jenny Duan: There we go. How's it going. 6 00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.059 huda: It's going good. How are you? 7 00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:53.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm pretty good. This week has just been passing by so quickly. I'm going to la this weekend. So I'm like, really excited to be in Socal. But yeah, trying to get ahead on work before I have to leave. 8 00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:06.499 Jenny Duan: yeah, I love your U.S.A, sub. I mean not your U.S.A, your usc supplementals? I've taken a look at them briefly. Can you walk me through like the changes that you've made? 9 00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.520 Jenny Duan: I see that you filled in like these 2 50 word essays. But what else have you changed beyond these. 10 00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:40.690 huda: So for the short answers. The 1st one I kind of came up with a couple like different options, for like which 3 words I can describe myself with. I was actually looking at a couple examples. And there's like some really creative ones like I think someone said like crazy cat lady. And I thought I was like really creative. So I wanted to do something kind of like funny in a way as well. So then I came up with like a couple ideas like Try fuelled gamer 11 00:05:41.033 --> 00:06:00.970 huda: and then try fueled gamer and epistem epistemophilic, which means like the love of knowledge. And then the other ones like kind of the same thing, except with polymath, which kind of just means that, like I do like a whole bunch of things which I guess is pretty relevant because I'm I feel like I. 12 00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.650 Jenny Duan: I think you muted yourself accidentally. 13 00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.534 huda: Oh, 14 00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:17.990 huda: yeah, it's kind of interdisciplinary. Like my background. So yeah, that's what I went with like these couple options. But I honestly feel like 15 00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.150 huda: the least wordy one is be. But yeah, I don't know 16 00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:39.450 huda: And then for number 2, I just came up with like another another response. It's another Indian food, Panipuri, and then I just like, added a little comment like strategies, everything. So it's kind of like. 17 00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I like, I like the B better because I feel like it tells you more about, tells them more about how you think. 18 00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.160 huda: Hmm. 19 00:06:46.998 --> 00:07:12.319 huda: and then here I kind of I came up with like another movie which I think is really good. It's animated. It's Ralph breaks the Internet and then I guess I kind of related that to like like code like me coding and like how I also break the Internet with like my code, I guess. But then, yeah, I don't know which wording sounds better. But yeah, I added, like a more funny twist to it, I guess. 20 00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.430 huda: I 21 00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.450 huda: I kind of like the second one. I'm not sure 22 00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.679 huda: And then I also, for for dream job 23 00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:56.920 huda: I had like 2 options as well for that one. I'm also like, really indecisive with this. But yeah, like this one was like the one that we kind of like planned out, which is like, why choose one wordle data. Analyst meets a tech game developer and turning, learn to green squares. Kind of like a wordle reference. And then the second one is like 24 00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:05.430 huda: a little less descriptive, I think, but it's designing games that secretly teach stem topics like hiding veggies in a pizza 25 00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:23.319 huda: and then theme song. I think we already talked about this, but it's theme from New York, New York, by Frank Sinatra and like one of the quotes, is small town blues are fading or melting away. So then, yeah, I just kind of just that. I think this last sentence is a bit like like this bit is kind of like. I don't know if it's 26 00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.860 huda: like if I should change it. But 27 00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:37.900 huda: And then this one, like, I think I have room for more characters. But I kind of got the point across like I want to visit, like 1957 India 28 00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.749 huda: and then the reasons just like 29 00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:46.970 huda: to get like my grandmother's recipe. And I didn't really add any reasoning, I think, for squid game season 2, but 30 00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:54.530 huda: I probably should. And then same thing with like the roommate and favorite book one and then 31 00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:09.840 huda: for like the class teaching a class, I came up with like 2 ideas, and one of them was about like being like an introvert and like creating change. So the introverts cookbook recipes for success without small talk is the main ingredient. 32 00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:19.900 huda: and the second one is algorithmic nostalgia, 101 preserving cultural heritage through computational archives. 33 00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.850 huda: Oh, I think you're muted. 34 00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:50.999 Jenny Duan: Whoops. Okay, I was. Gonna say, I think, let's start with this 2 50 word essay. And we actually let's start with the short answers, and then we can go to the long answers after that. But I think we can start finalizing some of these short answers today. 35 00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.089 Jenny Duan: or do you want to start with something different. 36 00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.329 huda: No, I think this this that sounds great. 37 00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:03.400 Jenny Duan: Okay, I like this Trifield gamer, Trifield, gamer, epistemophilic. I feel like 38 00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:13.699 Jenny Duan: this is fun, because I actually like the long word here. I feel like, because Chi Field is like personality based. Gamer is like also personalities, descriptor. And then I think this is more like. 39 00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.300 Jenny Duan: so how you think. And I, and I like the long word here. I feel like it's good. 40 00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:27.240 Jenny Duan: This. So I think this one. I feel good about this answer, finalized this one. I feel good about this finalized now I think 41 00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.350 Jenny Duan: here. 42 00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.388 Jenny Duan: I like Ralph breaks the Internet. 43 00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.680 Jenny Duan: but I don't. I don't think this sounds smooth. 44 00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.340 huda: Yeah. 45 00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.210 Jenny Duan: Maybe like 46 00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.269 Jenny Duan: like, I'm not sure if the reader would understand 47 00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.699 Jenny Duan: like, why do you break your code every day? Isn't that the point to like. 48 00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:59.549 Jenny Duan: not break your code. Or I I mean, I get that. The point is to break your code. But like or to keep coding, which breaks your code. But like, can you elaborate? Why, breaking your code is important. 49 00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.859 Jenny Duan: We're white. Is that every day. 50 00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:09.169 huda: Like when you're like implementing new features. There's like things that you don't know. And it's like trying by experimentation. I guess. 51 00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.079 Jenny Duan: Okay, can you emphasize that here? How many words do you have for each of these. 52 00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.079 huda: It's a hundred characters. 53 00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.890 Jenny Duan: When for each of these. 54 00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.540 huda: Yeah. 55 00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.660 Jenny Duan: Okay. 56 00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.013 huda: So this is already kind of like, it's 93 characters. So. 57 00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:45.310 Jenny Duan: Because this seems like, like, I don't see the intention behind. Why, you break your code here, and I feel like that's important in the context of this mistake. 58 00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.149 huda: Should I say, like experiment with my code. 59 00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.380 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 60 00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.210 huda: This is 116 characters. 61 00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:54.909 huda: Maybe I don't need the bugs, for I could just say, like experiment, experiment with my code. But hey? I fix them eventually. 62 00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.400 Jenny Duan: How does that connect? How does that connect to the movie. 63 00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:13.189 Jenny Duan: I feel like the connection here is that, like Ralph is breaking the Internet, and you are breaking code. And I feel like that is an important analogy, but I'm just trying to figure out how I can make that fit a little bit better. 64 00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.500 Jenny Duan: see. 65 00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:56.170 huda: Maybe like instead, like Ralph breaks the Internet and instead of emphasizing, like how I create bugs, I can focus on like how I debug, debug, my code. 66 00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 67 00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.484 huda: So. 68 00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.060 Jenny Duan: Like, okay, let me look up this movie because I wonder if there's 69 00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.289 Jenny Duan: like a specific visual imagery we can create. Yeah. 70 00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.769 Jenny Duan: this is great. 71 00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.500 Jenny Duan: I love that. I think that this is good. 72 00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:48.740 Jenny Duan: Guess I'm not the only one constantly debugging. Okay, I feel like this tone. This tone is much better than the last one, much more focused on, like 73 00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.240 Jenny Duan: I don't know on 74 00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.100 Jenny Duan: the bugs rather than like your process of debugging them, which is what we wanted to have. 75 00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.380 Jenny Duan: Okay 76 00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.670 Jenny Duan: in debugging great 77 00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.040 Jenny Duan: dream job. 78 00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:28.080 Jenny Duan: Okay? I think for this one I want to avoid like this specific game, because by the time you're working. You don't know if Wordle is still going to be as popular. You might love Wordle, but it might not be like the It game. There might be something new and and better. And you you want your job to be something that like has longevity in the future, not just something that's like trending right now. 79 00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.850 huda: Yeah. 80 00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:47.549 Jenny Duan: So. And I also want to avoid mentioning, like a specific game or specific something that's not like an established cultural icon, because I feel like Wordle is still too new. It's new enough to still be considered like a fad. And so you don't want to place your dream job over something that's like, maybe temporary for other people. 81 00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:50.770 Jenny Duan: So 82 00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.819 Jenny Duan: is there another way you could write this 83 00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.360 Jenny Duan: like something meets a tech game developer turning learn into something. 84 00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.739 Jenny Duan: Or I guess the turning learn is a word all specific rest, reference. But. 85 00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.689 huda: Yeah, I think maybe like. 86 00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.129 huda: I could just do like data journalist. Maybe. 87 00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.670 Jenny Duan: Okay. 88 00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.379 Jenny Duan: maybe you can say something like translating. 89 00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.080 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 90 00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.079 Jenny Duan: translating. 91 00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.030 huda: Like 92 00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.540 huda: statistics to 93 00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.130 huda: or actually, I don't know. 94 00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.160 huda: like. 95 00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.260 Jenny Duan: Data point. 96 00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.619 Jenny Duan: translating 97 00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.110 Jenny Duan: data points into 98 00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.520 Jenny Duan: interactive stories 99 00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.730 Jenny Duan: translating 100 00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:18.740 Jenny Duan: from 101 00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.090 Jenny Duan: okay. 102 00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.730 huda: Hmm. 103 00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.629 huda: maybe like telling stories and 104 00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.590 huda: translating statistics simultaneously. 105 00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.669 Jenny Duan: Say that one more time. 106 00:18:35.832 --> 00:18:40.410 huda: Maybe like translating statistics and telling stories simultaneously. 107 00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.979 Jenny Duan: think that works 108 00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.670 Jenny Duan: or 109 00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:56.839 Jenny Duan: I want to see. I want to see, like the connection between data journalism and game developing. 110 00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:09.860 Jenny Duan: And I feel like doing them at the same time is, isn't the same thing as like being a data journalist meets because I think the key word here is like meets a tech game developers. So how are you? Somehow, both same time. 111 00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.769 huda: And I think this kind of sums it. But like 112 00:19:14.188 --> 00:19:17.779 huda: I guess, like, in a way, also like teaching 113 00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.369 huda: teaching like stem related topics through interactive stories. 114 00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like this is oops. I feel like this reads fine to me. Let me look at the 115 00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.240 Jenny Duan: word count on here. 116 00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, a hundred 11. 117 00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.649 huda: Oh, okay, it says 110. So. 118 00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.650 Jenny Duan: I included the period at the end. 119 00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.759 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, with the space with them. So 120 00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.769 Jenny Duan: yeah. 110. 121 00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.200 huda: Maybe like y, or just one. 122 00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 123 00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:40.910 huda: 2 letters. 124 00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.650 Jenny Duan: How's that? 125 00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.860 huda: Oh, yeah, that's perfectly 100. Yeah. 126 00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.489 Jenny Duan: Let's do that. 127 00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.865 Jenny Duan: Okay. 128 00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.920 Jenny Duan: see here. 129 00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.570 Jenny Duan: if you had a theme song, what would it be? 130 00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.749 Jenny Duan: I think this is good, except we're let's just 131 00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.190 Jenny Duan: fix this like I'm bringing big change. 132 00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.750 huda: Hmm, bye. 133 00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.170 Jenny Duan: Everything else is fine 134 00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.319 Jenny Duan: is I'm bringing big change. A line from the song. 135 00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:41.080 huda: I don't think so. Wait. 136 00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:51.910 huda: No. 137 00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.470 huda: maybe like 138 00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.650 huda: like 139 00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.099 huda: the stench of a farm can't stop me, or something. 140 00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.029 Jenny Duan: I don't know if I would say that, but 141 00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.179 Jenny Duan: I would say 142 00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.480 Jenny Duan: I'm good 143 00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.870 Jenny Duan: something like that. 144 00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.090 huda: Hmm! I think the multi one was part of like the lyrics. That's why I kept it. But. 145 00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.060 Jenny Duan: Oh. 146 00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.460 Jenny Duan: maybe I would do it like this then, just to denote that they're familiar. 147 00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.769 huda: And I'll also put this to them. 148 00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.799 huda: Yeah, that fits. Then 149 00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.080 huda: great. 150 00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.070 Jenny Duan: Hello! 151 00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.979 Jenny Duan: I think maybe we could change this dream trip, because. 152 00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:41.282 Jenny Duan: in my opinion, 153 00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.469 Jenny Duan: in my opinion, this 154 00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.440 Jenny Duan: one 155 00:23:51.700 --> 00:24:00.509 Jenny Duan: feels like it's I think you talk a lot about culture like, for example, in this Chai field here in Panipuri. And I don't know if you need to 156 00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.450 Jenny Duan: reference that again. I mean, I think it's like 157 00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:11.250 Jenny Duan: I think it's valuable, but I don't know if it adds anything new to about you. 158 00:24:13.335 --> 00:24:15.700 Jenny Duan: But open to hear your thoughts on this. 159 00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:23.489 huda: Yeah, I agree. I think I mentioned a couple of times I mean, like another like way I was like thinking of approaching it, which is 160 00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:45.280 huda: kind of related to culture. But it's also like another thing like I was thinking of like saying, like 1957, India, where I can tell like the stories my grandparents never got to, or something like that like. So it's kind of related to like my storytelling aspect. But so kind of the same, but I think like. 161 00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.799 huda: but we should do something else like that's also fine. 162 00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.709 Jenny Duan: What's the something else that you? 163 00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.160 Jenny Duan: I guess like. What if you could just 164 00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.190 Jenny Duan: think about where else you would travel? Where else would you go? 165 00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.520 huda: And 166 00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.170 huda: maybe like 167 00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:20.859 huda: like I mean, this is just kind of like not really related to me. But I want to go to turkey to see like the architecture there. But 168 00:25:22.024 --> 00:25:25.319 huda: I guess that doesn't really say much about me in the essay. 169 00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:32.029 Jenny Duan: What? What? Why do you want to see the architecture? I feel like that could be the. 170 00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:38.392 huda: I mean, like, there's like history, like a lot of history behind each of them. And then, like 171 00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.049 huda: I mean, it's just like really pretty. But 172 00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.110 huda: I could also like 173 00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:52.430 huda: travel back to when like the 1st video game was created. But 174 00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.060 huda: I don't know if that's like 175 00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.210 huda: relevant to the prompt. 176 00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.960 Jenny Duan: I mean anything that you can use like 177 00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.609 Jenny Duan: turkey. If you talked about that, it would highlight like your sense of adventure and curiosity, for the world which I feel like 178 00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.990 Jenny Duan: is important, too, in and of itself. 179 00:26:15.862 --> 00:26:19.399 Jenny Duan: But I feel like for your dream trip. 180 00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.190 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 181 00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.730 Jenny Duan: What else is important to you that you feel like you haven't shown on your application yet. 182 00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.590 huda: I don't think 183 00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.240 huda: I've 184 00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.650 huda: I feel like I'd 185 00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.160 huda: kind of briefly mentioned, like 186 00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.500 huda: like journalism and filmmaking. 187 00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.140 huda: hmm. 188 00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.940 huda: And also. 189 00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:09.679 huda: yeah, I don't think I mentioned like like journalism at all. Besides, like data journalism. 190 00:27:15.894 --> 00:27:22.480 Jenny Duan: Okay. So maybe where's 1 place where you would go to tell the stories of people? Is it India, or is it anywhere else? 191 00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.260 huda: I mean, there's like a lot of places 192 00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.043 huda: and like 193 00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.109 huda: I don't really know how to answer this. 194 00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.699 huda: I mean, I think, yeah, like in India. 195 00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.770 huda: seeing like 196 00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.960 huda: oh, like almost, I feel like I'm going back into the culture part. But like 197 00:27:53.410 --> 00:28:01.100 huda: like almost every family, has, like a partition story, and so like. I think it would be really interesting to report like all of those. 198 00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.280 huda: But 199 00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.340 huda: no, no. 200 00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.879 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! Can you try to distill that into a response. 201 00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.269 huda: Yeah. But also like, I don't know if that also again, like 202 00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.259 huda: delves back into like the cultural aspect. 203 00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.269 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think it's fine to write about culture, if, if like, that's what you're most interested in, because 204 00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:26.990 Jenny Duan: you do want it to be genuine to you, and so like, are there any other stories that you would want to tell? Besides that that you feel like are meaningful to you? 205 00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:48.849 huda: I mean, like kind of circling back to like tech obsession, I think like. 206 00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.560 huda: oh, maybe telling like the story of like 207 00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.700 huda: like Ada Lovelace, which I know she's like like heavily covered now. 208 00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.660 huda: but like a lot of people don't know like how like her personal life was. 209 00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.090 huda: and also like 210 00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.989 huda: like how much of a contribution she made to like tech 211 00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.670 huda: and I think that's like one of those stories. But then I feel like again, that might be a little basic. 212 00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.400 huda: So. 213 00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:49.990 Jenny Duan: Okay, what is what is a place that you genuinely want to travel to? I feel like for this question. Maybe they're just asking also for a straightforward answer, because they want to know, like what you're interested in. For example, like some people are interested in archaeology, and so they might want to go to ancient Greece. Some people are interested in like music, so they might want to go to Vienna like it might just be a place that you're interested in, because you like the architecture, and that's like super valid. Or if there's like a specific city that you would want to go to for, and just like a personal interest and curiosity. 214 00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:58.920 huda: Yeah. Then, in that case it would probably be like Turkey. Like Istanbul, or like 215 00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:04.920 huda: even Florence, Italy like that. It's like a really beautiful place. 216 00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:09.860 huda: yeah. 217 00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:20.010 Jenny Duan: Something that's interesting about Turkey that you could write about is Turkey is kind of like the intersection between, like the Eastern and Western worlds, and I feel like that creates for an interesting like cultural fusion. 218 00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.080 Jenny Duan: Oh. 219 00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.450 Jenny Duan: so maybe like that could be something you write about. 220 00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.899 huda: Actually like I don't know how to. I don't know how to word it. 221 00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.520 huda: and 222 00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.649 huda: that's the grand, the grand bizarre. 223 00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.870 huda: Maybe they're mentioning that 224 00:31:22.065 --> 00:31:26.570 huda: wait like. So wait. What am I supposed to talk about after I'd say like, what place. 225 00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:34.210 Jenny Duan: Why you want to visit Istanbul. Why does that stand out as a place that is special in some way for you? 226 00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.330 Jenny Duan: Okay. 227 00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.390 huda: Maybe like, yeah. 228 00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:02.889 Jenny Duan: This is, this is good. 229 00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.090 huda: Alright! 230 00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.669 Jenny Duan: I would say, to see the cultures blend. Let's be a little bit more specific. 231 00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.929 Jenny Duan: Something like that, maybe, or like 232 00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.410 Jenny Duan: same 233 00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.160 Jenny Duan: the password of the Eastern or West. 234 00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:17.790 Jenny Duan: like I'm trying to. I'm trying to connect this to journalism in some way, and be like Istanbul, is a crossroads between the East and the West like, how did how were stories exchanged during the in this place 235 00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.140 Jenny Duan: like. 236 00:33:19.531 --> 00:33:23.840 huda: Let me see if there's a specific like historical instance, about 237 00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.399 huda: less than 1,000. 238 00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:36.519 Jenny Duan: Not quite perfect. 239 00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.009 Jenny Duan: getting closer. 240 00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.659 huda: Hmm! 241 00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.398 huda: Maybe like where each like mosaic lamp 242 00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.989 huda: like has a story. Maybe. 243 00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.830 Jenny Duan: What does that mean? Exactly. 244 00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.870 huda: Like so turkey's like known, for like the mosaic glimpse 245 00:35:03.653 --> 00:35:04.999 huda: and like. 246 00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.070 huda: I guess 247 00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:17.699 huda: it's kind of interesting that like each shard is like, because in each shard of the like the lamp, it's like they're all like vastly different, like, they look really different. So like they probably have like different 248 00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.499 huda: stories. I guess if I'm looking too deep into it. But 249 00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:29.060 huda: yeah, I don't. Don't think that really matches with like the East and West. Theme. 250 00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:08.980 Jenny Duan: Maybe something like that. 251 00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.040 huda: Oh, yeah. So store stories. 252 00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.880 Jenny Duan: Oh, stories, not stores, sorry. 253 00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.200 huda: Okay. 254 00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.090 Jenny Duan: 100 characters. 255 00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.100 Jenny Duan: Question mark 256 00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.069 Jenny Duan: for 99 characters. 257 00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.690 huda: Okay, that's perfect. It's a hundred. Yeah. 258 00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:31.550 Jenny Duan: Great. 259 00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:41.119 Jenny Duan: Okay? Let's write about why you're gonna binge binge, watch squid game season 2, and I'll be binge watching it with you. But why are you? Why are you binge watching this. 260 00:36:42.117 --> 00:36:43.039 huda: I think like 261 00:36:43.700 --> 00:37:02.079 huda: well, for one like the last seasons like cliffhanger was really good, and I've been like waiting for like 2 years, I think for it to come out, and then I guess, like on a deeper level, like the filmmaking is like also really great and like it reveals a lot about like, how 262 00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.970 huda: like about like how humans act 263 00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.360 huda: when like 264 00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.609 huda: in like a life or death situation like it's really telling. 265 00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:16.270 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And also like it's, it requires so much critical thinking, because you're literally playing games with 266 00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.940 Jenny Duan: yourself. I guess. 267 00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.510 Jenny Duan: Oh! 268 00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:26.029 huda: So I don't know which aspects I should focus on like if I wanted to do something quirky. It could be like like 269 00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:32.039 huda: I've been on the edge of my seat for the past 2 years from that last cliffhanger actually, like. 270 00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.630 Jenny Duan: Doesn't add any information about you. 271 00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:35.830 huda: Hmm! 272 00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.540 huda: And 273 00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.720 huda: maybe like. 274 00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:14.549 huda: maybe, like, I can say like what I would do if I was like in a life or death situation like squid games, which I mean like. I don't think it would be necessarily true, but I could just say something like how I like de-stress, which is like through journaling, which I don't think I don't think it's like 275 00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.339 huda: really accurate for the situation. But 276 00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.520 huda: that might be like one way I can incorporate like how it's related to me I don't know. 277 00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.140 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 278 00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.640 Jenny Duan: let's see. 279 00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:55.240 Jenny Duan: maybe you could write about something something interesting about, like the intricacies of the game, or like like creative problem solving. 280 00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.710 huda: Hmm 281 00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.080 huda: maybe 282 00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:11.770 huda: hmm. 283 00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 284 00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.310 Jenny Duan: no. 285 00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:03.510 Jenny Duan: What? What's 1 detail about sweet game season, one that like stands out to you, or that you remember quite clearly. 286 00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.229 huda: I remember like 287 00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.809 huda: like kind of how 288 00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:14.279 huda: I guess it like 289 00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.599 huda: in squid game. One like 290 00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:34.540 huda: a lot of themes were like tied into it, like, for example, like even like misogyny, was like tied into it somehow, like with like the behavior towards like the female. People in the squid games. And then there's like a lot of aspects like that like 291 00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.309 huda: which are really telling. But I think 292 00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.319 huda: like one thing that really stood out was 293 00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.450 huda: on 294 00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:58.269 huda: like this one scene where, like there's like a bunch I mean, like, I don't know if this is too like graphic, but like there's like one scene where there's like a bunch of people getting eliminated. But there was like happy music playing, which was like. 295 00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:05.290 huda: I don't know, just like the filmmaking was really really well done, because it's like really unexpected. 296 00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.633 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 297 00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.969 Jenny Duan: we could do like. 298 00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.309 Jenny Duan: how does squid game season 2 like. 299 00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:33.269 Jenny Duan: reflect something about you? Or what? What? If anything, does it show 300 00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.510 Jenny Duan: for your lives. 301 00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:52.789 huda: I mean, I think in the second season, like the guy who wins he actually goes back to the squid games, I think like that was like how like ended up, but like. 302 00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:53.380 Jenny Duan: No. 303 00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:00.840 huda: I guess like, and I don't know if I'm reading too much into it. But it's almost kind of like he's continuing back 304 00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.010 huda: like 305 00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:11.970 huda: this might be a reach, but like how like? After I was done learning like like cs and stuff. I kind of went back to try and help 306 00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:20.359 huda: others teach. So like, I don't know, like, I don't know how to make that connection. But yeah, I guess like Season 2 shows like he's going back. 307 00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.040 huda: I don't know if he's going back to like support others, but 308 00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.500 huda: hmm! 309 00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:50.640 Jenny Duan: I feel like what's most powerful about squid game that you can connect to your life is how it's solving games. And it's thinking about real life in like a series of puzzles. Maybe you can say some like, I feel like, that's what's valuable about switch games, is it? Shows these very human emotions in like a gamified or puzzling way.

I feel like that's really important. And it's a key aspect of your application. Because, like through journalism, through data, through stories in general, you, you hope to like make a change in other people. And I feel like this is a good example of how that's changing you as a person. 444 00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:40.760 Jenny Duan: What do you think? Is there a way that you could condense all of that down to 445 00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.250 Jenny Duan: a hundred characters only. 446 00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:48.629 huda: Also, I don't think we need to put the offer. I think I. 447 00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:50.469 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I don't think so either. 448 01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.020 huda: maybe like 449 01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:12.110 huda: sparked my empathy in. 450 01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.830 huda: Oh, like wait!

Maybe. 458 01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.989 Jenny Duan: like how individual stories inspire empathy. 459 01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:03.399 huda: Okay, I'm just gonna write something. But 460 01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.820 huda: and. 461 01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:17.630 Jenny Duan: It's okay. You can write all your thoughts down. We can condense it. It's it's okay. It doesn't have to be perfect with it. With the 1st draft. 462 01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:49.620 huda: Yeah, I don't. I don't like the wording of this at all. But 463 01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.470 huda: hmm. 464 01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:57.160 Jenny Duan: That's a hundred characters. But I don't know about all of this. 465 01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.079 Jenny Duan: I don't know about this last line. If it's necessary. 466 01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:03.880 huda: Hmm, 467 01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:16.540 huda: I I think it's important, because, like, like you said, it's like a big part of like my extracurriculars and my profile as well. 468 01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:19.910 huda: yeah, I'll see if I could like. 469 01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:23.910 huda: like, maybe 470 01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.369 huda: yeah, like word it 471 01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.430 huda: in different way, maybe. 472 01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.279 huda: But yeah, for now I think this is a good. 473 01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.019 Jenny Duan: I think. Yeah, for now it's good you can. We can revisit it if we need to. 474 01:05:36.855 --> 01:05:40.829 Jenny Duan: I wanna come back to this, if you could teach a class on any topic 475 01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.679 Jenny Duan: would be 476 01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:49.989 Jenny Duan: okay. I don't think either of these quite make sense. 477 01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:53.759 Jenny Duan: I think, because number one, it's not exactly clear like 478 01:05:53.980 --> 01:06:16.280 Jenny Duan: what department your class would be in like, is it a? It's not a cooking class. It's not like a public speaking class. It would be kind of unclear where this like what type of class this is, and in what format? And I think the second question is, I feel like algorithm algorithms and like computational archiving are 2 different aspects of like computer science applications. 479 01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:20.320 Jenny Duan: Like, I don't think you would like? In what situation would you use an algorithm 480 01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:27.469 Jenny Duan: for preserving cultural heritage like, could you tell me a little bit more about how that works, and maybe we could refine like the name of the class. 481 01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:29.649 huda: Yeah, maybe like. 482 01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:35.502 huda: like, just kind of like the previous essay idea, it was like about like 483 01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.110 huda: like 484 01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:47.559 huda: even ancestry tests. And like kind of the data that you receive, that like you give. And you receive from like those tests. And like. 485 01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:51.099 huda: I guess, like not necessarily with the documents. But like 486 01:06:51.180 --> 01:07:03.990 huda: also just like preserving like cultural data, and ancestral data through like algorithms. But like also like archives, are also stored. I'm I'm sure. Like, like. 487 01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:10.230 Jenny Duan: How do? How do algorithms relate to that like, where do the algorithms come in like algorithms? Do you use? For what purpose. 488 01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.490 huda: It's like to help like 489 01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:24.279 huda: like, sometimes to like visualize, like different, like migration patterns. And sometimes like the data is used to like. 490 01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:28.779 huda: like, I don't know, like help, like the user. See? Like where they're from. 491 01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:29.910 huda: like. 492 01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.129 huda: I guess, like data processes like 493 01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.120 huda: you like genetic information. 494 01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:49.170 Jenny Duan: We changed it to this. 495 01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:00.300 huda: Yeah, this looks good. 496 01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:06.079 Jenny Duan: Like, I think it's I just wanna see, like, where this, how these algorithms are used. 497 01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:15.219 Jenny Duan: I don't know if sorting is the right word. But I think we need another word, because I think someone reading this wouldn't quite understand, like, how algorithms play in. 498 01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:16.950 huda: How she owes it. 499 01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:23.679 huda: I don't know if I like. I like this idea too much. I'm not really sure like what I should make mine about. 500 01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.712 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think we maybe could. I think this could use a rewrite 501 01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.669 Jenny Duan: what else would you teach a class on? 502 01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.770 Jenny Duan: Okay, what? Okay, let's think of the in the short answers. What about you? Haven't you? 503 01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:48.149 Jenny Duan: I think you haven't written about film at all 504 01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.050 Jenny Duan: like I feel like that's kind of a cool. 505 01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:51.970 huda: Yeah. 506 01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:55.379 Jenny Duan: Aspect. And it's like something that you're super involved in. Right? So 507 01:08:55.389 --> 01:08:59.079 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's worth a mention somewhere in this essay. 508 01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.610 huda: This might be really basic. But just like, like. 509 01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.779 huda: how does 510 01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:06.250 huda: like, how does color like. 511 01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.410 huda: yeah, I feel like, that's really basic. There's like a lot of courses that are already taught. 512 01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.759 Jenny Duan: But what's it you could just rant about 513 01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:21.300 Jenny Duan: like in my acting class. A couple weeks ago one of our assignments was, we had to prepare a 5 min round anything. 514 01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:26.370 Jenny Duan: What would you rant about if you had to, if you were to be assigned a rant. 515 01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.319 huda: Hmm! 516 01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.300 huda: I mean, like, realistically, I could talk about like 517 01:09:34.330 --> 01:09:36.929 huda: college for hours, but I think like obviously 518 01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:39.166 huda: fly here. 519 01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:42.129 huda: but 520 01:09:44.019 --> 01:09:45.279 huda: I think like. 521 01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:53.849 huda: oh, I think like something that I was like really want to talk about like, which is also kind of related to film. Is that like, it's kind of the shift 522 01:09:54.019 --> 01:10:16.539 huda: of like like throughout time, like before, like cinematography, used to be really professional and like with the actors and actresses, would always be in like suits and everything. And then I feel like now, like also with just like new technology and like and just like with how accessible, like filmmaking is to everyone. It's become a lot more like 523 01:10:17.529 --> 01:10:26.329 huda: like casual and like also relatable. And so like, now, I think, like filmmaking is like like the access of like 524 01:10:26.459 --> 01:10:35.649 huda: filmmaking resources to almost like anyone, especially with iphones. Now, like, I think that's like really interesting. And I could talk a lot about that. 525 01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:41.940 Jenny Duan: Great idea. Another thing that you could talk about is maybe like I feel like I haven't seen you. 526 01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.959 Jenny Duan: Let me just like, just check this really quickly. 527 01:10:46.095 --> 01:10:51.109 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you haven't really written about your Muslim identity at all in this. 528 01:10:51.490 --> 01:11:05.550 Jenny Duan: Oh, in on all of these Usc essays. And I feel like that's really important, because I feel like you write about being Indian, sure. But like you don't write about being Muslim, and I feel like that's really unique about you. So what if you wrote about like, maybe, like Muslim women in film, or like 529 01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.430 Jenny Duan: something like that? I feel like that's like. 530 01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:21.620 huda: I think, like a big thing is like also in like media and stuff. There's like big representation of like or like big symbolism of like the hijab, and it's definitely used in like many ways. 531 01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.410 Jenny Duan: There you go! 532 01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:24.119 huda: Symbolism of a hedgehog. 533 01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:30.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah, or like the symbolism of a hijab like hijabs in film, like hijabi women in film like 534 01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:36.419 Jenny Duan: hijabi women direct like directors and feel like, you know, something like that I feel like could be really cool. 535 01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:45.610 Jenny Duan: because I definitely think you need to highlight, or you should. Highlight being Muslim in part of your in at least one of your essays, because I don't feel like I've seen it at all so far. 536 01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.610 huda: Yeah. 537 01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:51.520 Jenny Duan: Okay, great. So 538 01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:55.038 Jenny Duan: let's go back and 539 01:11:56.290 --> 01:11:59.050 Jenny Duan: good jobs on camera 540 01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:01.260 Jenny Duan: symbolism of. 541 01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:02.900 huda: Hmm. 542 01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.779 Jenny Duan: Muslim Woman. 543 01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.828 huda: Are you like Muslim women and 544 01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:11.359 Jenny Duan: In film. 545 01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.310 huda: Freedom and media. Maybe. 546 01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:16.089 Jenny Duan: Or Muslim women in modern media, something like that. 547 01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.880 Jenny Duan: It's like your games interactive media. It's like 548 01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:22.190 Jenny Duan: something like that. 549 01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:44.759 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's get a little bit more specific. Would you want to talk about portrayals of Muslim women in modern media? Do you want to talk about 550 01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.350 Jenny Duan: like. 551 01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:49.110 huda: Yeah, like, portrayals, portrayals. 552 01:12:49.639 --> 01:13:08.859 huda: Like, I think, like in specific, like a lot of times in movies, like people always like use like hijabs as like a symbolism of like freedom. And like, it's always like like when they're wearing their hijab, it's like they're not free. And then when they take it off, it's freezing. That's 553 01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:11.700 huda: like a really important aspect. 554 01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:17.509 Jenny Duan: Is this in Western media is this in 555 01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.250 Jenny Duan: games 556 01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.760 Jenny Duan: great? That's good. 557 01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:44.690 huda: Oh, also, I don't really like this one. I think I want to fix it because I just use like I just for now I just put the one from like the San Francisco, but I don't think it matches at all. 558 01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.300 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think we can talk about this the next time we meet. 559 01:13:48.652 --> 01:13:56.390 Jenny Duan: I think I know we're set to meet on Friday. Does that still work for you, or did you want to meet earlier tomorrow? 560 01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:59.340 huda: I think Friday works. 561 01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:07.500 Jenny Duan: Okay and confirming the 7 to 8 work for you. Still, I believe that's the time we set. But I'm not like I don't quite remember. So. 562 01:14:07.765 --> 01:14:09.090 huda: Yeah, that works for me. 563 01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:15.820 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do that. Okay? Then I'll talk to you on Friday and text me if you have anything before then. 564 01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.529 huda: Alright. Yeah, thank you. 565 01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:18.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah. See? Ya, bye?",

How's it going? 2 00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.760 Jenny Duan: Hello! 3 00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.500 Jenny Duan: Hi! Huda! Can you hear me? 4 00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.390 huda: Hi! 5 00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.839 Jenny Duan: There we go. How's it going. 6 00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.059 huda: It's going good. How are you? 7 00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:53.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm pretty good. This week has just been passing by so quickly. I'm going to la this weekend. So I'm like, really excited to be in Socal. But yeah, trying to get ahead on work before I have to leave. 8 00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:06.499 Jenny Duan: yeah, I love your U.S.A, sub. I mean not your U.S.A, your usc supplementals? I've taken a look at them briefly. Can you walk me through like the changes that you've made? 9 00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.520 Jenny Duan: I see that you filled in like these 2 50 word essays. But what else have you changed beyond these. 10 00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:40.690 huda: So for the short answers. The 1st one I kind of came up with a couple like different options, for like which 3 words I can describe myself with. I was actually looking at a couple examples. And there's like some really creative ones like I think someone said like crazy cat lady. And I thought I was like really creative. So I wanted to do something kind of like funny in a way as well. So then I came up with like a couple ideas like Try fuelled gamer 11 00:05:41.033 --> 00:06:00.970 huda: and then try fueled gamer and epistem epistemophilic, which means like the love of knowledge. And then the other ones like kind of the same thing, except with polymath, which kind of just means that, like I do like a whole bunch of things which I guess is pretty relevant because I'm I feel like I. 12 00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.650 Jenny Duan: I think you muted yourself accidentally. 13 00:06:04.650",
    " --> 00:06:05.534 huda: Oh, 14 00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:17.990 huda: yeah, it's kind of interdisciplinary. Like my background. So yeah, that's what I went with like these couple options. But I honestly feel like 15 00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.150 huda: the least wordy one is be. But yeah, I don't know 16 00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:39.450 huda: And then for number 2, I just came up with like another another response. It's another Indian food, Panipuri, and then I just like, added a little comment like strategies, everything. So it's kind of like. 17 00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I like, I like the B better because I feel like it tells you more about, tells them more about how you think. 18 00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.160 huda: Hmm. 19 00:06:46.998 --> 00:07:12.319 huda: and then here I kind of I came up with like another movie which I think is really good. It's animated. It's Ralph breaks the Internet and then I guess I kind of related that to like like code like me coding and like how I also break the Internet with like my code, I guess. But then, yeah, I don't know which wording sounds better. But yeah, I added, like a more funny twist to it, I guess. 20 00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.430 huda: I 21 00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.450 huda: I kind of like the second one. I'm not sure 22 00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.679 huda: And then I also, for for dream job 23 00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:56.920 huda: I had like 2 options as well for that one. I'm also like, really indecisive with this. But yeah, like this one was like the one that we kind of like planned out, which is like, why choose one wordle data. Analyst meets a tech game developer and turning, learn to green squares. Kind of like a wordle reference. And then the second one is like 24 00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:05.430 huda: a little less descriptive, I think, but it's designing games that secretly teach stem topics like hiding veggies in a pizza 25 00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:23.319 huda: and then theme song. I think we already",
    " talked about this, but it's theme from New York, New York, by Frank Sinatra and like one of the quotes, is small town blues are fading or melting away. So then, yeah, I just kind of just that. I think this last sentence is a bit like like this bit is kind of like. I don't know if it's 26 00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.860 huda: like if I should change it. But 27 00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:37.900 huda: And then this one, like, I think I have room for more characters. But I kind of got the point across like I want to visit, like 1957 India 28 00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.749 huda: and then the reasons just like 29 00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:46.970 huda: to get like my grandmother's recipe. And I didn't really add any reasoning, I think, for squid game season 2, but 30 00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:54.530 huda: I probably should. And then same thing with like the roommate and favorite book one and then 31 00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:09.840 huda: for like the class teaching a class, I came up with like 2 ideas, and one of them was about like being like an introvert and like creating change. So the introverts cookbook recipes for success without small talk is the main ingredient. 32 00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:19.900 huda: and the second one is algorithmic nostalgia, 101 preserving cultural heritage through computational archives. 33 00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.850 huda: Oh, I think you're muted. 34 00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:50.999 Jenny Duan: Whoops. Okay, I was. Gonna say, I think, let's start with this 2 50 word essay. And we actually let's start with the short answers, and then we can go to the long answers after that. But I think we can start finalizing some of these short answers today. 35 00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.089 Jenny Duan: or do you want to start with something different. 36 00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.329 huda: No, I think this this that sounds great. 37 00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:03.400 Jenny Duan: Okay, I like this Trifield gamer, Trifield, gamer, epistemophilic. I feel like 38 00:10:03.670 --> 0",
    "0:10:13.699 Jenny Duan: this is fun, because I actually like the long word here. I feel like, because Chi Field is like personality based. Gamer is like also personalities, descriptor. And then I think this is more like. 39 00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.300 Jenny Duan: so how you think. And I, and I like the long word here. I feel like it's good. 40 00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:27.240 Jenny Duan: This. So I think this one. I feel good about this answer, finalized this one. I feel good about this finalized now I think 41 00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.350 Jenny Duan: here. 42 00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.388 Jenny Duan: I like Ralph breaks the Internet. 43 00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.680 Jenny Duan: but I don't. I don't think this sounds smooth. 44 00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.340 huda: Yeah. 45 00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.210 Jenny Duan: Maybe like 46 00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.269 Jenny Duan: like, I'm not sure if the reader would understand 47 00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.699 Jenny Duan: like, why do you break your code every day? Isn't that the point to like. 48 00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:59.549 Jenny Duan: not break your code. Or I I mean, I get that. The point is to break your code. But like or to keep coding, which breaks your code. But like, can you elaborate? Why, breaking your code is important. 49 00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.859 Jenny Duan: We're white. Is that every day. 50 00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:09.169 huda: Like when you're like implementing new features. There's like things that you don't know. And it's like trying by experimentation. I guess. 51 00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.079 Jenny Duan: Okay, can you emphasize that here? How many words do you have for each of these. 52 00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.079 huda: It's a hundred characters. 53 00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.890 Jenny Duan: When for each of these. 54 00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.540 huda: Yeah. 55 00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.660 Jenny Duan: Okay. 56 00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.013 huda: So this is already kind of like, it's 93 characters. So",
    ". 57 00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:45.310 Jenny Duan: Because this seems like, like, I don't see the intention behind. Why, you break your code here, and I feel like that's important in the context of this mistake. 58 00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.149 huda: Should I say, like experiment with my code. 59 00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.380 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 60 00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.210 huda: This is 116 characters. 61 00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:54.909 huda: Maybe I don't need the bugs, for I could just say, like experiment, experiment with my code. But hey? I fix them eventually. 62 00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.400 Jenny Duan: How does that connect? How does that connect to the movie. 63 00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:13.189 Jenny Duan: I feel like the connection here is that, like Ralph is breaking the Internet, and you are breaking code. And I feel like that is an important analogy, but I'm just trying to figure out how I can make that fit a little bit better. 64 00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.500 Jenny Duan: see. 65 00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:56.170 huda: Maybe like instead, like Ralph breaks the Internet and instead of emphasizing, like how I create bugs, I can focus on like how I debug, debug, my code. 66 00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 67 00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.484 huda: So. 68 00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.060 Jenny Duan: Like, okay, let me look up this movie because I wonder if there's 69 00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.289 Jenny Duan: like a specific visual imagery we can create. Yeah. 70 00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.769 Jenny Duan: this is great. 71 00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.500 Jenny Duan: I love that. I think that this is good. 72 00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:48.740 Jenny Duan: Guess I'm not the only one constantly debugging. Okay, I feel like this tone. This tone is much better than the last one, much more focused on, like 73 00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.240 Jenny Duan: I don't know on 74 00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.100 Jenny Duan: the bugs rather than like your process of debugging ",
    "them, which is what we wanted to have. 75 00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.380 Jenny Duan: Okay 76 00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.670 Jenny Duan: in debugging great 77 00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.040 Jenny Duan: dream job. 78 00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:28.080 Jenny Duan: Okay? I think for this one I want to avoid like this specific game, because by the time you're working. You don't know if Wordle is still going to be as popular. You might love Wordle, but it might not be like the It game. There might be something new and and better. And you you want your job to be something that like has longevity in the future, not just something that's like trending right now. 79 00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.850 huda: Yeah. 80 00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:47.549 Jenny Duan: So. And I also want to avoid mentioning, like a specific game or specific something that's not like an established cultural icon, because I feel like Wordle is still too new. It's new enough to still be considered like a fad. And so you don't want to place your dream job over something that's like, maybe temporary for other people. 81 00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:50.770 Jenny Duan: So 82 00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.819 Jenny Duan: is there another way you could write this 83 00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.360 Jenny Duan: like something meets a tech game developer turning learn into something. 84 00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.739 Jenny Duan: Or I guess the turning learn is a word all specific rest, reference. But. 85 00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.689 huda: Yeah, I think maybe like. 86 00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.129 huda: I could just do like data journalist. Maybe. 87 00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.670 Jenny Duan: Okay. 88 00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.379 Jenny Duan: maybe you can say something like translating. 89 00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.080 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 90 00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.079 Jenny Duan: translating. 91 00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.030 huda: Like 92 00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.540 huda: statistics to 93 00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.130 huda: or actually, I ",
    "don't know. 94 00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.160 huda: like. 95 00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.260 Jenny Duan: Data point. 96 00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.619 Jenny Duan: translating 97 00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.110 Jenny Duan: data points into 98 00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.520 Jenny Duan: interactive stories 99 00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.730 Jenny Duan: translating 100 00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:18.740 Jenny Duan: from 101 00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.090 Jenny Duan: okay. 102 00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.730 huda: Hmm. 103 00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.629 huda: maybe like telling stories and 104 00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.590 huda: translating statistics simultaneously. 105 00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.669 Jenny Duan: Say that one more time. 106 00:18:35.832 --> 00:18:40.410 huda: Maybe like translating statistics and telling stories simultaneously. 107 00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.979 Jenny Duan: think that works 108 00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.670 Jenny Duan: or 109 00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:56.839 Jenny Duan: I want to see. I want to see, like the connection between data journalism and game developing. 110 00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:09.860 Jenny Duan: And I feel like doing them at the same time is, isn't the same thing as like being a data journalist meets because I think the key word here is like meets a tech game developers. So how are you? Somehow, both same time. 111 00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.769 huda: And I think this kind of sums it. But like 112 00:19:14.188 --> 00:19:17.779 huda: I guess, like, in a way, also like teaching 113 00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.369 huda: teaching like stem related topics through interactive stories. 114 00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like this is oops. I feel like this reads fine to me. Let me look at the 115 00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.240 Jenny Duan: word count on here. 116 00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, a hundred 11. 117 00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.649 huda: Oh, okay, it says 110. So. 118 00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.650 Jenny Duan: I",
    " included the period at the end. 119 00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.759 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, with the space with them.

Yeah. 126 00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.489 Jenny Duan: Let's do that. 127 00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.865 Jenny Duan: Okay. 128 00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.920 Jenny Duan: see here. 129 00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.570 Jenny Duan: if you had a theme song, what would it be? 130 00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.749 Jenny Duan: I think this is good, except we're let's just 131 00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.190 Jenny Duan: fix this like I'm bringing big change. 132 00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.750 huda: Hmm, bye. 133 00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.170 Jenny Duan: Everything else is fine 134 00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.319 Jenny Duan: is I'm bringing big change. A line from the song. 135 00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:41.080 huda: I don't think so. Wait. 136 00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:51.910 huda: No. 137 00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.470 huda: maybe like 138 00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.650 huda: like 139 00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.099 huda: the stench of a farm can't stop me, or something. 140 00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.029 Jenny Duan: I don't know if I would say that, but 141 00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.179 Jenny Duan: I would say 142 00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.480 Jenny Duan: I'm good 143 00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.870 Jenny Duan: something like that. 144 00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.090 huda: Hmm! I think the multi one was part of like the lyrics. That's why I kept it. But. 145 00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.060 Jenny Duan: Oh. 146 00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.460 Jenny Duan: maybe I would do it like this then, just to denote that they're familiar. 147 00:23:16.900 --",
    "> 00:23:18.769 huda: And I'll also put this to them. 148 00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.799 huda: Yeah, that fits. Then 149 00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.080 huda: great. 150 00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.070 Jenny Duan: Hello! 151 00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.979 Jenny Duan: I think maybe we could change this dream trip, because. 152 00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:41.282 Jenny Duan: in my opinion, 153 00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.469 Jenny Duan: in my opinion, this 154 00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.440 Jenny Duan: one 155 00:23:51.700 --> 00:24:00.509 Jenny Duan: feels like it's I think you talk a lot about culture like, for example, in this Chai field here in Panipuri. And I don't know if you need to 156 00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.450 Jenny Duan: reference that again. I mean, I think it's like 157 00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:11.250 Jenny Duan: I think it's valuable, but I don't know if it adds anything new to about you. 158 00:24:13.335 --> 00:24:15.700 Jenny Duan: But open to hear your thoughts on this. 159 00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:23.489 huda: Yeah, I agree. I think I mentioned a couple of times I mean, like another like way I was like thinking of approaching it, which is 160 00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:45.280 huda: kind of related to culture. But it's also like another thing like I was thinking of like saying, like 1957, India, where I can tell like the stories my grandparents never got to, or something like that like. So it's kind of related to like my storytelling aspect. But so kind of the same, but I think like. 161 00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.799 huda: but we should do something else like that's also fine. 162 00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.709 Jenny Duan: What's the something else that you? 163 00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.160 Jenny Duan: I guess like. What if you could just 164 00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.190 Jenny Duan: think about where else you would travel? Where else would you go? 165 00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.520 huda: And 166 00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.170 huda: maybe like 167 00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:20.",
    "859 huda: like I mean, this is just kind of like not really related to me. But I want to go to turkey to see like the architecture there. But 168 00:25:22.024 --> 00:25:25.319 huda: I guess that doesn't really say much about me in the essay. 169 00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:32.029 Jenny Duan: What? What? Why do you want to see the architecture? I feel like that could be the. 170 00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:38.392 huda: I mean, like, there's like history, like a lot of history behind each of them. And then, like 171 00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.049 huda: I mean, it's just like really pretty. But 172 00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.110 huda: I could also like 173 00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:52.430 huda: travel back to when like the 1st video game was created. But 174 00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.060 huda: I don't know if that's like 175 00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.210 huda: relevant to the prompt. 176 00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.960 Jenny Duan: I mean anything that you can use like 177 00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.609 Jenny Duan: turkey. If you talked about that, it would highlight like your sense of adventure and curiosity, for the world which I feel like 178 00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.990 Jenny Duan: is important, too, in and of itself. 179 00:26:15.862 --> 00:26:19.399 Jenny Duan: But I feel like for your dream trip. 180 00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.190 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 181 00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.730 Jenny Duan: What else is important to you that you feel like you haven't shown on your application yet. 182 00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.590 huda: I don't think 183 00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.240 huda: I've 184 00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.650 huda: I feel like I'd 185 00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.160 huda: kind of briefly mentioned, like 186 00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.500 huda: like journalism and filmmaking. 187 00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.140 huda: hmm. 188 00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.940 huda: And also. 189 00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:09.679 huda: yeah, I don't think I mentioned like like journalism at all. Besides, lik",
    "e data journalism. 190 00:27:15.894 --> 00:27:22.480 Jenny Duan: Okay. So maybe where's 1 place where you would go to tell the stories of people? Is it India, or is it anywhere else? 191 00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.260 huda: I mean, there's like a lot of places 192 00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.043 huda: and like 193 00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.109 huda: I don't really know how to answer this. 194 00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.699 huda: I mean, I think, yeah, like in India. 195 00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.770 huda: seeing like 196 00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.960 huda: oh, like almost, I feel like I'm going back into the culture part. But like 197 00:27:53.410 --> 00:28:01.100 huda: like almost every family, has, like a partition story, and so like. I think it would be really interesting to report like all of those. 198 00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.280 huda: But 199 00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.340 huda: no, no. 200 00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.879 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! Can you try to distill that into a response. 201 00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.269 huda: Yeah. But also like, I don't know if that also again, like 202 00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.259 huda: delves back into like the cultural aspect. 203 00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.269 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think it's fine to write about culture, if, if like, that's what you're most interested in, because 204 00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:26.990 Jenny Duan: you do want it to be genuine to you, and so like, are there any other stories that you would want to tell? Besides that that you feel like are meaningful to you? 205 00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:48.849 huda: I mean, like kind of circling back to like tech obsession, I think like. 206 00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.560 huda: oh, maybe telling like the story of like 207 00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.700 huda: like Ada Lovelace, which I know she's like like heavily covered now. 208 00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.660 huda: but like a lot of people don't know like how like her personal life was. 209 00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.090 ",
    "huda: and also like 210 00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.989 huda: like how much of a contribution she made to like tech 211 00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.670 huda: and I think that's like one of those stories. But then I feel like again, that might be a little basic. 212 00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.400 huda: So. 213 00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:49.990 Jenny Duan: Okay, what is what is a place that you genuinely want to travel to? I feel like for this question. Maybe they're just asking also for a straightforward answer, because they want to know, like what you're interested in. For example, like some people are interested in archaeology, and so they might want to go to ancient Greece. Some people are interested in like music, so they might want to go to Vienna like it might just be a place that you're interested in, because you like the architecture, and that's like super valid. Or if there's like a specific city that you would want to go to for, and just like a personal interest and curiosity. 214 00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:58.920 huda: Yeah. Then, in that case it would probably be like Turkey. Like Istanbul, or like 215 00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:04.920 huda: even Florence, Italy like that. It's like a really beautiful place. 216 00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:09.860 huda: yeah. 217 00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:20.010 Jenny Duan: Something that's interesting about Turkey that you could write about is Turkey is kind of like the intersection between, like the Eastern and Western worlds, and I feel like that creates for an interesting like cultural fusion. 218 00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.080 Jenny Duan: Oh. 219 00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.450 Jenny Duan: so maybe like that could be something you write about. 220 00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.899 huda: Actually like I don't know how to.

    "d of the like the lamp, it's like they're all like vastly different, like, they look really different. So like they probably have like different 248 00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.499 huda: stories. I guess if I'm looking too deep into it. But 249 00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:29.060 huda: yeah, I don't. Don't think that really matches with like the East and West. Theme. 250 00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:08.980 Jenny Duan: Maybe something like that. 251 00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.040 huda: Oh, yeah.

And also like it's, it requires so much critical thinking, because you're literally playing games with 266 00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.940 Jenny Duan: yourself. I guess. 267 00:37:19.790 --> 00:3",
    "7:20.510 Jenny Duan: Oh! 268 00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:26.029 huda: So I don't know which aspects I should focus on like if I wanted to do something quirky. It could be like like 269 00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:32.039 huda: I've been on the edge of my seat for the past 2 years from that last cliffhanger actually, like. 270 00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.630 Jenny Duan: Doesn't add any information about you. 271 00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:35.830 huda: Hmm! 272 00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.540 huda: And 273 00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.720 huda: maybe like. 274 00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:14.549 huda: maybe, like, I can say like what I would do if I was like in a life or death situation like squid games, which I mean like. I don't think it would be necessarily true, but I could just say something like how I like de-stress, which is like through journaling, which I don't think I don't think it's like 275 00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.339 huda: really accurate for the situation. But 276 00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.520 huda: that might be like one way I can incorporate like how it's related to me I don't know. 277 00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.140 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 278 00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.640 Jenny Duan: let's see. 279 00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:55.240 Jenny Duan: maybe you could write about something something interesting about, like the intricacies of the game, or like like creative problem solving. 280 00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.710 huda: Hmm 281 00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.080 huda: maybe 282 00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:11.770 huda: hmm. 283 00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 284 00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.310 Jenny Duan: no. 285 00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:03.510 Jenny Duan: What? What's 1 detail about sweet game season, one that like stands out to you, or that you remember quite clearly. 286 00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.229 huda: I remember like 287 00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.809 huda: like kind of how 288 00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:14.279 huda: I guess it like 289 00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.599 huda: in squid ",
    "game. One like 290 00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:34.540 huda: a lot of themes were like tied into it, like, for example, like even like misogyny, was like tied into it somehow, like with like the behavior towards like the female. People in the squid games. And then there's like a lot of aspects like that like 291 00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.309 huda: which are really telling. But I think 292 00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.319 huda: like one thing that really stood out was 293 00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.450 huda: on 294 00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:58.269 huda: like this one scene where, like there's like a bunch I mean, like, I don't know if this is too like graphic, but like there's like one scene where there's like a bunch of people getting eliminated. But there was like happy music playing, which was like. 295 00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:05.290 huda: I don't know, just like the filmmaking was really really well done, because it's like really unexpected. 296 00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.633 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 297 00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.969 Jenny Duan: we could do like. 298 00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.309 Jenny Duan: how does squid game season 2 like. 299 00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:33.269 Jenny Duan: reflect something about you? Or what? What? If anything, does it show 300 00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.510 Jenny Duan: for your lives. 301 00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:52.789 huda: I mean, I think in the second season, like the guy who wins he actually goes back to the squid games, I think like that was like how like ended up, but like. 302 00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:53.380 Jenny Duan: No. 303 00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:00.840 huda: I guess like, and I don't know if I'm reading too much into it. But it's almost kind of like he's continuing back 304 00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.010 huda: like 305 00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:11.970 huda: this might be a reach, but like how like? After I was done learning like like cs and stuff. I kind of went back to try and help 306 00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:20.359 huda: others teach. So lik",
    "e, I don't know, like, I don't know how to make that connection. But yeah, I guess like Season 2 shows like he's going back. 307 00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.040 huda: I don't know if he's going back to like support others, but 308 00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.500 huda: hmm! 309 00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:50.640 Jenny Duan: I feel like what's most powerful about squid game that you can connect to your life is how it's solving games. And it's thinking about real life in like a series of puzzles. Maybe you can say some like, I feel like, that's what's valuable about switch games, is it? Shows these very human emotions in like a gamified or puzzling way. And that relates to your own story of like thinking and solving problems like it's kind of just like 310 00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.070 Jenny Duan: Wordle, or it's like you're thinking about puzzles in a very 311 00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:05.709 Jenny Duan: relevant way to your own life. And so is there a way that you can apply these themes from squid game into the way that you view or think about the world in some way, or the way that you think about problem solving. 312 00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:20.900 huda: Maybe, like like in in squid game, like squid games like reveals like human nature. And in that way, like there's like games can reveal, like like new things, like how like a person learns 313 00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.020 huda: or like what their values are. And 314 00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:27.800 huda: that's it. 315 00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.979 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's really good. 316 00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.490 Jenny Duan: How's that 317 00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.450 Jenny Duan: you can? You have some opportunity to add to this if you want? This is just 80 characters. 318 00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.620 huda: Yeah, looks good. I think 319 00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.880 huda: I'll try and see if I could like 320 00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.419 huda: somehow. Make it a little funnier. 321 00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.100 Jenny Duan: ",
    "Yeah. 322 00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:52.430 Jenny Duan: if you can add like a little like something here, like 2 words, or one through 2 to 3 words, which is something funny. 323 00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:53.380 huda: Hmm. 324 00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:09.369 Jenny Duan: Like what like something like that's the opposite of like count me in. But like, you know, like something short and sweet like that. 325 00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:19.850 huda: Maybe I could do something like like PE class, because it's like you're also doing like puzzle slash games. And it reveals a lot about human behavior. 326 00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.100 huda: Hmm. 327 00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.370 Jenny Duan: Okay, how's that. 328 00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:33.860 huda: Yeah, it looks good. 329 00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:35.220 huda: That's good. 330 00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.510 Jenny Duan: Oh, avatar!

Can you remind me what under the tamarind tree is about again. 425 00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:41.910 huda: There's like different, like flashbacks. Okay? So basically, there's like a family in Pakistan. And they have like, there's like 4 people. And they recall like their past. And there's like a lot of flashbacks into different nights of like, I believe it was partition era. Let me just double check. 426 00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.439 huda: yeah, it's about like 427 00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.170 huda: 4 friends. 428 00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:02.209 huda: Who's it says you're like the dark their dark secrets lead to a life-changing night. 429 00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:04.579 huda: During like the partition era 430 00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.810 huda: And then it's like, it's really like. 431 00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:15.464 huda: I don't know how to describe. It's like a really like sad. It's like 432 00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.485 huda: a really sad story. But it's also like really interesting 433 00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:24.680 huda: to like hear about the history of like Pakistan during the partition. I think. 434 00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:37.350 Jenny Duan: Okay. And how does this connect to you? Or why is this important to you? 435 00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:43.490 huda: I think I'm well in general, I'm like really interested in like 436 00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:47.860 huda: stories of like South Asia during the partition. 437 00:58:48.235 --> 00:58:48.610 Jenny Duan: Oh! 438 00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:56.480 huda: Under colonization.

I feel like that's really important. And it's a key aspect of your application. Because, like through journalism, through data, through stories in general, you, you hope to like make a change in other people. And I feel like this is a good example of how that's changing you as a person. 444 00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:40.760 Jenny Duan: What do you think? Is there a way that you could condense all of that down to 445 00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.250 Jenny Duan: a hundred characters only. 446 00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:48.629 huda: Also, I don't think we need to put the offer. I think I. 447 00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:50.469 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I don't think so either. 448 01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.020 huda: maybe like 449 01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:12.110 huda: sparked my empathy in. 450 01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.830 huda: Oh, like wait!

    "459 01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:03.399 huda: Okay, I'm just gonna write something. But 460 01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.820 huda: and. 461 01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:17.630 Jenny Duan: It's okay. You can write all your thoughts down. We can condense it. It's it's okay. It doesn't have to be perfect with it. With the 1st draft. 462 01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:49.620 huda: Yeah, I don't. I don't like the wording of this at all. But 463 01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.470 huda: hmm. 464 01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:57.160 Jenny Duan: That's a hundred characters. But I don't know about all of this. 465 01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.079 Jenny Duan: I don't know about this last line. If it's necessary. 466 01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:03.880 huda: Hmm, 467 01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:16.540 huda: I I think it's important, because, like, like you said, it's like a big part of like my extracurriculars and my profile as well. 468 01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:19.910 huda: yeah, I'll see if I could like. 469 01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:23.910 huda: like, maybe 470 01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.369 huda: yeah, like word it 471 01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.430 huda: in different way, maybe. 472 01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.279 huda: But yeah, for now I think this is a good. 473 01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.019 Jenny Duan: I think. Yeah, for now it's good you can. We can revisit it if we need to. 474 01:05:36.855 --> 01:05:40.829 Jenny Duan: I wanna come back to this, if you could teach a class on any topic 475 01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.679 Jenny Duan: would be 476 01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:49.989 Jenny Duan: okay. I don't think either of these quite make sense. 477 01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:53.759 Jenny Duan: I think, because number one, it's not exactly clear like 478 01:05:53.980 --> 01:06:16.280 Jenny Duan: what department your class would be in like, is it a? It's not a cooking class. It's not like a public speaking class. It would be kind of unclear where this like what type of class this is, and in what format? And I think the second question is",
    ", I feel like algorithm algorithms and like computational archiving are 2 different aspects of like computer science applications. 479 01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:20.320 Jenny Duan: Like, I don't think you would like? In what situation would you use an algorithm 480 01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:27.469 Jenny Duan: for preserving cultural heritage like, could you tell me a little bit more about how that works, and maybe we could refine like the name of the class. 481 01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:29.649 huda: Yeah, maybe like. 482 01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:35.502 huda: like, just kind of like the previous essay idea, it was like about like 483 01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.110 huda: like 484 01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:47.559 huda: even ancestry tests. And like kind of the data that you receive, that like you give. And you receive from like those tests. And like. 485 01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:51.099 huda: I guess, like not necessarily with the documents. But like 486 01:06:51.180 --> 01:07:03.990 huda: also just like preserving like cultural data, and ancestral data through like algorithms. But like also like archives, are also stored. I'm I'm sure. Like, like. 487 01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:10.230 Jenny Duan: How do? How do algorithms relate to that like, where do the algorithms come in like algorithms? Do you use? For what purpose. 488 01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.490 huda: It's like to help like 489 01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:24.279 huda: like, sometimes to like visualize, like different, like migration patterns. And sometimes like the data is used to like. 490 01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:28.779 huda: like, I don't know, like help, like the user. See? Like where they're from. 491 01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:29.910 huda: like. 492 01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.129 huda: I guess, like data processes like 493 01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.120 huda: you like genetic information. 494 01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:49.170 Jenny Duan: We changed it to this. 495 01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:00.300 huda: Yeah, this looks good. 496 01:08:02.050 --> ",
    "01:08:06.079 Jenny Duan: Like, I think it's I just wanna see, like, where this, how these algorithms are used. 497 01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:15.219 Jenny Duan: I don't know if sorting is the right word. But I think we need another word, because I think someone reading this wouldn't quite understand, like, how algorithms play in. 498 01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:16.950 huda: How she owes it. 499 01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:23.679 huda: I don't know if I like. I like this idea too much. I'm not really sure like what I should make mine about. 500 01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.712 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think we maybe could. I think this could use a rewrite 501 01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.669 Jenny Duan: what else would you teach a class on? 502 01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.770 Jenny Duan: Okay, what? Okay, let's think of the in the short answers. What about you? Haven't you? 503 01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:48.149 Jenny Duan: I think you haven't written about film at all 504 01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.050 Jenny Duan: like I feel like that's kind of a cool. 505 01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:51.970 huda: Yeah. 506 01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:55.379 Jenny Duan: Aspect. And it's like something that you're super involved in. Right? So 507 01:08:55.389 --> 01:08:59.079 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's worth a mention somewhere in this essay. 508 01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.610 huda: This might be really basic. But just like, like. 509 01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.779 huda: how does 510 01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:06.250 huda: like, how does color like. 511 01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.410 huda: yeah, I feel like, that's really basic. There's like a lot of courses that are already taught. 512 01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.759 Jenny Duan: But what's it you could just rant about 513 01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:21.300 Jenny Duan: like in my acting class. A couple weeks ago one of our assignments was, we had to prepare a 5 min round anything. 514 01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:26.370 Jenny Duan: What would you rant about if you had to, if you were to be ass",
    "igned a rant. 515 01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.319 huda: Hmm! 516 01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.300 huda: I mean, like, realistically, I could talk about like 517 01:09:34.330 --> 01:09:36.929 huda: college for hours, but I think like obviously 518 01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:39.166 huda: fly here. 519 01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:42.129 huda: but 520 01:09:44.019 --> 01:09:45.279 huda: I think like. 521 01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:53.849 huda: oh, I think like something that I was like really want to talk about like, which is also kind of related to film. Is that like, it's kind of the shift 522 01:09:54.019 --> 01:10:16.539 huda: of like like throughout time, like before, like cinematography, used to be really professional and like with the actors and actresses, would always be in like suits and everything. And then I feel like now, like also with just like new technology and like and just like with how accessible, like filmmaking is to everyone. It's become a lot more like 523 01:10:17.529 --> 01:10:26.329 huda: like casual and like also relatable. And so like, now, I think, like filmmaking is like like the access of like 524 01:10:26.459 --> 01:10:35.649 huda: filmmaking resources to almost like anyone, especially with iphones. Now, like, I think that's like really interesting. And I could talk a lot about that. 525 01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:41.940 Jenny Duan: Great idea. Another thing that you could talk about is maybe like I feel like I haven't seen you. 526 01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.959 Jenny Duan: Let me just like, just check this really quickly. 527 01:10:46.095 --> 01:10:51.109 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you haven't really written about your Muslim identity at all in this. 528 01:10:51.490 --> 01:11:05.550 Jenny Duan: Oh, in on all of these Usc essays. And I feel like that's really important, because I feel like you write about being Indian, sure. But like you don't write about being Muslim, and I feel like that's really unique about you. So what if you wrote about like, maybe, like Muslim ",
    "women in film, or like 529 01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.430 Jenny Duan: something like that? I feel like that's like. 530 01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:21.620 huda: I think, like a big thing is like also in like media and stuff. There's like big representation of like or like big symbolism of like the hijab, and it's definitely used in like many ways. 531 01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.410 Jenny Duan: There you go! 532 01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:24.119 huda: Symbolism of a hedgehog. 533 01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:30.440 Jenny Duan: Yeah, or like the symbolism of a hijab like hijabs in film, like hijabi women in film like 534 01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:36.419 Jenny Duan: hijabi women direct like directors and feel like, you know, something like that I feel like could be really cool. 535 01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:45.610 Jenny Duan: because I definitely think you need to highlight, or you should.
