One of Coda's classy. 5 00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:20.059 hudasiraj: I enjoyed it a lot, especially yesterday. We got to learn SQL, so that's like, I like learning new things so like the past ones like we learn like python, and like some like kind of repetitive stuff, so like kind of uninterested. But when we learned SQL. Is like really interesting, because I didn't know anything about it. But yeah. 6 00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.199 Jenny Duan: What's your project? What are you working on. 7 00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:28.270 hudasiraj: We're making like, a data kind of like. 8 00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:47.889 hudasiraj: So like researching how computer access has to do with like, count the amount of money like someone makes and also like. And as a way, and like our target audience is like investors and like governments, so that they'd like, invest in kind of computer access for their countries. But yeah. 9 00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.089 Jenny Duan: And how's the progress been on that so far? 10 00:05:52.812 --> 00:05:58.259 hudasiraj: Right now, we're just kind of writing like the problem statements and everything. But yeah, we're not 11 00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.050 hudasiraj: Yeah, we're not like, we haven't actually started like the data science part yet. 12 00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.460 Jenny Duan: Got it. And how do you like your group so far. 13 00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:22.869 hudasiraj: I like it. I think everyone's really like motivated, and we all like shows like the interest of like education and unlike, I guess, financial inequity. So I think that's like we're easily we're like able to like easily come up with one idea. 14 00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:36.182 Jenny Duan: Cool. I'm super glad that's going. Well. And yeah, I think that 1st of all, I want to just ask if there's anything specific that you want to discuss today. But if not, 15 00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.310 Jenny Duan: we can go into your activities and awards again. 16 00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:51.079 hudasiraj: Yeah, I don't really have anything specific. I I did start working on my portfolio like again. It's like, not completely done. It's just 17 00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.920 hudasiraj: thumb. 18 00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.470 hudasiraj: I put the link 19 00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.780 hudasiraj: and it's not completely done like I've just started working on it. But I think I made the progress. 20 00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.550 Jenny Duan: Awesome and can I see the progress you have, like an update on the website. 21 00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.689 hudasiraj: Yeah. I sent the link in the chat. But I can share my screen if you want. 22 00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.660 Jenny Duan: No, I can look at the chat. I didn't get the notification 23 00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.830 Jenny Duan: cool. 24 00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.890 Jenny Duan: Oh, I love the new the new color scheme. 25 00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:30.120 hudasiraj: Thank you. Yeah. I saw those the one like the references that you sent, and I thought like it'd be nicer to do something more playful. 26 00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:36.059 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh, I like how that the the things spin when you like scroll up! How does that work? Or how? Yeah. 27 00:07:36.704 --> 00:07:42.880 hudasiraj: I use web portal to make it to be honest. But yeah, like, there's like animations on there. Yeah. 28 00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.509 Jenny Duan: Looks really nice. 29 00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.766 hudasiraj: Thank you. 30 00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.989 hudasiraj: I made a page for empowering AI, and like I I'm not done but with 31 00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.750 hudasiraj: Oh, I think I linked this wrong page for Cynthoria. 32 00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.010 Jenny Duan: What is? Yeah, what is Synthoria's Fijian? 22. 33 00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.530 Jenny Duan: It looks different. 34 00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.569 hudasiraj: Yeah, I this is the old page that I had. I think 35 00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.999 hudasiraj: I think I named it wrong. Wait, let me. 36 00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.720 hudasiraj: Can you refresh the page. Wait, Ashley. 37 00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.940 hudasiraj: it's publishing 38 00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.390 hudasiraj: now. Yeah. 39 00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.819 hudasiraj: that should be the right one. 40 00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.429 Jenny Duan: Let me see. 41 00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.860 hudasiraj: Oh, no! That that's the wrong one. 42 00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.649 Jenny Duan: It still links to the same page that it linked before. 43 00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.529 hudasiraj: Wait. That's so strange. Okay. 44 00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.450 hudasiraj: okay, wait. Let me retry. 45 00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.870 hudasiraj: Okay, can you try refreshing now? 46 00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.480 hudasiraj: Why does it keep going. 47 00:08:56.714 --> 00:09:00.470 Jenny Duan: It still doesn't. Maybe it takes like a while to load. Do you think that's it? 48 00:09:02.123 --> 00:09:06.380 hudasiraj: I don't know. I'm I'm like linking the right thing. I'm not sure what's happening. 49 00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.139 Jenny Duan: I like the interactive, how you can kind of drag and like, move the photo when you like, drag your mouse. 50 00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.516 hudasiraj: Thank you. 51 00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.960 hudasiraj: Yeah, I don't know. That's not supposed to be there. I don't know why that's there, but. 52 00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.974 hudasiraj: Yeah, I I think I'll I'll figure it out. 53 00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.075 Jenny Duan: Okay? Then I think that 54 00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:45.859 Jenny Duan: maybe what we can talk about is with your extracurriculars. Remember how we talked about you are missing like one to 2 extracurriculars, and one to 2 awards. 55 00:09:46.251 --> 00:10:01.709 Jenny Duan: I think, for the award on the awards. I think that that will naturally get filled in with the national merit and also the Presidential Volunteer Service award. So I think that those will actually be taken care of because you said your score meets the cut off for national merit right. 56 00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:27.159 hudasiraj: Yeah. And also I wanted to say, like, if I'm not able to get the present cause, I don't know if we get like the Presidential scholar status before applying so if not like. This is also kind of maybe. But we could. I could possibly get the Ap Scholar with distinction award this year. If I do get some like above 3 on my ap exams. 57 00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:48.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like that is not as impressive of an award, though, as presidential volunteer service award. Just because I feel like a lot of people get that. So I think the more niche your award is where the more specific, the better. So have you heard anything from the camera impact foundation about moving to the next round yet, or I I don't even know if their 1st round's over. So. 58 00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.969 hudasiraj: No, I haven't heard anything from them. 59 00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:58.979 Jenny Duan: I think that that might be in November then, because I think that there's still cause you applied like early, but I don't know if their regular application deadline is still 60 00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.250 Jenny Duan: taking applicants. So 61 00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.699 Jenny Duan: let's see, what else would you have for your early? 62 00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.810 Jenny Duan: So why don't you think that you'll be able to secure Presidential volunteer service award? Or what is the barrier there. 63 00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:19.709 hudasiraj: It's because, like, I know, it's like I think, for seniors and I think I don't know if they'll be able to like like 64 00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:27.439 hudasiraj: have me like name that before, like I graduate. I think that's the kind of thing that they give at graduation. I'm not sure, though. 65 00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.339 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. You see. 66 00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.729 hudasiraj: A little bit into it, so I was like, hold on! Let me go to the my school site. 67 00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.020 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 68 00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.859 hudasiraj: There's like senior awards. Let me share my screen. 69 00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.689 hudasiraj: There's Senior awards. There's I got this pathway recognition. 70 00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:00.750 hudasiraj: Huh? 71 00:12:03.977 --> 00:12:13.670 hudasiraj: Yeah. And then I think these are the community service hours awards. And I I don't know. It doesn't say anything about presidential scholar 72 00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.260 hudasiraj: And then I think you need like 73 00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.289 hudasiraj: 300 to get the 74 00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:35.110 hudasiraj: community Service Senior Award. And then, just for, like the block letter, and like the certificates, 200, but I don't know if 75 00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.790 hudasiraj: that like really means anything but 76 00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:51.020 hudasiraj: cause. I remember like people like on their Linkedin, like people from my school. I saw, like presidential scholar award, but like I'm not sure how they got those already. Oh. 77 00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.249 Jenny Duan: Do they have to do it through an external organization? Maybe. 78 00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.613 hudasiraj: Yeah. And then I went, and then I went to 79 00:13:01.056 --> 00:13:02.480 hudasiraj: Hold on, I'm gonna. 80 00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.959 Jenny Duan: Cause. I think you need to do it through a certifying organization. 81 00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.380 hudasiraj: Yeah, I think. But when I want on here, I think, like 82 00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:22.380 hudasiraj: someone else has to like, give it to you. And then and then I think you have to like, there's only like 2 options like, either you like, apply to be like an organization that can give it. Or you can like 83 00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.028 hudasiraj: actually be like the student receiving it. And 84 00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.470 Jenny Duan: Oh, this is something different. This is Presidential scholars. Presidential volunteer service award is different. 85 00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.529 hudasiraj: Sorry. I'm actually 86 00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.550 hudasiraj: okay. Yeah, this is this is what I was talking about. Then, like. 87 00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.063 hudasiraj: yeah, like, 88 00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.460 hudasiraj: like, if you apply 89 00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.390 hudasiraj: you applied through. 90 00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.269 hudasiraj: you apply as 91 00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.970 hudasiraj: I'll collect. 92 00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.360 hudasiraj: Yeah, like this is not 93 00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.910 hudasiraj: for, like the students, I think. 94 00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.750 Jenny Duan: This is for the yeah. So you need to have an organization to certify you. 95 00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.101 Jenny Duan: Does your school? So you said that your school does your school certify, or. 96 00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.811 hudasiraj: That's what I was thinking. But I'm but I'm not sure anymore, because, like, I don't. 97 00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.650 Jenny Duan: How's the people around you like, get them? 98 00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.159 Jenny Duan: Do you want to look at their maybe their Linkedin right now and see like 99 00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.400 Jenny Duan: what organization certified them. 100 00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.760 hudasiraj: I actually don't remember who 101 00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.159 hudasiraj: exactly plus phone 102 00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.279 Jenny Duan: You can. Yeah, search. 103 00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.120 Jenny Duan: whoop. 104 00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.630 hudasiraj: I don't think this person goes to my school, but maybe their school gave it. 105 00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.790 Jenny Duan: Maybe you make a wish America would give it. 106 00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.870 Jenny Duan: Usually I feel like it's not the school that gives it. 107 00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.759 Jenny Duan: I think it's usually 108 00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.000 Jenny Duan: organization. 109 00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.120 hudasiraj: Yeah, I don't know. He doesn't give information on who gave it, but. 110 00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, so you need a certifying organization to give it to you. 111 00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.469 hudasiraj: Okay, wait, I think on the website. They said something about 112 00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.649 hudasiraj: who can give it? 113 00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.430 hudasiraj: I think I can in maybe inquire with what like 114 00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.983 hudasiraj: my counselor, maybe, or like 115 00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.980 hudasiraj: or someone like one of the school admin and see if they know anything about it. 116 00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:26.232 Jenny Duan: Okay? Then I feel like we shouldn't necessarily bank on that for national merit. 117 00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:34.129 Jenny Duan: how confident are you that you will be able to attain semi finalist status. I think everyone who reaches the score cut off attains it 118 00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.420 Jenny Duan: so. 119 00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.850 hudasiraj: Yeah, Adam. 120 00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.059 hudasiraj: I don't know how it works, but 121 00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.710 hudasiraj: but I did get like a 122 00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.620 Jenny Duan: Did he get a what. 123 00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:55.119 hudasiraj: I I got a 1420 on it, and then I think I think 124 00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.059 hudasiraj: I think that's like above the cutoff score, and then. 125 00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.349 Jenny Duan: Let's see 126 00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.880 Jenny Duan: California cutoff score. 127 00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:08.079 hudasiraj: Oh, like, I think it's like the index. It's based on the index. 128 00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.539 Jenny Duan: You know what your index is? Did it tell you. 129 00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.387 hudasiraj: Yeah, let me check 130 00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.799 hudasiraj: So then my index was a 2, 1, 2, 0, 9. 131 00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.619 Jenny Duan: Okay, so 132 00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.929 Jenny Duan: let's see. 133 00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.190 Jenny Duan: commended. 134 00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.709 hudasiraj: Okay. It says that is, it's like. 135 00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:35.139 Jenny Duan: Okay? I think that. Okay, then we can't really bank on your. 136 00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.130 Jenny Duan: So my finalist. 137 00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.160 Jenny Duan: let me see, because 138 00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.980 Jenny Duan: national merit semifinalists in California is competitive. 139 00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.570 Jenny Duan: let's see. 140 00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.870 Jenny Duan: California is, yeah, no. The selection index for California is 2 21. 141 00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.800 Jenny Duan: so 142 00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.389 Jenny Duan: I think that'll probably be tough 143 00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.680 Jenny Duan: for national. 144 00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that means we still need to do 2 more awards. 145 00:18:12.956 --> 00:18:19.293 Jenny Duan: I think at this point your best shot is probably gonna be to apply to different. 146 00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:35.546 Jenny Duan: I think. Well, for a lot of the national scholarships and awards like the semi finalist, everything comes out in December, but I I think that will be enough time for your regular decision. Applications like our scholarship tracker that we made. But I think for your early applications. 147 00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:42.329 Jenny Duan: you may not be able to have that on there, like those new awards or scholarships on there. So 148 00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:48.529 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that influences your perception of whether you want to apply to Stanford early on 149 00:18:49.490 --> 00:19:02.389 Jenny Duan: or later, because you might want to have more words on your profile. But I think that what we can do right now for you is, look at different essay or writing contests, because those things tend to have like a shorter timeline 150 00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.759 Jenny Duan: in terms of like winning the award. 151 00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.500 Jenny Duan: So let's do a search, maybe together and see 152 00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.522 Jenny Duan: yeah, and see what? 153 00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.819 Jenny Duan: how that's going. 154 00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.370 Jenny Duan: So 155 00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.669 Jenny Duan: let me look up some writing contests. 156 00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.856 hudasiraj: Oh, yeah, also. 157 00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:35.821 hudasiraj: so regarding like we were talking yesterday about the extracurriculars and how we needed to more 158 00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:59.880 hudasiraj: and then or not yesterday. Sorry last time, and then so I asked my dad if he like knew anyone that needed that could like get me an internship at their company, and then he asked me, like which one cause he has, like 2 connections that might be interested, and one of them is like like a b 2 b company. I think it's I think it's like 159 00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:12.429 hudasiraj: like a construction like some site or something like that, like kind of providing materials. And then another one is like a like a texting slash, like social media. 160 00:20:12.764 --> 00:20:20.549 hudasiraj: And then he was asking me to ask your advice, for like which one like would be like better on my profile. 161 00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.970 Jenny Duan: Which one interests you more. 162 00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:42.249 hudasiraj: I think, like both of them, are interesting. But I I just don't know. I think if I were to go forward with the like the kind of B Twob website. Then I'd be, I'd be more like in expertise with like the front end cause I don't know anything about like chatting and like back end. So 163 00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.590 hudasiraj: yeah. 164 00:20:47.440 --> 00:21:01.419 Jenny Duan: Okay? Then, I think, go with the one that you're more interested in. I think that like honestly, it doesn't make a difference, really for your application, which one you decide to go with? And then, did you decide that you want to do an internship? Is that something that you feel like you want to do. 165 00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.060 hudasiraj: Yeah, I think that'd be a good idea if I if I'm given the opportunity. Then I definitely want to. 166 00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.490 Jenny Duan: Do you know what type of tasks you would be able to do there, and like what your scope of work would look like. 167 00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:18.409 hudasiraj: Not exactly like my dad hasn't inquired yet, but like I most likely it'll probably be like web development. 168 00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.510 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that sounds cool. How does 169 00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:27.540 Jenny Duan: how do you feel about doing the internship versus like building off of your own web development services? Slash, consulting. 170 00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.980 hudasiraj: I think like 171 00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:48.350 hudasiraj: just doing it on myself. I feel like it might be like a little less like credible, or like not just credible, but like it's like less reliable for me to like, actually get people to like get my service. And also I'm just kind of 172 00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:58.660 hudasiraj: a little more commitment cause like it's like something that I'm like doing on my own. So I think maybe like an internship might be better. 173 00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:16.806 Jenny Duan: That seems good, I think, as long as you're able to contribute like real work instead of just doing random tasks, and I think you should be. I think that doing an internship is a good idea, and as long as it also doesn't get in the way of like you pursuing your other 174 00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:23.175 Jenny Duan: like your other extracurriculars, or your other progress. So if you were to start, when would you start? And 175 00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:28.280 Jenny Duan: yeah, do you know, like how much flexibility you have in choosing what you're doing. 176 00:22:28.926 --> 00:22:29.680 hudasiraj: I think 177 00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:37.980 hudasiraj: I don't know about flexibility. But I know, like I probably start once I get back from London. So probably like 178 00:22:38.230 --> 00:23:03.379 hudasiraj: like July, like 12th or so, and then maybe like, take a pause for J camp, and then like start back up once, like college is around. And but I think, like the only problem with that is like this year is gonna be really hectic, especially with, like all the essays, and like the 5 Ap's and everything. So I don't know if that's like the best fit. And I was also thinking about like what you said of working at like a like an actual job. 179 00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:08.709 hudasiraj: And oh, yeah, like, you said, I don't need a jump permit. But yeah. And like. 180 00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:20.110 hudasiraj: I think with that one it might be a little more flexible, and I could just like work on the weekends. But then, but then, like my dad was wondering like if that had any value like in like my profile. So. 181 00:23:20.484 --> 00:23:23.400 hudasiraj: yeah, like, he also was curious to see, like. 182 00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:27.150 hudasiraj: why are we like applying to jobs like now. 183 00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.670 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah, makes sense. 184 00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.459 Jenny Duan: I think that if you have to take so much time off and start to so late. 185 00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:53.680 Jenny Duan: I think that it might be better to spin this into like instead of you interviewing at this company. It could be like you're consulting for them through your website, web dev thing like have it as a smaller part of your web. Dev initiative rather than like an internship there, just because I think that the dates will seem a little bit funky. 186 00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.620 hudasiraj: okay, that makes sense. 187 00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:06.909 hudasiraj: And do you think, do you think? Like, I should still fall through with like the like the actual job or do you think I don't need to apply to that. 188 00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.290 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think that, like 189 00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:21.129 Jenny Duan: I personally like a proponent of getting jobs like, I have worked in various things like I've worked since I was 16, basically nonstop. 190 00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:38.529 Jenny Duan: And I think that's like helped me a lot like both just learning, but also like growing as a person. And so I think, like finding some sort of job where you're like responsible for turning in tasks like outside of school, is kind of interesting. But like that doesn't necessarily have to be like a Photoshop job that could be like. 191 00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.690 Jenny Duan: you're doing other things as well. 192 00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.650 Jenny Duan: Eleanor. 193 00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.709 Jenny Duan: but I don't know. Do you think it's feasible for you to hold a job. 194 00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:56.729 hudasiraj: I think it should be, I think, like my sisters actually worked there before when she was in high school. And they're like a lot more flexible than like an actual solid job. 195 00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:07.469 hudasiraj: So I think I think I want to apply cause. Then I think it's like the most like normal thing that I'm doing right now because of like the 5 Ap's are kind of 196 00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.580 hudasiraj: none of my friends are doing it. But everyone's working. But yeah. 197 00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, cool 198 00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.500 Jenny Duan: And 199 00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:27.420 Jenny Duan: I think that like, if you are able to do it. And you seem like, and you don't think that, like your travel is going to get in the way, then it shouldn't be an issue. Why don't you just submit an application? And if you get the job and don't want to do it. You don't have to do it. 200 00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.069 hudasiraj: For him. 201 00:25:28.845 --> 00:25:29.520 hudasiraj: Yes. 202 00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:45.927 Jenny Duan: Okay. But back on the awards. So we still have a whole of like 2 major awards that need to be filled ideally like you get you progress in these scholarship applications that we'll be doing and like we can count that as an award. But that's not gonna come in time for your 203 00:25:46.400 --> 00:26:02.019 Jenny Duan: That's not gonna be there in time for your early applications. So that means that we need to take advantage of the summer to do like some research and preparation there. So let me see web design and competitions. High school student, let me see what types of 204 00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.619 Jenny Duan: let me see what types of things are out there? 205 00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:25.882 hudasiraj: So so so actually, the majorly hack hackathons like they have like this thing where like organizations can like partner with them, or like become like Mlh. Members. I think. 206 00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:35.570 hudasiraj: in order to like run a hackathon and I was thinking of applying to that like, do you think that would count as an extracurricular, or like an award. 207 00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:40.380 Jenny Duan: If you win, I don't think I think it'll be an award if you don't, then 208 00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.859 Jenny Duan: I think it. 209 00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:46.560 hudasiraj: I think it's like more of a wait. I think I could send the link of the 210 00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.095 hudasiraj: I think this is actually, I think it might be more of like 211 00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.500 hudasiraj: like an award for empower. Yeah, if we do run a hackathon. But 212 00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.580 hudasiraj: yeah. 213 00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.470 hudasiraj: like more of a qualification than an award actually. 214 00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.969 Jenny Duan: What would be the qualification joining as a member. 215 00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.991 hudasiraj: Yeah, having like a having like a 216 00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.150 hudasiraj: mlh, like Member event, not hosting one. 217 00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.626 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I I don't know if that would count as an award, but I think that I could 218 00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.719 Jenny Duan: support your your application like at your activities. Description. 219 00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.669 hudasiraj: okay, I think I'll I think 220 00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:18.820 hudasiraj: we wanna have like a hackathon in late July and then I think this one takes a little longer, so we'll apply now, and we might hold another one in August. Like just one weekend, and then that one would be like supported by Emily, and maybe that that'll be in time for college applications as well. So yeah, 221 00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.796 Jenny Duan: It sounds good, but we still need to. 222 00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.600 Jenny Duan: you still need 2 things. 223 00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:31.699 Jenny Duan: So I'm still looking online, for I think it'd be cool for you to do like a web design competition. 224 00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:37.260 Jenny Duan: I mean doing more hackathons is always a good idea. 225 00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.399 Jenny Duan: Are there any hackathons that you've been interested in? 226 00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:56.199 hudasiraj: I've been like there is some that I post on like empowering and AI, and I think I can probably like enroll in those I post like 5. So let me actually go to them. Some of them are for like social good and open to beginners. 227 00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.670 hudasiraj: So I think 228 00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.379 hudasiraj: I think there's 1 229 00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.190 hudasiraj: there's like 230 00:29:04.127 --> 00:29:05.799 hudasiraj: next step hacks 231 00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:09.890 hudasiraj: waffle hacks. I think I can apply to like a couple. 232 00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.149 hudasiraj: maybe doing one project, and then, just like, submit it to multiple. 233 00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems that seems good. 234 00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.756 Jenny Duan: How do you like? 235 00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.920 Jenny Duan: Hello! 236 00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.320 Jenny Duan: National Scholastic Press Association awards? Have you heard of those. 237 00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.839 hudasiraj: Oh, I haven't. 238 00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me look. 239 00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.860 Jenny Duan: I'm also looking at some more design competitions 240 00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.670 Jenny Duan: to see if you could do like a graphic design 241 00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.210 Jenny Duan: of edition. 242 00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.840 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 243 00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.810 Jenny Duan: How do you like graphic design as a pure form of art? 244 00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:00.060 hudasiraj: I really like I think it's I think it's really fun. And it definitely helps me when I'm doing web development. 245 00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.331 Jenny Duan: Okay, right here is 246 00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.749 Jenny Duan: You can see like there's a ton of contests here. 247 00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.820 Jenny Duan: I would highly recommend submitting to these. 248 00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.190 Jenny Duan: these are all open. 249 00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.256 hudasiraj: Oh, okay. 250 00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.849 Jenny Duan: Like. For example, the art moves billboard art competition like. 251 00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.640 Jenny Duan: you can just take a look at these and see what's interesting to you. 252 00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.815 hudasiraj: Oh, okay, I think I'd definitely be interested in 253 00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.660 hudasiraj: flying for one of these. 254 00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:38.240 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 255 00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.589 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay, so I would say, look at those. And then 256 00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.300 Jenny Duan: that's 257 00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:09.830 Jenny Duan: that's that. 258 00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.700 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then for the writing journalism awards, let me take a look. 259 00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.480 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 260 00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.169 Jenny Duan: Do you do any like deep dive journalism for student news? 261 00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:05.593 hudasiraj: No, not really. 262 00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.699 Jenny Duan: There's this, like the National Scholastic Press Association. 263 00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.910 Jenny Duan: they have. Some awards open. 264 00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.639 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could. You could apply for like the leadership 265 00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.780 Jenny Duan: award in student journalism. 266 00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.250 hudasiraj: Oh, yeah. Hmm. 267 00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.180 Jenny Duan: Oh. 268 00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.010 Jenny Duan: because already passed 269 00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.920 Jenny Duan: past Deadline. 270 00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.779 hudasiraj: Oh, I think my! I think my dad found some like 271 00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.177 hudasiraj: he did some 272 00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.460 hudasiraj: like information on the few. 273 00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.380 Jenny Duan: You. 274 00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.340 hudasiraj: Startups. 275 00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:12.449 Jenny Duan: I think that the 1st startup looks interesting. 276 00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.460 Jenny Duan: Let me check out playlab.ai. 277 00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:20.019 Jenny Duan: that one could also be interesting. But I think the social media one. I think that seems really interesting. 278 00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:25.710 Jenny Duan: The play lob is is cool, too, because that you're interested in education so that could be a good fit 279 00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.750 Jenny Duan: for you. So I'd say one of those 2 if you could just pick one. But I think 280 00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.040 Jenny Duan: it's probably gonna be more impactful for you because you're 281 00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:50.460 Jenny Duan: depending on what size these startups are. It might be better for you to include this as part of your web development thing rather than like as an internship in and of itself, unless these companies raise a lot of money in the next couple of months, or grow a lot in the next couple of months, because of your own timing. 282 00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:58.260 hudasiraj: Correct. If like, I'll put like internship or like. I feel like if we have like the title, as 283 00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:03.159 hudasiraj: like an internship at a company when when that sounds stronger than just like some 284 00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.969 hudasiraj: freelance web developing. 285 00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.516 Jenny Duan: Not necessarily 286 00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:21.410 Jenny Duan: because it depends on it depends on the company. So if the company, if no one's really heard of the company, and if it's not credible like, if it's just starting without any like venture funding or any growth or anything like no one's heard of it, then 287 00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:39.650 Jenny Duan: I'd say it's probably better to loop it in with web development, because then you can showcase your other projects and like your skills in that realm. But if the startup happens to be like super developed and like, if it's, you know, done something like white combinator or like has raised a lot of money, then that is more valuable. 288 00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:44.070 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense, or is does that distinction still confusing. 289 00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:57.180 hudasiraj: Wait so when like putting it in your extracurriculars? What do we put the title as would it like? Would it be about freelance, or would it be like consulting or. 290 00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:04.190 Jenny Duan: You can call up, I think, whatever you want you can say, like web development, consulting freelance web development. They mean pretty much the same thing. 291 00:35:06.293 --> 00:35:11.389 hudasiraj: yeah, I'm just trying to figure out like the most powerful like wording, maybe that we can put 292 00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.175 hudasiraj: but 293 00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.200 hudasiraj: yeah, then yeah. And my dad thinks like, the ad tech one is the best as well. 294 00:35:19.944 --> 00:35:20.309 hudasiraj: Yeah. 295 00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.930 Jenny Duan: That one. It seems like a good fit for you. 296 00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.109 hudasiraj: Yeah. 297 00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:45.619 Jenny Duan: I think, like. The only reason why I don't wanna necessarily put it as an internship on its own is because the timeline is too short. So this little bit suspicious, because, like, you're not gonna be able to do that much, given the short timeline. So if we loop in and we want a way to showcase your other web development projects. So if we put them all in together like that can be the best, maybe the best. But it depends on. 298 00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:54.599 Jenny Duan: and I don't know, maybe know enough about the company. So I would have to research this later. But it depends on how big this company is, and like how well known or successful it would be. 299 00:35:55.476 --> 00:36:24.640 hudasiraj: And what what if like they have like different tasks for me, like maybe, since they're an AI company like what if they kind of like help me with like the AI aspect of it, or like, have me help them with the AI aspect of it. Rather than the web development. What is like I obviously still can't put that under unlike my web development, so the only option would be to put it under like an internship with them. So what do you suggest? Like anything different for that? 300 00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.799 Jenny Duan: What do you mean? 301 00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:40.570 hudasiraj: Like and like putting it in the profile, like perhaps like, say, like, they don't have me helping with like the web development. But they have me helping with something else. Like. What would I put that as when like. 302 00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:46.234 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Maybe like, depending on the scope of your work we can also talk about if you want to label it as in as in 303 00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.920 Jenny Duan: Was it extracurricular or a new initiative? An internship? But 304 00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:56.670 Jenny Duan: I think it depends again on like how much room you have left in your list, and what your other priorities are at that point. 305 00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.340 hudasiraj: okay. 306 00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:07.299 Jenny Duan: So if we count, like either an internship or web development as one of your extracurriculars, we still have one more extracurricular to put in. 307 00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:15.870 Jenny Duan: I I think that getting involved with something government related would be like really powerful, especially education policy. So I still want to continue pushing for that. 308 00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.569 Jenny Duan: I want you to 309 00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:23.829 Jenny Duan: like. Is there any other way you could maybe get involved with like local regional legislation or policy groups. 310 00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.659 hudasiraj: Okay, I think the other day I saw 311 00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.509 hudasiraj: I saw one of my classmates on Linkedin, and she 312 00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.050 hudasiraj: posted like she was like part of. 313 00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.996 hudasiraj: Let me find here. Let me do this. 314 00:37:50.085 --> 00:37:52.710 hudasiraj: yeah. She had some sort of like 315 00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:58.980 hudasiraj: experience. I think she's an intern for Josh Becker. I don't know how she was able to get it. But. 316 00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.320 hudasiraj: bum! 317 00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.390 hudasiraj: I think 318 00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.299 hudasiraj: this could be a possibility. 319 00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:15.879 Jenny Duan: I would do something like this. Maybe not. Well, Josh Becker, I would contact him. 320 00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.510 Jenny Duan: you should submit that. Yeah. 321 00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.180 Jenny Duan: And then see? Like. 322 00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.000 Jenny Duan: oh, okay. 323 00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.940 hudasiraj: Oh! 324 00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.859 Jenny Duan: Have we talked? I feel like we've talked about reaching out to your Senators and like 325 00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:34.079 Jenny Duan: Congress people and all of that, have you? Reached out to any of the other ones. 326 00:38:35.244 --> 00:38:44.240 hudasiraj: I don't. I don't remember talking about that. But yeah, like, I think this is our the representative for our district. I think. 327 00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, so this is the Senator. What about the like Congress? 328 00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.269 Jenny Duan: Or like House of Representatives. 329 00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.889 Jenny Duan: That's the Senator. Yeah. Representative. 330 00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.130 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh! I need to maintain their sites better. 331 00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.509 Jenny Duan: You made their website. That wouldn't happen. 332 00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.370 hudasiraj: Oh! 333 00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:54.580 Jenny Duan: Perfect. 334 00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.300 hudasiraj: Oh. 335 00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.780 hudasiraj: okay, wait. There's time for fall. 336 00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:17.500 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I would definitely apply to that. Then that seems like a good opportunity. Let's do that right now. 337 00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.679 Jenny Duan: I could fill up your last slot, too. 338 00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.973 Jenny Duan: Are there any other clubs that you're particularly involved in? Or is 339 00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:33.129 Jenny Duan: our folklift? No, not folklift. Sorry? Or is film club your main club. Do you have any other clubs that you're involved with? 340 00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.010 hudasiraj: I 341 00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.794 hudasiraj: I don't. I'm not really part of many clubs. 342 00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.590 hudasiraj: I think. 343 00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.790 hudasiraj: like I have friends and other clubs, and I'm going to join them, for, like my friends, but I haven't 344 00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.530 hudasiraj: really been active in any other ones. 345 00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.799 hudasiraj: just cause they weren't like a really a priority. 346 00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.085 hudasiraj: Alright, 347 00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.060 Jenny Duan: Okay? 348 00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:13.610 Jenny Duan: then, yeah. In that case, if you're not super involved in any clubs, and I think this can fill up the last spot on your extracurriculars list, then. 349 00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:23.030 Jenny Duan: So what we filled for those last 2 spots were this and the either the web development or the internship depending on how we want to word it 350 00:41:24.404 --> 00:41:25.540 Jenny Duan: and 351 00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.790 Jenny Duan: in that case, like. 352 00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:34.810 Jenny Duan: do you have any other questions on planning your extracurriculars, or what you need to do on that front? 353 00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:49.539 hudasiraj: Is there anything like I can do in the meantime? If I or like, is there anything I can do like as a precaution. If I don't get this like internship cause I'm I feel like it might be a little 354 00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.439 hudasiraj: I guess a competitive. So maybe if we could think of like a plan. 355 00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:01.225 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that a real job is another option. Another option is 356 00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.750 Jenny Duan: trying to 357 00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:10.457 Jenny Duan: join, like an existing nonprofit on their leadership board. But I feel like that. We can also think about 358 00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.180 Jenny Duan: We can also brainstorm that now, because I feel like that could also be useful. Now. 359 00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.846 Jenny Duan: like you. I think you should find out whether 360 00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:25.050 Jenny Duan: in code justice, California has a branch, and if you can join that in a leadership role. 361 00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:29.620 Jenny Duan: That would be an option. Another option is 362 00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:34.189 Jenny Duan: to see if there's any way you could get more involved with the Youth Action Committee. 363 00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.910 Jenny Duan: because that's also tied in with. 364 00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:42.360 hudasiraj: Okay, we have to fill. 365 00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.109 Jenny Duan: Hey? Yeah. That seems good. 366 00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.539 hudasiraj: Do that like I feel like if I say my Major, they might not 367 00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.389 Jenny Duan: Not a college student, so you don't need to say a major. 368 00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:06.230 hudasiraj: Yeah. 369 00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.140 hudasiraj: Pope. 370 00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.605 hudasiraj: okay, 371 00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.789 hudasiraj: do. I feel like. 372 00:44:33.342 --> 00:44:35.550 Jenny Duan: I think you can 373 00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:43.480 Jenny Duan: bullet point it, but I think, like you should think about a system of organization, and also do this rather than in the portal. 374 00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:44.700 hudasiraj: Okay. 375 00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:08.910 hudasiraj: right? 376 00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:32.319 hudasiraj: Actually, I don't know if I'd be able to do this because it's during fall, and that's like, when I'm at school. 377 00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.460 hudasiraj: Then Monday to Friday. 378 00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:41.839 hudasiraj: Would like if I got into this program. But I'm like I'm not able to do it. 379 00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.079 hudasiraj: Will that still count as something or no? 380 00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:50.870 Jenny Duan: No, but I mean you. You just need to note your availability during open office hours 381 00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.419 Jenny Duan: like, when does school end for you? 382 00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.570 Jenny Duan: Or when does school start for you? 383 00:45:55.570 --> 00:46:00.270 hudasiraj: It ends at around 4, but then also, San Francisco is like an like. 384 00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but you don't have to go in the office. You could do zoom. 385 00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.839 hudasiraj: I think it's like, I think it's in person. 386 00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.080 Jenny Duan: Tea. 387 00:46:13.341 --> 00:46:15.810 Jenny Duan: I think you should still apply 388 00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.729 Jenny Duan: and see. 389 00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.140 hudasiraj: So what do I say? Here, then. 390 00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.329 Jenny Duan: I think you would say. 391 00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:35.430 Jenny Duan: What time does school start? 392 00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.220 hudasiraj: It starts at 8, 30. 393 00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.049 Jenny Duan: Do you say? 4 to 5, 30 every day. 394 00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.150 hudasiraj: yeah. Ends at 4. 395 00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.450 hudasiraj: Monday, 4 to 5, 30. 396 00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:48.250 Jenny Duan: Happy day. 397 00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that might be too tight to be honest. 398 00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.279 Jenny Duan: okay, that might be too tight. 399 00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:02.809 Jenny Duan: I feel like, can you go on a local, more local level. So like beyond 400 00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:08.949 Jenny Duan: this, like, does the mayor have any internship opportunities? And can you get involved with the smaller, more local office. 401 00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:11.730 hudasiraj: Hmm. 402 00:48:04.943 --> 00:48:05.749 hudasiraj: I think 403 00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.930 hudasiraj: the best bet is going to like the Youth Action Committee meetings. Maybe. 404 00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.519 Jenny Duan: Okay, then that seems like, 405 00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.739 Jenny Duan: that seems like a good idea. 406 00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:23.389 Jenny Duan: I think that like I would see how you could get more involved with that 407 00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:29.099 Jenny Duan: like, for example, can you take a leadership role within the Youth Action Committee? And what would that look like. 408 00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:37.920 hudasiraj: I don't think I'd be able to take a have like a leadership position now, because there have been people that have been like a part of it since like middle school. 409 00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.469 hudasiraj: And so those are the kind of people that get like the leadership 410 00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:48.101 hudasiraj: positions. And I don't think it was like a specific application process like it. It's just 411 00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.809 hudasiraj: We kind of just self appoint leaders. 412 00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.229 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is not as impressive 413 00:48:54.440 --> 00:49:12.750 Jenny Duan: on your application. How do you feel about hackathons? Because I, personally still think that hackathons like especially Hack Club, is a really like, I feel like I've told. I've been talking about this for like years, but I do really think that Hack club is something that could be really strong on your application, and something that you personally enjoy as well. 414 00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:18.856 hudasiraj: Like, is there a specific action I need to take to be like to use it as an extracurricular cause, like. 415 00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.210 Jenny Duan: Their hat on. 416 00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.731 hudasiraj: Just like one or 417 00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.880 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think one is enough, especially if, like 418 00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.799 Jenny Duan: I think one is enough. I think multiple is better like, but one is enough. 419 00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:43.560 hudasiraj: Yeah, I I don't. I think at this at this time, because of there's travel. And then there's like, also J. Camp and everything. I think, like the best option is to do stuff online. And so like. 420 00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:48.260 hudasiraj: I think if I can definitely participate in like multiple online versions. But 421 00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.539 hudasiraj: like I don't think I I'd be able to do any like in person ones. 422 00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:53.670 hudasiraj: Yeah, okay. 423 00:49:53.670 --> 00:50:15.270 Jenny Duan: I think that the in person ones are also powerful, because, like, they're nice stories that you can tell people about. For example, like going camping with a bunch of coders, or like taking a train across the United States, like, I think those are all like really cool life experiences and stories. But I think like that's I don't. That's why I think that the online ones don't offer as much value, and that, like you're not able to have these experiences and meet, like specifically other high school students. 424 00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:23.979 Jenny Duan: But if that's the only option, I think that the online ones would not really necessarily be an extra curricular, but if you win an award, then that would be like 425 00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:25.559 Jenny Duan: something valuable. 426 00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.940 hudasiraj: Okay. 427 00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.050 hudasiraj: cause. Like. 428 00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:29.450 hudasiraj: yeah. Like. 429 00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:38.780 hudasiraj: as I say, that, like, it's like really hard to go to in person one especially now, because there's like already, so much traveling happening. And like 430 00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.510 hudasiraj: I won't be available for like 431 00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:47.328 hudasiraj: the hackathons especially like, I think, okay, I can like, look at some right now. 432 00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.330 Jenny Duan: Probably either the trail or there's another one that 433 00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.830 Jenny Duan: There's another one that they're throwing. That might be a better fit for you. 434 00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.090 Jenny Duan: The boreal express. Yeah, this one looks cool. 435 00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:40.649 hudasiraj: As the dawn of the full moon rises, our journey will begin. 436 00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.469 Jenny Duan: I forgot about the the the words. 437 00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:48.929 hudasiraj: In the beginning we'll scale a great cascade. 438 00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.969 hudasiraj: You know what you know. 439 00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.319 hudasiraj: Clinging to the edges of these great mountains. 440 00:51:57.202 --> 00:52:00.819 hudasiraj: That was the sun peaks above the horizon. 441 00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:09.140 hudasiraj: casting a golden glow over the valley. What vibrant colours will you see as the light leaks across the plains. 442 00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.560 hudasiraj: distant wisdom echoed through the air. 443 00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:16.310 hudasiraj: heralding the arrival of a cross-country Odyssey. 444 00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:23.000 hudasiraj: Wonderful! It's wonderful express. 445 00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.829 Jenny Duan: Okay. July 21 to 28. 446 00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:34.829 hudasiraj: So if I were to do this, I can't do like the increasing job. And also 447 00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:42.249 hudasiraj: it's like a whole nother country. So I don't know if my parents would like my mom especially would allow to go there alone. 448 00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.950 hudasiraj: The. 449 00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.560 Jenny Duan: Fair, fair fair. That's like, very fair. 450 00:52:46.261 --> 00:52:48.969 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's tough, I think. 451 00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.370 Jenny Duan: like. 452 00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.620 Jenny Duan: maybe do other ones then, or like, just don't do in person ones try to do something virtual. 453 00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:01.360 Jenny Duan: but I think, like one of my biggest regrets from high school is not doing hat club. 454 00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.040 Jenny Duan: So like, I really push other people to do it. 455 00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.679 Jenny Duan: but I think if it doesn't work, then it doesn't work. 456 00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:14.329 hudasiraj: Just like, I think, like, actually, Jake campus like my 1st time, like 457 00:53:14.883 --> 00:53:21.399 hudasiraj: being overnight away from my family. So I I don't have much experience like really being 458 00:53:21.786 --> 00:53:27.980 hudasiraj: to like going to like these in person type things, I mean, besides, like a few like like 459 00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.320 hudasiraj: cruise hacks, but that was like pretty close to home, so. 460 00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:36.029 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think cruise hacks like, have you done it? Did you do? Only one year or multiple years. 461 00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:37.720 hudasiraj: I did it once. 462 00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.040 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. 463 00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.989 Jenny Duan: The other ones are well past, I believe. 464 00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:47.170 hudasiraj: Oh! 465 00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:53.809 Jenny Duan: Don't think they have any online. 466 00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.270 hudasiraj: I think 467 00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.240 hudasiraj: they all pass. 468 00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:03.479 Jenny Duan: But they probably haven't ex released their new season yet. That's why. 469 00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.685 hudasiraj: I think there's also dev hacks which has, like 470 00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:08.950 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah. 471 00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:10.799 hudasiraj: Not the past step posts 472 00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.150 hudasiraj: sounds like a whole lot. But 473 00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.739 hudasiraj: yeah, I can enter in some of these, for, like some weekends. 474 00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:22.870 Jenny Duan: That'd be good, and I think it's be nice to get like a team to help you do it. 475 00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:23.800 hudasiraj: Too tea-. 476 00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.870 Jenny Duan: Other like interested people 477 00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.850 Jenny Duan: cause you need people who are just as committed as you. 478 00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:36.230 hudasiraj: Yeah. 479 00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:51.330 Jenny Duan: On the tick tock, I mean, not on Tiktok, on code of classy mailing list. I feel like they're always sending out like a bunch of different hackathons have you heard of, or have you done any of those, or not necessarily hackathons? But, like other coding resources or coding opportunities? Have you heard of any of those. 480 00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.949 hudasiraj: I actually don't get any emails from coda classy about that. 481 00:54:55.730 --> 00:55:00.764 Jenny Duan: Really you should well, I guess maybe after next week you'll get put on the official email list. 482 00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:04.690 Jenny Duan: But I'll let you know if anything like relevant comes up. 483 00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:05.559 hudasiraj: Isn't it? 484 00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:06.850 hudasiraj: Okay? 485 00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:16.339 hudasiraj: So I guess I'll just like Prep. I'll try to do these for the for awards. But yeah, I guess that doesn't count as like an extracurricular, but. 486 00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.860 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 487 00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:29.339 Jenny Duan: yeah, you don't have to like worry about doing all of them. I think the most important thing is like getting a good team who has the same goals as you. That way. You can like work together to try to reach those goals. 488 00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.536 hudasiraj: Okay. Yeah. 489 00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.249 Jenny Duan: Like, I think, ideally getting other people who are just as interested as you 490 00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:40.840 Jenny Duan: in doing hackathons or winning prizes at Hackathon specifically. 491 00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.330 hudasiraj: yeah, I agree. 492 00:55:44.915 --> 00:55:45.440 hudasiraj: with. 493 00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.020 Jenny Duan: So do mind when you think about that. 494 00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:51.950 hudasiraj: I don't think in person I don't. I don't know anyone who's like really committed to. 495 00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:52.720 Jenny Duan: Online. 496 00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:58.739 hudasiraj: Yeah, online. I, probably I can like find people through discord. Like, I, I feel like. 497 00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:03.440 hudasiraj: yeah, like, I don't have many like online friends, either. But we have. 498 00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:16.480 Jenny Duan: Okay? Because I think, like, what you wanna avoid is you being the one carrying the entire team the whole time, or you having to do it by yourself. So just finding, like a couple of people to help, you would be, I think, a powerful thing. And then 499 00:56:17.085 --> 00:56:21.634 Jenny Duan: so we talked about like the the extracurriculars and the 500 00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:27.869 Jenny Duan: and the awards. So going back, the awards that could be good are 501 00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:42.279 Jenny Duan: winning like a hackathon award could be like, really good for your profile. Other award the scholarships. Things could come up for regular decision, but for early action, early decision, I think 502 00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:45.720 Jenny Duan: writing contests, and I'm still looking at like. 503 00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:51.239 hudasiraj: You think like worst comes to worst, we can just use, like the Ap scholar, with distinction. 504 00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah. 505 00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.270 Jenny Duan: right? 506 00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.930 Jenny Duan: And I guess, like national merit 507 00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:58.970 Jenny Duan: like commended. 508 00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.060 Jenny Duan: although I feel like, that's 509 00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.360 Jenny Duan: yeah. 510 00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:13.890 Jenny Duan: again. 511 00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:25.569 hudasiraj: I know there's such things as designer phones. 512 00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:29.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Have you heard of that? 513 00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:34.990 hudasiraj: Yeah, I think like my sisters participated in some. So I think, hold on. 514 00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.130 hudasiraj: bum. 515 00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.220 hudasiraj: I don't know. Where do I find them? Easily. But. 516 00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:01.419 hudasiraj: yeah, I don't like. I don't know if I could find any right now, but. 517 00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:06.210 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's okay. 518 00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:20.720 Jenny Duan: the E, 519 00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:36.970 Jenny Duan: okay, this is something that I think is really cool. But this will not be applicable to you until next year. 520 00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:54.960 hudasiraj: Oh, is it a research program. 521 00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but it's for 18 and older. 522 00:58:57.550 --> 00:58:58.460 hudasiraj: Home 523 00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:00.020 hudasiraj: that sucks. 524 00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.140 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 525 00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:03.660 Jenny Duan: let's see. 526 00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.229 Jenny Duan: do you write like creative writing at all? 527 00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:12.119 hudasiraj: Yeah, I like like poetry and storytelling. 528 00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.829 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's see. 529 00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:19.649 Jenny Duan: have you thought about submitting to young art. 530 00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:23.630 hudasiraj: Younger parts. And 531 00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.719 hudasiraj: I feel like I remember that, but I don't know what it is. 532 00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.189 Jenny Duan: I already talked about it, for, like film, too, and other things. 533 00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.539 Jenny Duan: poetry is like a category, and it opens on 534 00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.850 Jenny Duan: July 11.th If you want to submit. 535 00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:39.210 hudasiraj: Oh, okay, that sounds really interesting. 536 00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:40.700 hudasiraj: Oh, had. 537 00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:43.410 hudasiraj: Yeah. 538 00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.589 Jenny Duan: And then let me see 539 00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:55.220 Jenny Duan: the national poet 540 00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:56.680 Jenny Duan: quarterly 541 00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.820 Jenny Duan: animal. 542 01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.949 Jenny Duan: This is a good one to try. 543 01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:33.360 Jenny Duan: Summer issue is due June 30.th 544 01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.490 Jenny Duan: So let's start here with awards. 545 01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:42.660 Jenny Duan: And then for extracurriculars. We want to add your hackathons and the internship. 546 01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.930 Jenny Duan: So we can do that for the extracurriculars, for now 547 01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:49.270 Jenny Duan: I actually not hackathons the internship, and then 548 01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:55.529 Jenny Duan: I think, trying to get more involved. Let's see if you have, like a science museum 549 01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.319 Jenny Duan: that could be a good one. 550 01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.660 Jenny Duan: Do you know what the Discovery center is? 551 01:01:08.346 --> 01:01:10.910 hudasiraj: Is that the one in San Francisco. 552 01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.570 Jenny Duan: No, I don't think so. 553 01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:18.019 Jenny Duan: What about Liberty Science Center? Do you know where that is? 554 01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:20.869 hudasiraj: Now let me see. 555 01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.440 Jenny Duan: Is this even near Mountain House? I need to. 556 01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:28.010 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, it's not. It's in Jersey City. 557 01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.265 hudasiraj: Oh! 558 01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.740 Jenny Duan: How far do you live from the computer History Museum? 559 01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:42.019 hudasiraj: I think I think we went on there like for a field trip. I think we live like an hour away, or an hour and a half. 560 01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah, super far. Okay. There's no science museums near Mountain House. 561 01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:48.790 hudasiraj: Yeah. 562 01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:54.850 Jenny Duan: Okay. 563 01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.060 Jenny Duan: I think that let's see for your extra figures 564 01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:05.140 Jenny Duan: I think you could use if you needed a last resort, you could put hackathons there. But I think 565 01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:09.610 Jenny Duan: the extracurricular, the last one is something we probably still need to keep brainstorming. 566 01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:15.349 Jenny Duan: We could focus our next session on going there. But I think right now, your main pressing thing is. 567 01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.500 Jenny Duan: I think you still really need to expand the impact of especially flip 568 01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:41.672 Jenny Duan: folklift and empowering AI. So continue making progress on the hackathon for empowering AI for folklift. I saw that you recently published like a Linkedin update that someone else submitted to folklift, keep on advertising folklift, and like, keep pushing on the growth of those organizations, and then I think I will do some more research, and then, like. The next time we meet we can talk more about 569 01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:45.199 Jenny Duan: Your last extracurricular window. How does that sound. 570 01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:46.630 hudasiraj: Yeah. Sounds. Great. 571 01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.870 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool any other questions. 572 01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:59.880 hudasiraj: We actually so so say if this company that my dad has like reached out to accepts me as an intern and then 573 01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.296 hudasiraj: alongside that if I were to like freelance web development 574 01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.600 hudasiraj: do you think that could be like 2 separate extracurriculars. 575 01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:17.799 Jenny Duan: I think that could be 2 separate extracurriculars. I think that it just depends on where you are at that point, if you like need an extra. Another extracurricular, or, if you're like, good by that. 576 01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.300 hudasiraj: Okay, that makes sense. 577 01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:24.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool sounds good. In that case, I think. 578 01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:30.230 Jenny Duan: yeah, if I'm actually a meeting scheduled tomorrow, I think I might need to move it into late, like later in the day. But 579 01:03:30.817 --> 01:03:33.440 Jenny Duan: does tomorrow still work for you. 580 01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.849 hudasiraj: Yeah, I think also, yeah. Later in the day also works better for me. 581 01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:41.820 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Sounds good. Then talk to you. Tomorrow. 582 01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.340 hudasiraj: Yeah, see?

How does that work? Or how? Yeah. 27 00:07:36.704 --> 00:07:42.880 hudasiraj: I use web portal to make it to be honest. But yeah, like, there's like animations on there. Yeah. 28 00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.509 Jenny Duan: Looks really nice. 29 00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.766 hudasiraj: Thank you. 30 00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.989 hudasiraj: I made a page for empowering AI, and like I I'm not done but with 31 00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.750 hudasiraj: Oh, I think I linke",
    "d this wrong page for Cynthoria. 32 00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.010 Jenny Duan: What is? Yeah, what is Synthoria's Fijian? 22. 33 00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.530 Jenny Duan: It looks different. 34 00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.569 hudasiraj: Yeah, I this is the old page that I had. I think 35 00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.999 hudasiraj: I think I named it wrong. Wait, let me. 36 00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.720 hudasiraj: Can you refresh the page. Wait, Ashley. 37 00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.940 hudasiraj: it's publishing 38 00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.390 hudasiraj: now. Yeah. 39 00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.819 hudasiraj: that should be the right one. 40 00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.429 Jenny Duan: Let me see. 41 00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.860 hudasiraj: Oh, no! That that's the wrong one. 42 00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.649 Jenny Duan: It still links to the same page that it linked before. 43 00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.529 hudasiraj: Wait. That's so strange. Okay. 44 00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.450 hudasiraj: okay, wait. Let me retry. 45 00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.870 hudasiraj: Okay, can you try refreshing now? 46 00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.480 hudasiraj: Why does it keep going. 47 00:08:56.714 --> 00:09:00.470 Jenny Duan: It still doesn't. Maybe it takes like a while to load. Do you think that's it? 48 00:09:02.123 --> 00:09:06.380 hudasiraj: I don't know. I'm I'm like linking the right thing. I'm not sure what's happening. 49 00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.139 Jenny Duan: I like the interactive, how you can kind of drag and like, move the photo when you like, drag your mouse. 50 00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.516 hudasiraj: Thank you. 51 00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.960 hudasiraj: Yeah, I don't know. That's not supposed to be there. I don't know why that's there, but. 52 00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.974 hudasiraj: Yeah, I I think I'll I'll figure it out. 53 00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.075 Jenny Duan: Okay? Then I think that 54 00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:45.859 Jenny Duan: maybe what we can talk about is with your ex",
    "tracurriculars. Remember how we talked about you are missing like one to 2 extracurriculars, and one to 2 awards. 55 00:09:46.251 --> 00:10:01.709 Jenny Duan: I think, for the award on the awards. I think that that will naturally get filled in with the national merit and also the Presidential Volunteer Service award. So I think that those will actually be taken care of because you said your score meets the cut off for national merit right. 56 00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:27.159 hudasiraj: Yeah. And also I wanted to say, like, if I'm not able to get the present cause, I don't know if we get like the Presidential scholar status before applying so if not like. This is also kind of maybe. But we could. I could possibly get the Ap Scholar with distinction award this year. If I do get some like above 3 on my ap exams. 57 00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:48.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like that is not as impressive of an award, though, as presidential volunteer service award. Just because I feel like a lot of people get that. So I think the more niche your award is where the more specific, the better. So have you heard anything from the camera impact foundation about moving to the next round yet, or I I don't even know if their 1st round's over. So. 58 00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.969 hudasiraj: No, I haven't heard anything from them. 59 00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:58.979 Jenny Duan: I think that that might be in November then, because I think that there's still cause you applied like early, but I don't know if their regular application deadline is still 60 00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.250 Jenny Duan: taking applicants. So 61 00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.699 Jenny Duan: let's see, what else would you have for your early? 62 00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.810 Jenny Duan: So why don't you think that you'll be able to secure Presidential volunteer service award? Or what is the barrier there. 63 00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:19.709 hudasiraj: It's because, like, I know, it's like I think, for seniors and I think I do",
    "n't know if they'll be able to like like 64 00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:27.439 hudasiraj: have me like name that before, like I graduate. I think that's the kind of thing that they give at graduation. I'm not sure, though. 65 00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.339 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. You see. 66 00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.729 hudasiraj: A little bit into it, so I was like, hold on! Let me go to the my school site. 67 00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.020 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 68 00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.859 hudasiraj: There's like senior awards. Let me share my screen. 69 00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.689 hudasiraj: There's Senior awards. There's I got this pathway recognition. 70 00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:00.750 hudasiraj: Huh? 71 00:12:03.977 --> 00:12:13.670 hudasiraj: Yeah. And then I think these are the community service hours awards. And I I don't know. It doesn't say anything about presidential scholar 72 00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.260 hudasiraj: And then I think you need like 73 00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.289 hudasiraj: 300 to get the 74 00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:35.110 hudasiraj: community Service Senior Award. And then, just for, like the block letter, and like the certificates, 200, but I don't know if 75 00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.790 hudasiraj: that like really means anything but 76 00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:51.020 hudasiraj: cause. I remember like people like on their Linkedin, like people from my school. I saw, like presidential scholar award, but like I'm not sure how they got those already. Oh. 77 00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.249 Jenny Duan: Do they have to do it through an external organization? Maybe. 78 00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.613 hudasiraj: Yeah. And then I went, and then I went to 79 00:13:01.056 --> 00:13:02.480 hudasiraj: Hold on, I'm gonna. 80 00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.959 Jenny Duan: Cause. I think you need to do it through a certifying organization. 81 00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.380 hudasiraj: Yeah, I think. But when I want on here, I think, like 82 00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:22",
    ".380 hudasiraj: someone else has to like, give it to you. And then and then I think you have to like, there's only like 2 options like, either you like, apply to be like an organization that can give it. Or you can like 83 00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.028 hudasiraj: actually be like the student receiving it. And 84 00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.470 Jenny Duan: Oh, this is something different. This is Presidential scholars. Presidential volunteer service award is different. 85 00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.529 hudasiraj: Sorry. I'm actually 86 00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.550 hudasiraj: okay. Yeah, this is this is what I was talking about. Then, like. 87 00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.063 hudasiraj: yeah, like, 88 00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.460 hudasiraj: like, if you apply 89 00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.390 hudasiraj: you applied through. 90 00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.269 hudasiraj: you apply as 91 00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.970 hudasiraj: I'll collect. 92 00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.360 hudasiraj: Yeah, like this is not 93 00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.910 hudasiraj: for, like the students, I think. 94 00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.750 Jenny Duan: This is for the yeah. So you need to have an organization to certify you. 95 00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.101 Jenny Duan: Does your school? So you said that your school does your school certify, or. 96 00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.811 hudasiraj: That's what I was thinking. But I'm but I'm not sure anymore, because, like, I don't. 97 00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.650 Jenny Duan: How's the people around you like, get them? 98 00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.159 Jenny Duan: Do you want to look at their maybe their Linkedin right now and see like 99 00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.400 Jenny Duan: what organization certified them. 100 00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.760 hudasiraj: I actually don't remember who 101 00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.159 hudasiraj: exactly plus phone 102 00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.279 Jenny Duan: You can. Yeah, search. 103 00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.120 Jenny Duan: w",
    "hoop. 104 00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.630 hudasiraj: I don't think this person goes to my school, but maybe their school gave it. 105 00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.790 Jenny Duan: Maybe you make a wish America would give it. 106 00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.870 Jenny Duan: Usually I feel like it's not the school that gives it. 107 00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.759 Jenny Duan: I think it's usually 108 00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.000 Jenny Duan: organization. 109 00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.120 hudasiraj: Yeah, I don't know. He doesn't give information on who gave it, but. 110 00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, so you need a certifying organization to give it to you. 111 00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.469 hudasiraj: Okay, wait, I think on the website. They said something about 112 00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.649 hudasiraj: who can give it? 113 00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.430 hudasiraj: I think I can in maybe inquire with what like 114 00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.983 hudasiraj: my counselor, maybe, or like 115 00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.980 hudasiraj: or someone like one of the school admin and see if they know anything about it. 116 00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:26.232 Jenny Duan: Okay? Then I feel like we shouldn't necessarily bank on that for national merit. 117 00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:34.129 Jenny Duan: how confident are you that you will be able to attain semi finalist status. I think everyone who reaches the score cut off attains it 118 00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.420 Jenny Duan: so. 119 00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.850 hudasiraj: Yeah, Adam. 120 00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.059 hudasiraj: I don't know how it works, but 121 00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.710 hudasiraj: but I did get like a 122 00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.620 Jenny Duan: Did he get a what. 123 00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:55.119 hudasiraj: I I got a 1420 on it, and then I think I think 124 00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.059 hudasiraj: I think that's like above the cutoff score, and then. 125 00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.349 Jenny Duan: Let's see 126",
    " 00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.880 Jenny Duan: California cutoff score. 127 00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:08.079 hudasiraj: Oh, like, I think it's like the index. It's based on the index. 128 00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.539 Jenny Duan: You know what your index is? Did it tell you. 129 00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.387 hudasiraj: Yeah, let me check 130 00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.799 hudasiraj: So then my index was a 2, 1, 2, 0, 9. 131 00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.619 Jenny Duan: Okay, so 132 00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.929 Jenny Duan: let's see. 133 00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.190 Jenny Duan: commended. 134 00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.709 hudasiraj: Okay. It says that is, it's like. 135 00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:35.139 Jenny Duan: Okay? I think that. Okay, then we can't really bank on your. 136 00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.130 Jenny Duan: So my finalist. 137 00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.160 Jenny Duan: let me see, because 138 00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.980 Jenny Duan: national merit semifinalists in California is competitive. 139 00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.570 Jenny Duan: let's see. 140 00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.870 Jenny Duan: California is, yeah, no. The selection index for California is 2 21. 141 00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.800 Jenny Duan: so 142 00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.389 Jenny Duan: I think that'll probably be tough 143 00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.680 Jenny Duan: for national. 144 00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, so that means we still need to do 2 more awards. 145 00:18:12.956 --> 00:18:19.293 Jenny Duan: I think at this point your best shot is probably gonna be to apply to different. 146 00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:35.546 Jenny Duan: I think. Well, for a lot of the national scholarships and awards like the semi finalist, everything comes out in December, but I I think that will be enough time for your regular decision. Applications like our scholarship tracker that we made. But I think for your early applications. 147 00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:42.329 Jenny Duan: you may not be able to have t",
    "hat on there, like those new awards or scholarships on there. So 148 00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:48.529 Jenny Duan: I don't know if that influences your perception of whether you want to apply to Stanford early on 149 00:18:49.490 --> 00:19:02.389 Jenny Duan: or later, because you might want to have more words on your profile. But I think that what we can do right now for you is, look at different essay or writing contests, because those things tend to have like a shorter timeline 150 00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.759 Jenny Duan: in terms of like winning the award. 151 00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.500 Jenny Duan: So let's do a search, maybe together and see 152 00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.522 Jenny Duan: yeah, and see what? 153 00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.819 Jenny Duan: how that's going. 154 00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.370 Jenny Duan: So 155 00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.669 Jenny Duan: let me look up some writing contests. 156 00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.856 hudasiraj: Oh, yeah, also. 157 00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:35.821 hudasiraj: so regarding like we were talking yesterday about the extracurriculars and how we needed to more 158 00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:59.880 hudasiraj: and then or not yesterday. Sorry last time, and then so I asked my dad if he like knew anyone that needed that could like get me an internship at their company, and then he asked me, like which one cause he has, like 2 connections that might be interested, and one of them is like like a b 2 b company. I think it's I think it's like 159 00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:12.429 hudasiraj: like a construction like some site or something like that, like kind of providing materials. And then another one is like a like a texting slash, like social media. 160 00:20:12.764 --> 00:20:20.549 hudasiraj: And then he was asking me to ask your advice, for like which one like would be like better on my profile. 161 00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.970 Jenny Duan: Which one interests you more. 162 00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:42.249 hudasiraj: I think, like both ",
    "of them, are interesting. But I I just don't know. I think if I were to go forward with the like the kind of B Twob website. Then I'd be, I'd be more like in expertise with like the front end cause I don't know anything about like chatting and like back end. So 163 00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.590 hudasiraj: yeah. 164 00:20:47.440 --> 00:21:01.419 Jenny Duan: Okay? Then, I think, go with the one that you're more interested in. I think that like honestly, it doesn't make a difference, really for your application, which one you decide to go with? And then, did you decide that you want to do an internship? Is that something that you feel like you want to do. 165 00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.060 hudasiraj: Yeah, I think that'd be a good idea if I if I'm given the opportunity. Then I definitely want to. 166 00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.490 Jenny Duan: Do you know what type of tasks you would be able to do there, and like what your scope of work would look like. 167 00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:18.409 hudasiraj: Not exactly like my dad hasn't inquired yet, but like I most likely it'll probably be like web development. 168 00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.510 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that sounds cool. How does 169 00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:27.540 Jenny Duan: how do you feel about doing the internship versus like building off of your own web development services? Slash, consulting. 170 00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.980 hudasiraj: I think like 171 00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:48.350 hudasiraj: just doing it on myself. I feel like it might be like a little less like credible, or like not just credible, but like it's like less reliable for me to like, actually get people to like get my service. And also I'm just kind of 172 00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:58.660 hudasiraj: a little more commitment cause like it's like something that I'm like doing on my own. So I think maybe like an internship might be better. 173 00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:16.806 Jenny Duan: That seems good, I think, as long as you're able to contribute like real",
    " work instead of just doing random tasks, and I think you should be. I think that doing an internship is a good idea, and as long as it also doesn't get in the way of like you pursuing your other 174 00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:23.175 Jenny Duan: like your other extracurriculars, or your other progress. So if you were to start, when would you start? And 175 00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:28.280 Jenny Duan: yeah, do you know, like how much flexibility you have in choosing what you're doing. 176 00:22:28.926 --> 00:22:29.680 hudasiraj: I think 177 00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:37.980 hudasiraj: I don't know about flexibility. But I know, like I probably start once I get back from London. So probably like 178 00:22:38.230 --> 00:23:03.379 hudasiraj: like July, like 12th or so, and then maybe like, take a pause for J camp, and then like start back up once, like college is around. And but I think, like the only problem with that is like this year is gonna be really hectic, especially with, like all the essays, and like the 5 Ap's and everything. So I don't know if that's like the best fit. And I was also thinking about like what you said of working at like a like an actual job. 179 00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:08.709 hudasiraj: And oh, yeah, like, you said, I don't need a jump permit. But yeah. And like. 180 00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:20.110 hudasiraj: I think with that one it might be a little more flexible, and I could just like work on the weekends. But then, but then, like my dad was wondering like if that had any value like in like my profile. So. 181 00:23:20.484 --> 00:23:23.400 hudasiraj: yeah, like, he also was curious to see, like. 182 00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:27.150 hudasiraj: why are we like applying to jobs like now. 183 00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.670 Jenny Duan: Right? Yeah, makes sense. 184 00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.459 Jenny Duan: I think that if you have to take so much time off and start to so late. 185 00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:53.680 Jenny Duan: I think that it might be better to spin t",
    "his into like instead of you interviewing at this company. It could be like you're consulting for them through your website, web dev thing like have it as a smaller part of your web. Dev initiative rather than like an internship there, just because I think that the dates will seem a little bit funky. 186 00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.620 hudasiraj: okay, that makes sense. 187 00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:06.909 hudasiraj: And do you think, do you think? Like, I should still fall through with like the like the actual job or do you think I don't need to apply to that. 188 00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.290 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think that, like 189 00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:21.129 Jenny Duan: I personally like a proponent of getting jobs like, I have worked in various things like I've worked since I was 16, basically nonstop. 190 00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:38.529 Jenny Duan: And I think that's like helped me a lot like both just learning, but also like growing as a person. And so I think, like finding some sort of job where you're like responsible for turning in tasks like outside of school, is kind of interesting. But like that doesn't necessarily have to be like a Photoshop job that could be like. 191 00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.690 Jenny Duan: you're doing other things as well. 192 00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.650 Jenny Duan: Eleanor. 193 00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.709 Jenny Duan: but I don't know. Do you think it's feasible for you to hold a job. 194 00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:56.729 hudasiraj: I think it should be, I think, like my sisters actually worked there before when she was in high school. And they're like a lot more flexible than like an actual solid job. 195 00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:07.469 hudasiraj: So I think I think I want to apply cause. Then I think it's like the most like normal thing that I'm doing right now because of like the 5 Ap's are kind of 196 00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.580 hudasiraj: none of my friends are doing it. But everyone's working. But yeah. 197 00:25:11.990 --> 00:",
    "25:13.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, cool 198 00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.500 Jenny Duan: And 199 00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:27.420 Jenny Duan: I think that like, if you are able to do it. And you seem like, and you don't think that, like your travel is going to get in the way, then it shouldn't be an issue. Why don't you just submit an application? And if you get the job and don't want to do it. You don't have to do it. 200 00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.069 hudasiraj: For him. 201 00:25:28.845 --> 00:25:29.520 hudasiraj: Yes. 202 00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:45.927 Jenny Duan: Okay. But back on the awards. So we still have a whole of like 2 major awards that need to be filled ideally like you get you progress in these scholarship applications that we'll be doing and like we can count that as an award. But that's not gonna come in time for your 203 00:25:46.400 --> 00:26:02.019 Jenny Duan: That's not gonna be there in time for your early applications. So that means that we need to take advantage of the summer to do like some research and preparation there. So let me see web design and competitions. High school student, let me see what types of 204 00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.619 Jenny Duan: let me see what types of things are out there? 205 00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:25.882 hudasiraj: So so so actually, the majorly hack hackathons like they have like this thing where like organizations can like partner with them, or like become like Mlh. Members. I think. 206 00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:35.570 hudasiraj: in order to like run a hackathon and I was thinking of applying to that like, do you think that would count as an extracurricular, or like an award. 207 00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:40.380 Jenny Duan: If you win, I don't think I think it'll be an award if you don't, then 208 00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.859 Jenny Duan: I think it. 209 00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:46.560 hudasiraj: I think it's like more of a wait. I think I could send the link of the 210 00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.095 hudasiraj: I think this is",
    " actually, I think it might be more of like 211 00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.500 hudasiraj: like an award for empower. Yeah, if we do run a hackathon. But 212 00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.580 hudasiraj: yeah. 213 00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.470 hudasiraj: like more of a qualification than an award actually. 214 00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.969 Jenny Duan: What would be the qualification joining as a member. 215 00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.991 hudasiraj: Yeah, having like a having like a 216 00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.150 hudasiraj: mlh, like Member event, not hosting one. 217 00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.626 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I I don't know if that would count as an award, but I think that I could 218 00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.719 Jenny Duan: support your your application like at your activities. Description. 219 00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.669 hudasiraj: okay, I think I'll I think 220 00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:18.820 hudasiraj: we wanna have like a hackathon in late July and then I think this one takes a little longer, so we'll apply now, and we might hold another one in August. Like just one weekend, and then that one would be like supported by Emily, and maybe that that'll be in time for college applications as well. So yeah, 221 00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.796 Jenny Duan: It sounds good, but we still need to. 222 00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.600 Jenny Duan: you still need 2 things. 223 00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:31.699 Jenny Duan: So I'm still looking online, for I think it'd be cool for you to do like a web design competition. 224 00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:37.260 Jenny Duan: I mean doing more hackathons is always a good idea. 225 00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.399 Jenny Duan: Are there any hackathons that you've been interested in? 226 00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:56.199 hudasiraj: I've been like there is some that I post on like empowering and AI, and I think I can probably like enroll in those I post like 5. So let me actually go to them. Some of them are for like social good and open to beginners. 227 ",
    "00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.670 hudasiraj: So I think 228 00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.379 hudasiraj: I think there's 1 229 00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.190 hudasiraj: there's like 230 00:29:04.127 --> 00:29:05.799 hudasiraj: next step hacks 231 00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:09.890 hudasiraj: waffle hacks. I think I can apply to like a couple. 232 00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.149 hudasiraj: maybe doing one project, and then, just like, submit it to multiple. 233 00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems that seems good. 234 00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.756 Jenny Duan: How do you like? 235 00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.920 Jenny Duan: Hello! 236 00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.320 Jenny Duan: National Scholastic Press Association awards? Have you heard of those. 237 00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.839 hudasiraj: Oh, I haven't. 238 00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me look. 239 00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.860 Jenny Duan: I'm also looking at some more design competitions 240 00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.670 Jenny Duan: to see if you could do like a graphic design 241 00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.210 Jenny Duan: of edition. 242 00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.840 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 243 00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.810 Jenny Duan: How do you like graphic design as a pure form of art? 244 00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:00.060 hudasiraj: I really like I think it's I think it's really fun. And it definitely helps me when I'm doing web development. 245 00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.331 Jenny Duan: Okay, right here is 246 00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.749 Jenny Duan: You can see like there's a ton of contests here. 247 00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.820 Jenny Duan: I would highly recommend submitting to these. 248 00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.190 Jenny Duan: these are all open. 249 00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.256 hudasiraj: Oh, okay. 250 00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.849 Jenny Duan: Like. For example, the art moves billboard art competition like. 251 00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.640 Jenny Duan: you can just take a look at these ",
    "and see what's interesting to you. 252 00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.815 hudasiraj: Oh, okay, I think I'd definitely be interested in 253 00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.660 hudasiraj: flying for one of these. 254 00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:38.240 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 255 00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.589 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay, so I would say, look at those. And then 256 00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.300 Jenny Duan: that's 257 00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:09.830 Jenny Duan: that's that. 258 00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.700 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then for the writing journalism awards, let me take a look. 259 00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.480 Jenny Duan: Hmm! 260 00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.169 Jenny Duan: Do you do any like deep dive journalism for student news? 261 00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:05.593 hudasiraj: No, not really. 262 00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.699 Jenny Duan: There's this, like the National Scholastic Press Association. 263 00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.910 Jenny Duan: they have. Some awards open. 264 00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.639 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could. You could apply for like the leadership 265 00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.780 Jenny Duan: award in student journalism. 266 00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.250 hudasiraj: Oh, yeah. Hmm. 267 00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.180 Jenny Duan: Oh. 268 00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.010 Jenny Duan: because already passed 269 00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.920 Jenny Duan: past Deadline. 270 00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.779 hudasiraj: Oh, I think my! I think my dad found some like 271 00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.177 hudasiraj: he did some 272 00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.460 hudasiraj: like information on the few. 273 00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.380 Jenny Duan: You. 274 00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.340 hudasiraj: Startups. 275 00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:12.449 Jenny Duan: I think that the 1st startup looks interesting. 276 00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.460 Jenny Duan: Let me check out playlab.ai. 277 00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:20.019 Jenny Duan: that one could also be interesting. But I think the social me",
    "dia one. I think that seems really interesting. 278 00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:25.710 Jenny Duan: The play lob is is cool, too, because that you're interested in education so that could be a good fit 279 00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.750 Jenny Duan: for you. So I'd say one of those 2 if you could just pick one. But I think 280 00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.040 Jenny Duan: it's probably gonna be more impactful for you because you're 281 00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:50.460 Jenny Duan: depending on what size these startups are. It might be better for you to include this as part of your web development thing rather than like as an internship in and of itself, unless these companies raise a lot of money in the next couple of months, or grow a lot in the next couple of months, because of your own timing. 282 00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:58.260 hudasiraj: Correct. If like, I'll put like internship or like. I feel like if we have like the title, as 283 00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:03.159 hudasiraj: like an internship at a company when when that sounds stronger than just like some 284 00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.969 hudasiraj: freelance web developing. 285 00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.516 Jenny Duan: Not necessarily 286 00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:21.410 Jenny Duan: because it depends on it depends on the company. So if the company, if no one's really heard of the company, and if it's not credible like, if it's just starting without any like venture funding or any growth or anything like no one's heard of it, then 287 00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:39.650 Jenny Duan: I'd say it's probably better to loop it in with web development, because then you can showcase your other projects and like your skills in that realm. But if the startup happens to be like super developed and like, if it's, you know, done something like white combinator or like has raised a lot of money, then that is more valuable. 288 00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:44.070 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense, or is does that distinction still confusing. 289 00:34:44.070",
    " --> 00:34:57.180 hudasiraj: Wait so when like putting it in your extracurriculars? What do we put the title as would it like? Would it be about freelance, or would it be like consulting or. 290 00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:04.190 Jenny Duan: You can call up, I think, whatever you want you can say, like web development, consulting freelance web development. They mean pretty much the same thing. 291 00:35:06.293 --> 00:35:11.389 hudasiraj: yeah, I'm just trying to figure out like the most powerful like wording, maybe that we can put 292 00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.175 hudasiraj: but 293 00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.200 hudasiraj: yeah, then yeah. And my dad thinks like, the ad tech one is the best as well. 294 00:35:19.944 --> 00:35:20.309 hudasiraj: Yeah. 295 00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.930 Jenny Duan: That one. It seems like a good fit for you. 296 00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.109 hudasiraj: Yeah. 297 00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:45.619 Jenny Duan: I think, like. The only reason why I don't wanna necessarily put it as an internship on its own is because the timeline is too short. So this little bit suspicious, because, like, you're not gonna be able to do that much, given the short timeline. So if we loop in and we want a way to showcase your other web development projects. So if we put them all in together like that can be the best, maybe the best. But it depends on. 298 00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:54.599 Jenny Duan: and I don't know, maybe know enough about the company. So I would have to research this later. But it depends on how big this company is, and like how well known or successful it would be. 299 00:35:55.476 --> 00:36:24.640 hudasiraj: And what what if like they have like different tasks for me, like maybe, since they're an AI company like what if they kind of like help me with like the AI aspect of it, or like, have me help them with the AI aspect of it. Rather than the web development. What is like I obviously still can't put that under unlike my web development, so the only op",
    "tion would be to put it under like an internship with them. So what do you suggest? Like anything different for that? 300 00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.799 Jenny Duan: What do you mean? 301 00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:40.570 hudasiraj: Like and like putting it in the profile, like perhaps like, say, like, they don't have me helping with like the web development. But they have me helping with something else. Like. What would I put that as when like. 302 00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:46.234 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Maybe like, depending on the scope of your work we can also talk about if you want to label it as in as in 303 00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.920 Jenny Duan: Was it extracurricular or a new initiative? An internship? But 304 00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:56.670 Jenny Duan: I think it depends again on like how much room you have left in your list, and what your other priorities are at that point. 305 00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.340 hudasiraj: okay. 306 00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:07.299 Jenny Duan: So if we count, like either an internship or web development as one of your extracurriculars, we still have one more extracurricular to put in. 307 00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:15.870 Jenny Duan: I I think that getting involved with something government related would be like really powerful, especially education policy. So I still want to continue pushing for that. 308 00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.569 Jenny Duan: I want you to 309 00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:23.829 Jenny Duan: like. Is there any other way you could maybe get involved with like local regional legislation or policy groups. 310 00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.659 hudasiraj: Okay, I think the other day I saw 311 00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.509 hudasiraj: I saw one of my classmates on Linkedin, and she 312 00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.050 hudasiraj: posted like she was like part of. 313 00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.996 hudasiraj: Let me find here. Let me do this. 314 00:37:50.085 --> 00:37:52.710 hudasiraj: yeah. She had some sort of like 315 00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:58.98",
    "0 hudasiraj: experience. I think she's an intern for Josh Becker. I don't know how she was able to get it. But. 316 00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.320 hudasiraj: bum! 317 00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.390 hudasiraj: I think 318 00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.299 hudasiraj: this could be a possibility. 319 00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:15.879 Jenny Duan: I would do something like this. Maybe not. Well, Josh Becker, I would contact him. 320 00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.510 Jenny Duan: you should submit that. Yeah. 321 00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.180 Jenny Duan: And then see? Like. 322 00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.000 Jenny Duan: oh, okay. 323 00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.940 hudasiraj: Oh! 324 00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.859 Jenny Duan: Have we talked? I feel like we've talked about reaching out to your Senators and like 325 00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:34.079 Jenny Duan: Congress people and all of that, have you? Reached out to any of the other ones. 326 00:38:35.244 --> 00:38:44.240 hudasiraj: I don't. I don't remember talking about that. But yeah, like, I think this is our the representative for our district. I think. 327 00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, so this is the Senator. What about the like Congress? 328 00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.269 Jenny Duan: Or like House of Representatives. 329 00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.889 Jenny Duan: That's the Senator. Yeah. Representative. 330 00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.130 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh! I need to maintain their sites better. 331 00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.509 Jenny Duan: You made their website. That wouldn't happen. 332 00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.370 hudasiraj: Oh! 333 00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:54.580 Jenny Duan: Perfect. 334 00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.300 hudasiraj: Oh. 335 00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.780 hudasiraj: okay, wait. There's time for fall. 336 00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:17.500 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I would definitely apply to that. Then that seems like a good opportunity. Let's do that right now. 337 00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.679 Jenny Duan: I co",
    "uld fill up your last slot, too. 338 00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.973 Jenny Duan: Are there any other clubs that you're particularly involved in? Or is 339 00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:33.129 Jenny Duan: our folklift? No, not folklift. Sorry? Or is film club your main club. Do you have any other clubs that you're involved with? 340 00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.010 hudasiraj: I 341 00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.794 hudasiraj: I don't. I'm not really part of many clubs. 342 00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.590 hudasiraj: I think. 343 00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.790 hudasiraj: like I have friends and other clubs, and I'm going to join them, for, like my friends, but I haven't 344 00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.530 hudasiraj: really been active in any other ones. 345 00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.799 hudasiraj: just cause they weren't like a really a priority. 346 00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.085 hudasiraj: Alright, 347 00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.060 Jenny Duan: Okay? 348 00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:13.610 Jenny Duan: then, yeah. In that case, if you're not super involved in any clubs, and I think this can fill up the last spot on your extracurriculars list, then. 349 00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:23.030 Jenny Duan: So what we filled for those last 2 spots were this and the either the web development or the internship depending on how we want to word it 350 00:41:24.404 --> 00:41:25.540 Jenny Duan: and 351 00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.790 Jenny Duan: in that case, like. 352 00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:34.810 Jenny Duan: do you have any other questions on planning your extracurriculars, or what you need to do on that front? 353 00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:49.539 hudasiraj: Is there anything like I can do in the meantime? If I or like, is there anything I can do like as a precaution. If I don't get this like internship cause I'm I feel like it might be a little 354 00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.439 hudasiraj: I guess a competitive. So maybe if we could think of like a plan. 355 00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:01.225 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that",
    " a real job is another option. Another option is 356 00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.750 Jenny Duan: trying to 357 00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:10.457 Jenny Duan: join, like an existing nonprofit on their leadership board. But I feel like that. We can also think about 358 00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.180 Jenny Duan: We can also brainstorm that now, because I feel like that could also be useful. Now. 359 00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.846 Jenny Duan: like you. I think you should find out whether 360 00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:25.050 Jenny Duan: in code justice, California has a branch, and if you can join that in a leadership role. 361 00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:29.620 Jenny Duan: That would be an option. Another option is 362 00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:34.189 Jenny Duan: to see if there's any way you could get more involved with the Youth Action Committee. 363 00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.910 Jenny Duan: because that's also tied in with. 364 00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:42.360 hudasiraj: Okay, we have to fill. 365 00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.109 Jenny Duan: Hey? Yeah. That seems good. 366 00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.539 hudasiraj: Do that like I feel like if I say my Major, they might not 367 00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.389 Jenny Duan: Not a college student, so you don't need to say a major. 368 00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:06.230 hudasiraj: Yeah. 369 00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.140 hudasiraj: Pope. 370 00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.605 hudasiraj: okay, 371 00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.789 hudasiraj: do. I feel like. 372 00:44:33.342 --> 00:44:35.550 Jenny Duan: I think you can 373 00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:43.480 Jenny Duan: bullet point it, but I think, like you should think about a system of organization, and also do this rather than in the portal. 374 00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:44.700 hudasiraj: Okay. 375 00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:08.910 hudasiraj: right? 376 00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:32.319 hudasiraj: Actually, I don't know if I'd be able to do this because it's during fall, and that's like, when I'm at school. 377 00:45:32.550 --> 00",
    ":45:34.460 hudasiraj: Then Monday to Friday. 378 00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:41.839 hudasiraj: Would like if I got into this program. But I'm like I'm not able to do it. 379 00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.079 hudasiraj: Will that still count as something or no? 380 00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:50.870 Jenny Duan: No, but I mean you. You just need to note your availability during open office hours 381 00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.419 Jenny Duan: like, when does school end for you? 382 00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.570 Jenny Duan: Or when does school start for you? 383 00:45:55.570 --> 00:46:00.270 hudasiraj: It ends at around 4, but then also, San Francisco is like an like. 384 00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but you don't have to go in the office. You could do zoom. 385 00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.839 hudasiraj: I think it's like, I think it's in person. 386 00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.080 Jenny Duan: Tea. 387 00:46:13.341 --> 00:46:15.810 Jenny Duan: I think you should still apply 388 00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.729 Jenny Duan: and see. 389 00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.140 hudasiraj: So what do I say? Here, then. 390 00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.329 Jenny Duan: I think you would say. 391 00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:35.430 Jenny Duan: What time does school start? 392 00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.220 hudasiraj: It starts at 8, 30. 393 00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.049 Jenny Duan: Do you say? 4 to 5, 30 every day. 394 00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.150 hudasiraj: yeah. Ends at 4. 395 00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.450 hudasiraj: Monday, 4 to 5, 30. 396 00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:48.250 Jenny Duan: Happy day. 397 00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.420 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that might be too tight to be honest. 398 00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.279 Jenny Duan: okay, that might be too tight. 399 00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:02.809 Jenny Duan: I feel like, can you go on a local, more local level. So like beyond 400 00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:08.949 Jenny Duan: this, like, does the mayor have any internship opportunities? And can you get involv",
    "ed with the smaller, more local office. 401 00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:11.730 hudasiraj: Hmm. 402 00:48:04.943 --> 00:48:05.749 hudasiraj: I think 403 00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.930 hudasiraj: the best bet is going to like the Youth Action Committee meetings. Maybe. 404 00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.519 Jenny Duan: Okay, then that seems like, 405 00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.739 Jenny Duan: that seems like a good idea. 406 00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:23.389 Jenny Duan: I think that like I would see how you could get more involved with that 407 00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:29.099 Jenny Duan: like, for example, can you take a leadership role within the Youth Action Committee? And what would that look like. 408 00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:37.920 hudasiraj: I don't think I'd be able to take a have like a leadership position now, because there have been people that have been like a part of it since like middle school. 409 00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.469 hudasiraj: And so those are the kind of people that get like the leadership 410 00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:48.101 hudasiraj: positions. And I don't think it was like a specific application process like it. It's just 411 00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.809 hudasiraj: We kind of just self appoint leaders. 412 00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.229 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is not as impressive 413 00:48:54.440 --> 00:49:12.750 Jenny Duan: on your application. How do you feel about hackathons? Because I, personally still think that hackathons like especially Hack Club, is a really like, I feel like I've told. I've been talking about this for like years, but I do really think that Hack club is something that could be really strong on your application, and something that you personally enjoy as well. 414 00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:18.856 hudasiraj: Like, is there a specific action I need to take to be like to use it as an extracurricular cause, like. 415 00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.210 Jenny Duan: Their hat on. 416 00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.731 hudasiraj: Just like one or 417 0",
    "0:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.880 Jenny Duan: I mean, I think one is enough, especially if, like 418 00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.799 Jenny Duan: I think one is enough. I think multiple is better like, but one is enough. 419 00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:43.560 hudasiraj: Yeah, I I don't. I think at this at this time, because of there's travel. And then there's like, also J. Camp and everything. I think, like the best option is to do stuff online. And so like. 420 00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:48.260 hudasiraj: I think if I can definitely participate in like multiple online versions. But 421 00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.539 hudasiraj: like I don't think I I'd be able to do any like in person ones. 422 00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:53.670 hudasiraj: Yeah, okay. 423 00:49:53.670 --> 00:50:15.270 Jenny Duan: I think that the in person ones are also powerful, because, like, they're nice stories that you can tell people about. For example, like going camping with a bunch of coders, or like taking a train across the United States, like, I think those are all like really cool life experiences and stories. But I think like that's I don't. That's why I think that the online ones don't offer as much value, and that, like you're not able to have these experiences and meet, like specifically other high school students. 424 00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:23.979 Jenny Duan: But if that's the only option, I think that the online ones would not really necessarily be an extra curricular, but if you win an award, then that would be like 425 00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:25.559 Jenny Duan: something valuable. 426 00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.940 hudasiraj: Okay. 427 00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.050 hudasiraj: cause. Like. 428 00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:29.450 hudasiraj: yeah. Like. 429 00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:38.780 hudasiraj: as I say, that, like, it's like really hard to go to in person one especially now, because there's like already, so much traveling happening. And like 430 00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.510 hudasiraj: I won't be available f",
    "or like 431 00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:47.328 hudasiraj: the hackathons especially like, I think, okay, I can like, look at some right now. 432 00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.330 Jenny Duan: Probably either the trail or there's another one that 433 00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.830 Jenny Duan: There's another one that they're throwing. That might be a better fit for you. 434 00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.090 Jenny Duan: The boreal express. Yeah, this one looks cool. 435 00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:40.649 hudasiraj: As the dawn of the full moon rises, our journey will begin. 436 00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.469 Jenny Duan: I forgot about the the the words. 437 00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:48.929 hudasiraj: In the beginning we'll scale a great cascade. 438 00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.969 hudasiraj: You know what you know. 439 00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.319 hudasiraj: Clinging to the edges of these great mountains. 440 00:51:57.202 --> 00:52:00.819 hudasiraj: That was the sun peaks above the horizon. 441 00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:09.140 hudasiraj: casting a golden glow over the valley. What vibrant colours will you see as the light leaks across the plains. 442 00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.560 hudasiraj: distant wisdom echoed through the air. 443 00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:16.310 hudasiraj: heralding the arrival of a cross-country Odyssey. 444 00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:23.000 hudasiraj: Wonderful! It's wonderful express. 445 00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.829 Jenny Duan: Okay. July 21 to 28. 446 00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:34.829 hudasiraj: So if I were to do this, I can't do like the increasing job. And also 447 00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:42.249 hudasiraj: it's like a whole nother country. So I don't know if my parents would like my mom especially would allow to go there alone. 448 00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.950 hudasiraj: The. 449 00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.560 Jenny Duan: Fair, fair fair. That's like, very fair. 450 00:52:46.261 --> 00:52:48.969 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's tough, I think. 451 00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.370 Jenny Dua",
    "n: like. 452 00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.620 Jenny Duan: maybe do other ones then, or like, just don't do in person ones try to do something virtual. 453 00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:01.360 Jenny Duan: but I think, like one of my biggest regrets from high school is not doing hat club. 454 00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.040 Jenny Duan: So like, I really push other people to do it. 455 00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.679 Jenny Duan: but I think if it doesn't work, then it doesn't work. 456 00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:14.329 hudasiraj: Just like, I think, like, actually, Jake campus like my 1st time, like 457 00:53:14.883 --> 00:53:21.399 hudasiraj: being overnight away from my family. So I I don't have much experience like really being 458 00:53:21.786 --> 00:53:27.980 hudasiraj: to like going to like these in person type things, I mean, besides, like a few like like 459 00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.320 hudasiraj: cruise hacks, but that was like pretty close to home, so. 460 00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:36.029 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think cruise hacks like, have you done it? Did you do? Only one year or multiple years. 461 00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:37.720 hudasiraj: I did it once. 462 00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.040 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. 463 00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.989 Jenny Duan: The other ones are well past, I believe. 464 00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:47.170 hudasiraj: Oh! 465 00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:53.809 Jenny Duan: Don't think they have any online. 466 00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.270 hudasiraj: I think 467 00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.240 hudasiraj: they all pass. 468 00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:03.479 Jenny Duan: But they probably haven't ex released their new season yet. That's why. 469 00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.685 hudasiraj: I think there's also dev hacks which has, like 470 00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:08.950 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah. 471 00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:10.799 hudasiraj: Not the past step posts 472 00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.150 hudasiraj: sounds like a whole lot.

I feel like they're always sending out like a bunch of different hackathons have you heard of, or have you done any of those, or not necessarily hackathons? But, like other coding resources or coding opportunities? Have you heard of any of those. 480 00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.949 hudasiraj: I actually don't get any emails from coda classy about that. 481 00:54:55.730 --> 00:55:00.764 Jenny Duan: Really you should well, I guess maybe after next week you'll get put on the official email list. 482 00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:04.690 Jenny Duan: But I'll let you know if anything like relevant comes up. 483 00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:05.559 hudasiraj: Isn't it? 484 00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:06.850 hudasiraj: Okay? 485 00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:16.339 hudasiraj: So I guess I'll just like Prep. I'll try to do these for the for awards.

You can like work together to try to reach those goals. 488 00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.536 hudasiraj: Okay.

    ":55:40.840 Jenny Duan: in doing hackathons or winning prizes at Hackathon specifically. 491 00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.330 hudasiraj: yeah, I agree. 492 00:55:44.915 --> 00:55:45.440 hudasiraj: with. 493 00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.020 Jenny Duan: So do mind when you think about that. 494 00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:51.950 hudasiraj: I don't think in person I don't. I don't know anyone who's like really committed to. 495 00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:52.720 Jenny Duan: Online. 496 00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:58.739 hudasiraj: Yeah, online. I, probably I can like find people through discord. Like, I, I feel like. 497 00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:03.440 hudasiraj: yeah, like, I don't have many like online friends, either. But we have. 498 00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:16.480 Jenny Duan: Okay? Because I think, like, what you wanna avoid is you being the one carrying the entire team the whole time, or you having to do it by yourself. So just finding, like a couple of people to help, you would be, I think, a powerful thing. And then 499 00:56:17.085 --> 00:56:21.634 Jenny Duan: so we talked about like the the extracurriculars and the 500 00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:27.869 Jenny Duan: and the awards. So going back, the awards that could be good are 501 00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:42.279 Jenny Duan: winning like a hackathon award could be like, really good for your profile. Other award the scholarships. Things could come up for regular decision, but for early action, early decision, I think 502 00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:45.720 Jenny Duan: writing contests, and I'm still looking at like. 503 00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:51.239 hudasiraj: You think like worst comes to worst, we can just use, like the Ap scholar, with distinction. 504 00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.200 Jenny Duan: Yeah, yeah. 505 00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.270 Jenny Duan: right? 506 00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.930 Jenny Duan: And I guess, like national merit 507 00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:58.970 Jenny Duan: like commended. 508 00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.060 Jenny Duan: alt",
    "hough I feel like, that's 509 00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.360 Jenny Duan: yeah. 510 00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:13.890 Jenny Duan: again. 511 00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:25.569 hudasiraj: I know there's such things as designer phones. 512 00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:29.100 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Have you heard of that? 513 00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:34.990 hudasiraj: Yeah, I think like my sisters participated in some. So I think, hold on. 514 00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.130 hudasiraj: bum. 515 00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.220 hudasiraj: I don't know. Where do I find them? Easily. But. 516 00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:01.419 hudasiraj: yeah, I don't like. I don't know if I could find any right now, but. 517 00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:06.210 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's okay. 518 00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:20.720 Jenny Duan: the E, 519 00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:36.970 Jenny Duan: okay, this is something that I think is really cool. But this will not be applicable to you until next year. 520 00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:54.960 hudasiraj: Oh, is it a research program. 521 00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah, but it's for 18 and older. 522 00:58:57.550 --> 00:58:58.460 hudasiraj: Home 523 00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:00.020 hudasiraj: that sucks. 524 00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.140 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 525 00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:03.660 Jenny Duan: let's see. 526 00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.229 Jenny Duan: do you write like creative writing at all? 527 00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:12.119 hudasiraj: Yeah, I like like poetry and storytelling. 528 00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.829 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's see. 529 00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:19.649 Jenny Duan: have you thought about submitting to young art. 530 00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:23.630 hudasiraj: Younger parts. And 531 00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.719 hudasiraj: I feel like I remember that, but I don't know what it is. 532 00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.189 Jenny Duan: I already talked about it, for, like film, too, and other things. 533 00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.539 Jenny Duan: poetry is like a catego",
    "ry, and it opens on 534 00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.850 Jenny Duan: July 11.th If you want to submit. 535 00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:39.210 hudasiraj: Oh, okay, that sounds really interesting. 536 00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:40.700 hudasiraj: Oh, had. 537 00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:43.410 hudasiraj: Yeah. 538 00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.589 Jenny Duan: And then let me see 539 00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:55.220 Jenny Duan: the national poet 540 00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:56.680 Jenny Duan: quarterly 541 00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.820 Jenny Duan: animal. 542 01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.949 Jenny Duan: This is a good one to try. 543 01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:33.360 Jenny Duan: Summer issue is due June 30.th 544 01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.490 Jenny Duan: So let's start here with awards. 545 01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:42.660 Jenny Duan: And then for extracurriculars. We want to add your hackathons and the internship. 546 01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.930 Jenny Duan: So we can do that for the extracurriculars, for now 547 01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:49.270 Jenny Duan: I actually not hackathons the internship, and then 548 01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:55.529 Jenny Duan: I think, trying to get more involved. Let's see if you have, like a science museum 549 01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.319 Jenny Duan: that could be a good one. 550 01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.660 Jenny Duan: Do you know what the Discovery center is? 551 01:01:08.346 --> 01:01:10.910 hudasiraj: Is that the one in San Francisco. 552 01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.570 Jenny Duan: No, I don't think so. 553 01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:18.019 Jenny Duan: What about Liberty Science Center? Do you know where that is? 554 01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:20.869 hudasiraj: Now let me see. 555 01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.440 Jenny Duan: Is this even near Mountain House? I need to. 556 01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:28.010 Jenny Duan: Oh, no, it's not. It's in Jersey City. 557 01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.265 hudasiraj: Oh! 558 01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.740 Jenny Duan: How far do you live from the computer Hi",
    "story Museum? 559 01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:42.019 hudasiraj: I think I think we went on there like for a field trip. I think we live like an hour away, or an hour and a half. 560 01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.809 Jenny Duan: Yeah, super far. Okay. There's no science museums near Mountain House. 561 01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:48.790 hudasiraj: Yeah. 562 01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:54.850 Jenny Duan: Okay. 563 01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.060 Jenny Duan: I think that let's see for your extra figures 564 01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:05.140 Jenny Duan: I think you could use if you needed a last resort, you could put hackathons there. But I think 565 01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:09.610 Jenny Duan: the extracurricular, the last one is something we probably still need to keep brainstorming. 566 01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:15.349 Jenny Duan: We could focus our next session on going there. But I think right now, your main pressing thing is. 567 01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.500 Jenny Duan: I think you still really need to expand the impact of especially flip 568 01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:41.672 Jenny Duan: folklift and empowering AI. So continue making progress on the hackathon for empowering AI for folklift. I saw that you recently published like a Linkedin update that someone else submitted to folklift, keep on advertising folklift, and like, keep pushing on the growth of those organizations, and then I think I will do some more research, and then, like. The next time we meet we can talk more about 569 01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:45.199 Jenny Duan: Your last extracurricular window. How does that sound. 570 01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:46.630 hudasiraj: Yeah. Sounds. Great. 571 01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.870 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool any other questions. 572 01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:59.880 hudasiraj: We actually so so say if this company that my dad has like reached out to accepts me as an intern and then 573 01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.296 hudasiraj: alongside that if I were to like freelance web development 574 01:03:04.820 --> 01:",
    "03:08.600 hudasiraj: do you think that could be like 2 separate extracurriculars. 575 01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:17.799 Jenny Duan: I think that could be 2 separate extracurriculars. I think that it just depends on where you are at that point, if you like need an extra. Another extracurricular, or, if you're like, good by that. 576 01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.300 hudasiraj: Okay, that makes sense. 577 01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:24.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool sounds good. In that case, I think. 578 01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:30.230 Jenny Duan: yeah, if I'm actually a meeting scheduled tomorrow, I think I might need to move it into late, like later in the day. But 579 01:03:30.817 --> 01:03:33.440 Jenny Duan: does tomorrow still work for you. 580 01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.849 hudasiraj: Yeah, I think also, yeah. Later in the day also works better for me. 581 01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:41.820 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Sounds good. Then talk to you. Tomorrow. 582 01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.340 hudasiraj: Yeah, see? You bye."
