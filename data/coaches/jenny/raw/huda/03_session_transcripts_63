Okay. 3 00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.679 huda: Yeah, I can hear you. 4 00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.019 Jenny Duan: Hey? How's it going. 5 00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.160 huda: It's going well, how are you? 6 00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:27.339 Jenny Duan: I'm good. I'm currently stranded in Wyoming. So I think we haven't talked for a long time. But basically I I'm out of New York. I finished my internship last Friday, so I'm supposed to be on a road trip with my friend, and we're supposed to go from South Dakota to Stanford, California, which is like where I go to school right? But unfortunately, today our car transmission broke. So we're currently stranded in Wyoming 7 00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:35.490 Jenny Duan: like the middle of nowhere, and we're going to fly from Denver to Portland, Oregon, which is like where I'm from tomorrow, because 8 00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.355 Jenny Duan: the car won't get fixed until Wednesday. So that's my current state of affairs. But we're in like the middle of nowhere in Wyoming right now. 9 00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.909 huda: That's really interesting. Wait! Why don't you just like Oh, are you just like stopping by at home or like why are you not like flying back to Stanford directly. 10 00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.979 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because we're both teaching this program at Stanford for the next 3 weeks. So we don't get how our housing until next Thursday. 11 00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.900 Jenny Duan: So we're just gonna go to my house and like, hang out in Portland for a bit and then go to Stanford next Thursday. 12 00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.780 huda: Oh, okay, that makes sense. 13 00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.649 Jenny Duan: Yeah, anyways. How are you? I was like, I want to hear all about Jay Camp. That sounds like an amazing experience. 14 00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.610 huda: Yeah, so actually, before this call, I was supposed to have an interview, for like 15 00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:51.039 huda: I was, oh, yeah, so like, you know how we have the the news here was called Mountain House matters, and so, like I pitched for an like an opinion piece, and I asked if I could write something about like the small business culture here. And then, like the guy accepted. But I wanted to get like some interviews from like people around town, and then I was actually supposed to have one like at 8 8 to 8 20. But then he kind of like ditched on me, cause he's still working, but like 16 00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.370 Jenny Duan: No. 17 00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.997 huda: Sucks. But yeah, 18 00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:12.580 huda: in terms of J. Camp like J. Camp, was honestly like one of like the coolest experience of my life. Like it was like, 1st of all, it was like my 1st time flying alone. So it's kind of like scary at first, st but then I think I was surprisingly doing well. But like just going there and like meeting the people there was 19 00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.419 huda: like really cool cause I I'm never. I'm not really used to like meeting like people that are super passionate about like 20 00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:34.980 huda: well, anything but like like, especially like journalism, like with a few student journalists, is here. It was really nice to meet like there's like people from like Princeton, New Jersey. There's people from like Palo Alto. There's people from Hawaii like it was like really nice. And I got to hear like 21 00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:59.099 huda: really interesting perspectives, and like how the journalism scene is there like, for example, like my friend from Hawaii. She talked about like there's only 2 newspapers in like her island, and that like they're really corrupt or something, and she wants to work to like make that like, not a thing anymore. And so I think that was like, really interesting. I got to hear a lot. And then actually, I don't know, if you remember, but like one of my essays about 22 00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:10.360 huda: J. Camp was about like like Pakistani and Indian tensions, and like geopolitical tensions. And I actually met like 2 Pakistani journalists. And then we had, like so many. 23 00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.040 Jenny Duan: So cool. 24 00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:38.869 huda: And one of them talked about like how his family was like religiously persecuted back at home. And it was like I got to learn so much about like, not just journalism in general, but like I think it was kind of like, answered my question that I wrote in the application which is really cool. And yeah, I think like one of the highlights from like the experience is also, I got to and like mock anchor for, like Kxan, which is like, I think, like a child company of 25 00:05:38.920 --> 00:06:01.110 huda: Nbc, but it was really cool. And yeah, people there were just like really nice, and I think so the last day was like a convention. So we got to like talk to professionals from like New York Times, from like Washington Post, like, there's like, like boots. And there's also like one for Usc, so I got to talk to like the Annenberg like, Rep. 26 00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.700 huda: yeah. 27 00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.190 Jenny Duan: That's amazing. 28 00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:23.430 huda: Yeah. And I also got their contact information. So, yeah, I think that's pretty cool. And I was also like able to talk to like the New York Times people and introduce them. Like, I cause I'm really interested in like working with like Wordle and like the data behind that. So yeah, I really got to like, introduce myself to some of the people there which is really cool. 29 00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:43.469 Jenny Duan: I feel like data. Journalism is really cool. I feel like that's like, right up your alley, too, and especially when it comes to like. I don't know if this is a thing yet, but if it's not a thing, you can make it a thing like data representation through games like you know how Wordle is like a game like if you could turn data into like a way of reporting through a gamified way like that would be really, really cool. 30 00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.140 huda: Yeah, exactly. And like, I think. 31 00:06:46.160 --> 00:07:11.700 huda: and also so, like my sister, she goes to Cal Poly so like one of her like peers. She's like studying journalism at Cal Poly. And so my sister like connected me to her because she also has a connection to like South Asian like publications and everything. So I got to talk to her, and apparently cal Poly had, like a speaker coming in from like Wordle, and like they handle like the data and like and like, kind of like 32 00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.102 huda: that end of like the world. And I was like, that's literally like my dream job cause, I'm like working with data. But I'm also working with games. And I'm also working with journalism. 33 00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:29.690 huda: And so like, she also like gave me like the contact information. So I I think, like networking has been like really great for me like these past like like this past month. 34 00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.770 huda: And besides that, I just think 35 00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:46.949 huda: I don't know. I got like in terms of like like the things that I've been doing, even like the supplemental essays that I've been writing. I keep like coming back to J. Camp because I had so many experiences there. And like, Yeah, I don't know. I just really enjoyed Jcamp. 36 00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.679 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how? How do you think J. Camp has, if at all like. 37 00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.719 Jenny Duan: inform the way that you're seeing your future right now. 38 00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:13.639 huda: Yeah, honestly, like before, I wasn't really taking like, my, actually like, my dad wanted to talk about this because I came back. And I was really like, I got really passionate about journalism, because I saw so many people like doing so many different things and like so I kind of. Now, I'm kind of leaning towards something that's more like 39 00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:30.689 huda: like journalism related and like it kind of made me realize that I don't want to fully go into technology. But but then, like again, I still want to like stick with, like the same kind of path that I've been going through with like game development and everything. But and this is like really like 40 00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:38.010 huda: ingrained that I want to go into media in some way, like, even if it's through like data, like, I think 41 00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.330 huda: it's definitely informed, like 42 00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.910 huda: that type of 43 00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.539 huda: path. I guess. 44 00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.390 Jenny Duan: Definitely. 45 00:08:46.829 --> 00:09:11.960 Jenny Duan: Well, I think this is all like really good stuff to hear and I'm super excited that you're into journalism. And like that. Jkm, has been such a transformative experience for you. I'm wondering how you're thinking about like Usc, and in terms of like what school you want to apply to like. Are you thinking? I know you alluded to Annenberg? Is this something that you are thinking more about or like? How are you approaching this in your own life. 46 00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:39.400 huda: I think I still wanna apply to like the viterbi computer science games. As like my 1st option. Just because, like one. I think I have most experience in that, and I think I don't know. I just think like that program. Still really good. But I think there's like different like options that you can select. So I think, like my second option would probably be probably be like broadcast journalism, or producing, or something like that, and. 47 00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.680 Jenny Duan: And that would be in Annenberg. Okay. 48 00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:59.010 Jenny Duan: okay, so I know that you've been thinking about your common app. You've been working with Erin on this? How are you feeling about your common app and like, is that is that something you want to go over today? Or do you want to go more into, like other specific, like scholarship, prep, or what is sort of top of mind for you right now. 49 00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.219 huda: Yeah, I think in terms of like the college essay, I think 50 00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:16.890 huda: it's going in like a pretty good direction. I've got like a solid idea. I think I've shifted away from like the gamer story. And I kind of give you a quick like overview of what I'm doing is right now. It's like an essay about like my different identities, like 51 00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:37.140 huda: comparing and contrasting like oh, like. Sometimes I feel too like Muslim to be like Indian and like and then talking about like I feel too tech to feel like like a journalist, and then and then like actually with the format that I have it. Actually, I think, let me just share my screen. I think it's like, kind of hard to explain. But 52 00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.379 huda: yeah, and also like, I'm not completely done. But 53 00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.699 huda: yeah, so it's like. 54 00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.619 huda: it's like a tutorial on how to make a neural network. 55 00:10:48.650 --> 00:11:02.429 huda: And then so 1st step is like, feed in your data. And then the 1st part is about like me going out with friends and like we're and we're thinking of, like what restaurant we should go to and then, like I mispronounce something, and then everyone kind of just like 56 00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:11.960 huda: calls me like someone calls me like a kind of Indian friend. And so this makes me start like questioning myself like, oh, I know so many languages, but do I know any of them at all? 57 00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.389 Jenny Duan: Love this. This is so cool. 58 00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.059 huda: Thank you. So then, like, I think I'm kind of like reinforcing like what? 59 00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:49.870 huda: Like what I'm saying. It's like these little like variable things. So it kind of like makes a little bit more sense. And then the second part also, I need to condense this because it's like I talk a lot, but the second part is about like me going to J camp and like feeling like kind of like a black sheep, and like not like not feeling like a journalist, I guess, cause I don't have like. I don't do the same type of journalism as they do, and like feeling like I'm too techy to be like part of this journalist group. 60 00:11:50.221 --> 00:12:14.109 huda: So then I'm confused. And then the second part, which is, add a hidden layer of neurons to process the data. Which is like me reflecting like inside myself, like, I'm thinking, like, Oh, maybe like these people like teaching me the correct pronunciation of this restaurant wasn't a bad thing. It was like a good thing, because now I can like go up to like the owner and tell him how much I loved his food, and like, now I can like 61 00:12:14.408 --> 00:12:24.859 huda: be able to express my Indian side better. And then this part. I talk about. And then, like, I also talk about like my journalists like computer science identity. And I talk about like. 62 00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:30.410 huda: oh, one time. So that day after I felt like a black sheep in journalism. I like I was like 63 00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:48.126 huda: stood up, and I didn't know what to do. So now I de stressed myself, using the New York Times Wordle, and then realizing that, like I am the wordle girl, and that like this is what I am like, I'm I'm not just a journalist. I'm not just a techie. I'm like both. I'm an interactive media producer 64 00:12:48.420 --> 00:13:04.005 huda: and that's like kind of like the result of me like reflecting that, like, maybe I don't. I don't do the same type of journalism as they do, but I'm still. I'm still a journalist in a different way. And so then, like the last part which is like, collect output results. 65 00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.090 huda: it's gonna be about like it's talking about like how 66 00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:23.711 huda: having these different identities like being Indian being Muslim. Being a journalist, being a computer, science doesn't make me like a super, unique person that like that, no one will ever be able to replicate. It means that, like I'm each of those things. So I can relate with Muslims I can relate with Indians. I can relate with 67 00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:48.009 huda: like people. Journalists I can relate with techies so like I think it just gives me like the opportunity to be more adaptable, I think is what I'm kind of going for to that like just feeling like alone, like I'm able to like, blend in with like, not blend in. That's not the right word, like adapt to like different settings, and like present myself different ways and stuff like that. 68 00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.939 Jenny Duan: That's so cool. How did you come up with this. 69 00:13:53.038 --> 00:14:13.361 huda: So like I always kind of knew I wanted to do something cause I I thought of that idea cause like I always felt like like. I'm like a mix of everything and that like I don't have like that one person who's exactly like me, like everyone has someone who's exactly like them but like. And then so I knew I wanted to do something about that. But then the formatting 70 00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:27.886 huda: I was discussing like so like. I think Erin has like hers is like also tutorial, I think. It was like how to make a language or something like that. And so I think that one was like really interesting. I'm not sure if you'll mind that, I kind of copied her. But 71 00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.009 huda: yeah, I think. 72 00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:41.319 huda: And then I wanted to kind of use like the tech influence. And so that kind of. And I realized that the neural network is kind of like me, like, I was like learning like a neural network. 73 00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.529 huda: So then, that's kinda how I came up with it. Yeah. 74 00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:49.555 Jenny Duan: That's so cool. I love it. I think this is gonna be really good. 75 00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.210 Jenny Duan: and I'm excited to see how this unfolds. Yeah. 76 00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:06.430 Jenny Duan: of course. Yeah, this is like, yeah, this is super awesome. How are you feeling about everything else? Like what is most top of mind to you as you approach like the school year. What is your 1st day of court? No, you've already started school right. 77 00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.430 huda: Yeah, it's actually. 78 00:15:07.753 --> 00:15:08.400 Jenny Duan: For you. 79 00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:17.869 huda: Started while I was at J camp, so I missed like a week, and then I had to do a lot of catching up. So it's been a bit hectic these past few weeks. But I think I'm finally catching up and like 80 00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:24.819 huda: definitely like, the workload is like a lot this year. So it's been a bit hard like even get time to like work on my essays. 81 00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:35.780 huda: But I think like what's like, really, on top of mind is like getting my like, we have like this like, instead of having a fact sheet. It's like more like a questionnaire that we have to input to like. 82 00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:56.789 huda: like, we use naviance. And then, like the teachers who are gonna write our recommendations, they have to like, see that. And then they can write our recommendations. So if we could possibly like work on that document, that'd be great. And then, yeah, I think that's like, what's top of mind right now, and also, like my dad, he wanted to check in like if, if like, my 83 00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:10.450 huda: profile is becoming like too journalist E, or if it's becoming like too techy like. He wants to make sure that there's like a like a balance, and like he doesn't know cause right now he's feeling like I'm going too much into the journalist side. So, yeah. 84 00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:30.424 Jenny Duan: I would say in terms of your activities, like the majority of the activities that you work on are still computer science related. So I don't think that it's too journalism. I think if anything like that adds a cool layer, especially because you can talk about like data storytelling data journalism, and like the intersection between storytelling and computer science. 85 00:16:31.049 --> 00:16:40.910 Jenny Duan: I feel like that sets you apart because I think, like a lot of people are have like only tech profiles. But since you have such a good balance of different things like it really makes you different. 86 00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:47.449 Jenny Duan: but I don't know. How are you feeling about this? Do you feel like your profile is too heavy in one way or another? 87 00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:52.865 huda: I personally think it's like a good balance, and and also like 88 00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:01.110 huda: And also I wanted to apply to like this like pbs, like student advisory like leading board. It's like for. 89 00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.270 Jenny Duan: Amazing. 90 00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:19.140 huda: Yeah, and like, actually, like one of the people that I met at J camp is like currently one of like the hosts. So he's been like helping me like edit my essays and everything so that it matches like what they're looking for. So that's why I'm like really passionate about that. But, like my dad was thinking, I shouldn't apply to it, cause 91 00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.580 huda: if it like. 92 00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:34.340 huda: he just doesn't know how like that relates to my profile. But I was like I was gonna pitch ideas about like AI ethics, because, like it's for it's directed towards the youth, and a lot of the youth don't know about AI ethics and like, what can we do to like. 93 00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.660 huda: I guess, regulate AI and like, use it ethically and like 94 00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:47.539 huda: like, promote better use of AI, so that's what I was gonna pitch. But like, yeah, I I think my dad's still like a bit unsure about that opportunity. 95 00:17:48.750 --> 00:18:05.000 Jenny Duan: I would say there's never harm in applying for any opportunity. So I feel like you should definitely apply and like I mean, if you get it, and you decide you don't want to do it later on, for any reason like you don't have to do it. But I think there's really 0 harm in like submitting an application and putting yourself out there. 96 00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:16.640 Jenny Duan: I also think that like, I don't think you should be worried about like the journalism taking away from your Cs aspect. I think it like it strengthens, like, you know, all parts of your application. 97 00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.629 Jenny Duan: yeah, what does that do? 98 00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.750 huda: Sorry. What? 99 00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.339 Jenny Duan: What does that do? 100 00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.810 Jenny Duan: What does that unlike Pvs application? Do. 101 00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.610 huda: Oh, sorry it's due in September, like 26, th I think. 102 00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:45.879 Jenny Duan: Okay, then you still have plenty of time. Okay, I mean, this is something I wanted to show you from Usc that I think you might find cool 103 00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:53.329 Jenny Duan: check out this. This is a master's program. This is not an undergrad program. But I just want you to like, look at this program. 104 00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.130 huda: Oh, that's really. I feel like that's 105 00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.209 huda: exactly what I'm doing. 106 00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:06.539 Jenny Duan: It's a joint program between Usc. Annenberg and Usc. Viterbi School of Engineering. It's like a joint program. 107 00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:18.739 Jenny Duan: isn't that cool? Like I feel like. Look at this offer jointly by Usc. Annenberg and the Usc. Viterbi School of Engineering. The program bleds, advanced courses in media marketing and the human and social aspects of community 108 00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:27.989 Jenny Duan: of communication with foundational computer programming courses and advanced courses on data, science, machine learning, data, visualization, human computer interaction data, stewardship and AI ethics. 109 00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.856 huda: That's like, like, generally perfect. 110 00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.589 Jenny Duan: That is so cool, right? But this is a master's program. So 111 00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.330 Jenny Duan: this 112 00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.384 Jenny Duan: is not available for undergrads yet. But 113 00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.350 Jenny Duan: I think like. 114 00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.740 Jenny Duan: because programs there's already a precedent for this. 115 00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.539 Jenny Duan: There's already a precedent for this at Usc. Which means that, like. 116 00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.660 Jenny Duan: you know, they they care about this to some extent, you know. 117 00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.520 Jenny Duan: and I feel like 118 00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.960 Jenny Duan: like that's 119 00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.190 Jenny Duan: that means it's like a good fit. 120 00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.620 huda: Yeah, interested in doing this after undergrad. 121 00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.839 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. And so like, there's programs like this that exist. 122 00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.040 Jenny Duan: And so 123 00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.589 Jenny Duan: I mean, there's also classes like this within Us 124 00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.460 Jenny Duan: Usc, Annenberg, like 125 00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:24.309 Jenny Duan: introduction to investigative and data journalism, which is really cool. 126 00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.370 Jenny Duan: yeah. 127 00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.480 Jenny Duan: like, there are paths for you, you know. So I I wouldn't be too worried about 128 00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.909 Jenny Duan: and like your your fit, your school or your choices don't fit in because I feel like 129 00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.030 Jenny Duan: they do, and you shouldn't be worried. 130 00:20:43.710 --> 00:21:04.859 huda: Okay, this looks really cool. I think if I do end up going to Annenberg, that would be. And I and I believe, like when we toured like the the lady like our guide tour, she said. That like you can take classes from like any different school as well. So I think, like, if I'm if I even if I do end up going to computer science games, I would definitely take this class if 131 00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:05.770 huda: yeah. 132 00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 133 00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.210 Jenny Duan: And so even if you look at like the Usc 134 00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:21.870 Jenny Duan: games, computer science games, if you look at their degree requirements and they look at their classes and see what classes they have. 135 00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.269 Jenny Duan: yeah, like, you probably count it as an elective, too. And like. 136 00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.390 Jenny Duan: I feel like regardless like it's gonna be 137 00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:42.759 Jenny Duan: you're gonna have opportunities to explore this intersection. So I wouldn't really be worried about applying to this program. And I think, like 138 00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:49.070 Jenny Duan: this Pbs program will be a good fit for you. When do they release decisions? For that? Is it like before or after your application? 139 00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:51.629 huda: Let me check. 140 00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.850 Jenny Duan: Okay. 141 00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:31.300 huda: I'm actually not sure. I think 142 00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.110 Jenny Duan: Okay, no problem. 143 00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:55.280 Jenny Duan: okay. Maybe we can talk about the form that you need to fill out for school. Can you share that with me? Or do you want to share your screen? Or 144 00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.780 Jenny Duan: how do you want to go about this. 145 00:22:58.381 --> 00:23:00.090 huda: Let me just quickly find. 146 00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.170 Jenny Duan: Okay? No. Problem. 147 00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.040 huda: Okay. I shared it. And then I'm just gonna put the link as well. 148 00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.690 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 149 00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.570 huda: I already kind of like. 150 00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.470 huda: wrote some. 151 00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:33.449 huda: I think these are like ones that I did like like last year, so I don't really know if it's still accurate, but. 152 00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.729 Jenny Duan: Let me take a look. 153 00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.010 Jenny Duan: When is this due. 154 00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:54.030 huda: Well, this doesn't have a due date. But like it's just like before, when I start sending like asking for recommendations, I'm gonna need this. 155 00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.450 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Okay? 156 00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:14.549 Jenny Duan: Okay? I think for academic interests. Let's talk about also games and computer science. 157 00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.010 huda: Sorry. 158 00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.820 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say like something like I am fascinated by, and then 159 00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.860 Jenny Duan: I'll let your curiosity here, like in terms of economic interest again, right about 160 00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.260 Jenny Duan: our games like. 161 00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.220 Jenny Duan: what do you find compelling about games? Or what do you find compelling about computer science? 162 00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:53.279 huda: Like, I think, the fact that 163 00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.400 huda: computer science, like just feels like such a 164 00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:06.879 huda: like foreign thing. But like it can be used for, like different things, like teaching people, and like telling stories that there's so much you can do with it, I think. 165 00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.520 huda: fascinated by like 166 00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:17.689 huda: like the art of like telling stories and teaching 167 00:25:18.331 --> 00:25:22.609 huda: and yeah, teaching through different mediums like 168 00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:27.960 huda: video games and other computer science projects. I guess. 169 00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, can you summarize that in 2 to 3 sentences. 170 00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.500 huda: yeah. So 171 00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.850 huda: I think, like. 172 00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:50.479 huda: I'm mainly fascinated by how technology can play a role in educating and telling stories, even though it's viewed as such. A 173 00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.289 huda: I don't know how to word this like 174 00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.030 huda: it's viewed as such a 175 00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.230 huda: like. 176 00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.689 huda: I don't know the word it's such like a boring subject. But like you could do. 177 00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.000 huda: I can't say boring, because then, like, it's like interesting to me. But 178 00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.410 huda: on 179 00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:19.569 huda: yeah, I guess like the role that technology can play in education and storytelling. 180 00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.300 huda: and how 181 00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.079 huda: I think, like does is that like 182 00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.579 huda: don't need to elaborate on that, because I feel like. 183 00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.580 huda: and 184 00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:35.780 huda: I could see like. 185 00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.660 Jenny Duan: Maybe 186 00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.670 Jenny Duan: developing games, websites and 187 00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.790 huda: Yeah, like data projects. 188 00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.810 Jenny Duan: I've discovered how expansive 189 00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.959 Jenny Duan: computer science and the 190 00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.390 Jenny Duan: in. 191 00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.229 Jenny Duan: I think the way we 192 00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.780 Jenny Duan: communicate and 193 00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.120 Jenny Duan: interact with others in the world. 194 00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.190 Jenny Duan: How did media arts change your perspective on filmmaking and journalism. 195 00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:51.429 huda: So I think, like, since I worked on the student news, I got really got to like Bill, help build like the school culture. And like voice student opinions on like the news. And so it like showed me how like like the power of like using like 196 00:27:51.480 --> 00:28:00.750 huda: how I said earlier, like using technology. But this time, like using video to like inform people about like different perspectives. I think. 197 00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.629 Jenny Duan: I hope to blend these 2 passions. 198 00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.209 Jenny Duan: the technology and media into 199 00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.240 Jenny Duan: by pursuing a career in 200 00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.980 Jenny Duan: pursuit pursuit 201 00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.640 Jenny Duan: in my 202 00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.610 Jenny Duan: future academic journey. 203 00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.340 Jenny Duan: How's this. 204 00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.839 huda: That sounds great. I think. Yeah. 205 00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.280 huda: with, does this. 206 00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.129 Jenny Duan: Can it make it more specific? If you, if you think. 207 00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:43.529 huda: I was wondering if this, like academic interest like, does it require like what class you took, or something, or 208 00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.990 huda: Does that. 209 00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.150 Jenny Duan: Necessarily. 210 00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.590 huda: Okay. 211 00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.310 Jenny Duan: in college. 212 00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:57.519 Jenny Duan: I plan to pursue a major in computer science 213 00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.050 Jenny Duan: specifically focus on team development 214 00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:07.220 Jenny Duan: with potential minors or double majors 215 00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.730 Jenny Duan: in journalism or communications. How's that. 216 00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:21.900 huda: Yeah, I think I think, like my teachers might be drawn away if it says computer science, because you get a lot of students that ask for recommendations for computer science. So maybe we could like start off with like a 217 00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.200 huda: like 218 00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:28.050 huda: with a separate like Major, maybe I don't know. That's possible. 219 00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:39.789 Jenny Duan: If you want to major in computer science, then you don't want them to write that you don't want to major in computer science then. But you don't want them to write that you're planning to major in journalism. If your 1st choice, Major, and all your essays are about computer science. 220 00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.070 huda: Yeah, I can see. 221 00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.680 Jenny Duan: Really good. 222 00:29:42.531 --> 00:29:47.360 huda: I think, like interactive media. For like most of them, are like interactive media. So 223 00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.030 huda: I think, like only. 224 00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:49.400 Jenny Duan: I mean. 225 00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.489 huda: I'm I'm more like data and computer science, heavy. 226 00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.250 Jenny Duan: Okay. 227 00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:54.690 Jenny Duan: hey, Clinton 228 00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.400 Jenny Duan: major in interactive media. 229 00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.520 Jenny Duan: How's that. 230 00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.510 huda: Yeah. 231 00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.509 Jenny Duan: With potential 232 00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.009 Jenny Duan: double majors, slash minors. Should I should I add another note for that? Or do you think this is sufficient. 233 00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:20.259 huda: I think, wouldn't it be like, I think I could maybe be like, I plan to major in interactive media. A perfect blend of computer science and journalism. 234 00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.200 Jenny Duan: How's this? 235 00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.720 huda: Yeah. 236 00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 237 00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.279 Jenny Duan: Do you want to look over this response and see how you feel about it? 238 00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:51.630 huda: Wait. I think I can like talk about how how like I worked on the students because I think a lot of the teachers, like 239 00:30:51.880 --> 00:31:00.879 huda: one know me from that, and also like they might be able to like, put a put an action on it, and then also that kind of ties in with like academic interest. Maybe. 240 00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.210 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's perfect. You should definitely add a line about that. 241 00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.330 huda: My own. 242 00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:58.269 huda: Does it make grammatical sense? I'm not sure I feel like I might have messed it up. 243 00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.140 Jenny Duan: Let me check. 244 00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.259 huda: Oh, how about like, maybe I can move this move, this. 245 00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.280 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like, that's too long. 246 00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.450 huda: Was media arts 247 00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.470 huda: where I 248 00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.190 huda: worked on the student news 249 00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.630 huda: which changed my perspective on filmmaking and journalism 250 00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:37.109 huda: from not only a space for news, but a shaper in current culture. 251 00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.750 huda: school culture or 252 00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.589 huda: no, I think, yeah, that sounds good. 253 00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:51.890 huda: Yeah. 254 00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.219 huda: okay, this looks a bit. 255 00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.970 Jenny Duan: Can I make this into 2 sentences? Because I feel like it's a little long. Is that okay? 256 00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:01.950 huda: Yeah. 257 00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.520 Jenny Duan: Christmas. 258 00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.949 huda: Yeah, yeah. 259 00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.560 Jenny Duan: Cool. 260 00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.920 huda: Okay, these responses are pretty bad. 261 00:33:24.952 --> 00:33:26.879 Jenny Duan: It's okay, we can. 262 00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:32.270 Jenny Duan: It can change. I mean, this shows like how how much you've grown as a writer. Don't you think 263 00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.889 Jenny Duan: I feel like you've grown a lot as a writer. 264 00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:39.960 Jenny Duan: and. 265 00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.228 huda: Like how I wrote this and even submitted it. 266 00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.110 huda: Okay, 267 00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.230 huda: I think maybe I can talk about like. 268 00:33:50.550 --> 00:34:05.679 huda: So I mean, I'm mainly like, wait. I think I could make like different copies for my different teachers. But like this one if cause like for the my language teacher, which I like my Ap language teacher, which I think she writes like the best recommendations, and she's really selective with hers. 269 00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:14.059 huda: And also genuinely, she did like change my perspective on journalism. So I think I could maybe like write about how this like 270 00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.639 huda: this class, combined with media arts like 271 00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:23.380 huda: I kind of stemmed like, how I wanna in like infuse journalism 272 00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:24.400 huda: with 273 00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:35.490 huda: computer science cause like, I've always been like like a tech nerd, I guess, since I was younger, and so like this gave me like a new perspective, that these 2 things could be combined. 274 00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.199 Jenny Duan: think 275 00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:51.990 Jenny Duan: are you are, if you, if you like, write different versions. Are your teachers able to see the different versions or. 276 00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.210 huda: We actually. 277 00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.810 Jenny Duan: Like. 278 00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:55.949 huda: We are just one 279 00:34:56.329 --> 00:35:05.469 huda: cause I know like, and I know they have to like. Put it through naviance. So like I'm not sure, if, like, we put these answers into naviance 280 00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:07.829 huda: actually don't know the process too well, but 281 00:35:11.499 --> 00:35:15.679 huda: actually like, I think it's safer to like not specialize it to someone. 282 00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would recommend, probably not because I don't. 283 00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.770 Jenny Duan: If I can remember correctly. I don't think that now. The answer will distinguish. 284 00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.530 huda: Okay. 285 00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:34.980 huda: then, yeah, maybe like, I can talk about like how I've been like 286 00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:39.250 huda: a gamer since I was really young or like. And then 287 00:35:39.893 --> 00:35:49.370 huda: I've also been like tech nerd since I was young, and also really enjoyed like writing and reading books when I was young. So like all these things have like evolved in different ways and like 288 00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:54.200 huda: at the end of the day, kind of came together to like develop my passion. 289 00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:02.160 huda: I think. Yeah, I don't know how to like word it without like boring the teacher. So like. 290 00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.960 huda: okay. 291 00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:52.590 huda: wait. I don't know if I'm like overloading like all these things. But if I say that I I like games. I like reading and writing. I like tech is, do you think it's like too much, and like 292 00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.610 huda: they might see through that. 293 00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.099 Jenny Duan: Maybe if you separate it by 294 00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.585 Jenny Duan: by 295 00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.319 Jenny Duan: subject, and then 296 00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:08.230 Jenny Duan: and then like, just write 2 sentences each. What do you think. 297 00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.310 huda: At an advantage. Yeah. 298 00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.740 Jenny Duan: And I'm missing. I think, like game development, computer science and journalism are like 299 00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:20.240 Jenny Duan: 3 biggest things for you. Is there anything else that you feel like you wanted to highlight about yourself. 300 00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:28.169 huda: I mean, I don't think it's really relevant. But like I also really enjoy history. But I don't think that's really relevant. 301 00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:32.670 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't think you're gonna be applying for history program. So I feel like, that's 302 00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.630 Jenny Duan: not important. 303 00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:35.460 huda: Yeah. 304 00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:43.180 Jenny Duan: I also think, like at Stanford, Science Technology and society was a good program for you. 305 00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.290 huda: Yeah, actually. 306 00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.269 Jenny Duan: About this. 307 00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:58.010 huda: Decided on sts, and then and then I actually did a little more research into it. And I saw, like the concentrations. And I, there's like one specific, which is a concentration communication and media, and like. 308 00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.570 Jenny Duan: I. 309 00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:04.199 huda: That's a really great fit cause. It's also like talking about, like how technology and media interact. 310 00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect. 311 00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.740 huda: So also like, should I write about like 312 00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:17.504 huda: me like doing these thing actions as a kid like 313 00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.639 huda: I don't know if that's like 314 00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:24.180 huda: they share ads. Anything to like like what they could write about me. 315 00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.839 huda: Would I like? Include, like my classes that I've taken that like? 316 00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:46.115 huda: No, I think I think, like, okay for computer science. I know I can definitely like, talk about like attending hackathons in middle school, and like, how like bolstered my love for like 317 00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.100 huda: technology, I guess 318 00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.670 huda: on. 319 00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.997 huda: And I don't think I should mention like how both of my parents do tech. But 320 00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.339 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe I think, just do what you think. 321 00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.470 huda: Yeah. 322 00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:02.750 Jenny Duan: Fast. Yeah. 323 00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.340 huda: Do you think this is fine for computer science? 324 00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.870 huda: Maybe I could see like further. 325 00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:55.519 Jenny Duan: I think you should elaborate what this means. What does this coding competitions online mean? 326 00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:59.179 Jenny Duan: I think like people wouldn't understand if they didn't have the Cs background 327 00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:06.390 Jenny Duan: like, I feel like, how did you get inspired to do this like, how did you start doing this? 328 00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.040 Jenny Duan: I think all of that is important. 329 00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:14.708 huda: But I don't really have an interesting story. It's just that like my dad told me to. 330 00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:16.410 Jenny Duan: No 331 00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.450 huda: Maybe like. 332 00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:37.409 huda: I don't know if this is like, too like, yeah, like, I don't know if it would like relate or anything but that one essay I wrote about like the 1st experience that I had with computer sciences like coding like a robot on telling and telling it what to do. 333 00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.470 huda: but 334 00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.220 huda: I don't know if that's like 335 00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.820 huda: like, I feel like teachers don't really care about that. But I don't know. 336 00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.290 huda: Maybe I could be like I used to. 337 00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.830 Jenny Duan: Can. You can say 338 00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.130 Jenny Duan: you could take, and maybe we're the only girl, or like you were like the only 339 00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.400 Jenny Duan: something to like. Make your experience a little bit different. 340 00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.330 Jenny Duan: If that is true. If that's not true, then that's fine. 341 00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:14.139 huda: Yeah, I think I definitely competed in a lot of like male heavy hackathons. So. 342 00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:14.860 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 343 00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.860 huda: is this. 344 00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.870 huda: I don't know if this is generic 345 00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:41.810 huda: after 346 00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.869 huda: watching a couple 347 00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.440 huda: okay does this response look good. 348 00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.140 Jenny Duan: how did you grow into your these skills? 349 00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:31.399 huda: I guess, by like taking classes at school, and like 350 00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:33.690 huda: like making more projects. 351 00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:35.700 Jenny Duan: Right. 352 00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.299 Jenny Duan: How like, however, through what 353 00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.610 Jenny Duan: I would say, dot dot. 354 00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.199 huda: Oh, I think 355 00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:52.109 huda: over here, I see, like by learning new methods of technology, like artificial intelligence and building websites. 356 00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.709 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would rearrange that sentence order. 357 00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, this looks good. 358 00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.500 Jenny Duan: Okay? And let's finish the game development one. 359 00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:58.240 Jenny Duan: And then since then, maybe you can say, since then I've learned to build my own 360 00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:04.269 Jenny Duan: like crafting new worlds via I don't know, and bridging my passion for ethics with 361 00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.459 Jenny Duan: something something through Centoria. 362 00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:22.719 huda: Yeah, I don't know if okay, wait. Correct me. If this gets like too poetic. But like. 363 00:46:23.328 --> 00:46:25.320 huda: it's been the notepad. 364 00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.210 huda: I think. Oh, my. 365 00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:42.420 huda: yeah, I'm just. 366 00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.059 huda: And I'm like, I think, to 367 00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:14.889 huda: emphasize like 368 00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:19.169 huda: where game development came from. I could talk about like how 369 00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.080 huda: I mean, like, I kind of talk about like how I say that 370 00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:31.929 huda: it's been like a notepad with the ink of my passion for different topics, like, yeah, ethics, education and storytelling. 371 00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.990 huda: and that's kind of like the origin. 372 00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.350 huda: And then I could say. 373 00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:55.560 huda: Should I talk about like distributing centuria to different schools? 374 00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.690 Jenny Duan: Mentioned Cynthoria at least somewhere, like just the name of your project. 375 00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.310 Jenny Duan: I think you can. You can mention distributing it to schools if you want. 376 00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:20.051 huda: Okay, does this look good? 377 00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.949 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that looks good. 378 00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.250 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is cool. But let's change the journalism. One. 379 00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:44.210 huda: No, I think. 380 00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:45.240 Jenny Duan: As little get. 381 00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:45.910 huda: Okay. 382 00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:50.130 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think I think I was like, I think we should maybe change this. 383 00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:54.395 huda: Yeah, I I really don't know what I was thinking when I wrote that. But. 384 00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.099 Jenny Duan: That's okay. That's okay. 385 00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:59.510 Jenny Duan: Oh. 386 00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:12.100 huda: Okay. And then I I can. I like, I think I can talk about like how like I read books. And I always appreciated like how they were able to turn like words into like 387 00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.766 huda: education, basically, and like how 388 00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:22.370 huda: and also like another part of like me getting into journalism was like not seeing, like 389 00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:33.699 huda: the stories that I want to be like represented like on the screen and like on newspapers and stuff. And so I think maybe that's what I can write about and like how I started off like 390 00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.559 huda: kind of being confused 391 00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:42.629 huda: well, like what I should do within journalism. And now I know that, like I want to combine all my interests. Maybe. 392 00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.069 Jenny Duan: Yeah, good idea. 393 00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.190 huda: Yeah, I'm doing this. But 394 00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:14.850 huda: does this look good? 395 00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:20.030 Jenny Duan: This looks great. 396 00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:21.700 Jenny Duan: Alright, thank you. 397 00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.399 Jenny Duan: I would add a little bit more about what you've done. For example, like going to J. Camp. 398 00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:29.030 huda: Oh, yeah, okay. 399 00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:40.600 huda: maybe. Could I? For like this part, can I mention like how I told like some people about like Mountain house, and like my like stories like of coming from this like community 400 00:54:40.975 --> 00:54:47.550 huda: cause like I don't know, especially like I mean, I think I can like obviously like name, drop mountain house, like being like 401 00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:51.899 huda: represented there. But yeah, like. 402 00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:56.159 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I maybe you can say I got to share my background. Coming from 403 00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:59.959 Jenny Duan: a rural town in California and 404 00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.939 Jenny Duan: learning to tell the stories of people from all over the world. 405 00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.200 Jenny Duan: What do you think that about that? 406 00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:33.090 Jenny Duan: Okay. 407 00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:33.880 huda: Does this? 408 00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:36.390 huda: Oh, good! Like this like last sentence. 409 00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.310 Jenny Duan: Looks, good. 410 00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:42.930 huda: Okay. 411 00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:59.030 Jenny Duan: Tell us about a high school project or assignment that was most memorable to you. Why was this memorable to you? 412 00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:06.120 huda: Okay. I changed my mind after this because we had, like this other assignment in AV Lane, called Shark Tank. 413 00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:07.580 huda: and. 414 00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.300 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, we talked about this. 415 00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.039 huda: Yeah. And I wanted to talk about like, how. 416 00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.096 huda: So at 1st we wanted to do like a project which is like, 417 00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:22.975 huda: It was like, kind of stupid. It was like canceling out like brain rot, basically with 418 00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:25.699 huda: would like subliminal messages. 419 00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:38.378 huda: And so at first, st like, we were kind of really wanted to do that idea. But then we like got scared because there was like like the psychology teacher was saying that like, Oh, this is kind of like proven false like it wouldn't work and like 420 00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:54.051 huda: like it kind of taught me that. And then, like we kind of shifted away from it. But I still kind of wish we went with that option because it taught us that like making big risks was taking big risks, would have like led to like 421 00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.500 huda: like better results, I guess, and like 422 00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:03.040 huda: I don't know. I think it taught me like risk taking factor, and that I should continue doing that in life. 423 00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:17.640 Jenny Duan: I think that's a good idea. I think risk taking is something that's like super undervalued and like demonstrates a lot about your personal character. I feel like the shark tank example is a really good one. 424 00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.399 Jenny Duan: Also, you can talk about like. 425 00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:25.010 Jenny Duan: you know, like 426 00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:29.100 Jenny Duan: collaborating with other people and having to like work together, to solve problems. 427 00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.139 huda: Oh, yeah. 428 01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.550 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is looking good. 429 01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.279 Jenny Duan: What were the impacts of this. 430 01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:20.800 huda: look up the project. 431 01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Did it work out. 432 01:01:24.311 --> 01:01:35.019 huda: Okay, so honestly like it went. So like, we kind of just did go for like the safer option. But like we like kind of like it was kind of like a mix like we pivoted to like. 433 01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:43.870 huda: We kept the same idea that we wanted to cancel out like rain or something, but like in like a different way. So we did like a project where 434 01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:56.609 huda: we like showed like educational games and stuff, and like provided like screen time, based off of like, how much you learn. And then like, that's kind of like what our product was like. But it was like 435 01:01:57.464 --> 01:02:02.200 huda: a bit different from like the original idea, but like improvising, I think. 436 01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.360 Jenny Duan: What's this? 437 01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.049 huda: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. 438 01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think we should finish all of this, the rest 439 01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.029 Jenny Duan: in another section. What do you think. 440 01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:49.539 huda: Yeah, I agree. 441 01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:56.059 Jenny Duan: Well, what would be a good time to meet for you? Tomorrow I'm pretty free, or like anytime this weekend 442 01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:57.889 Jenny Duan: we can discuss. 443 01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:04.039 huda: I think I should be available this like Saturday, like almost any time. 444 01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:08.320 huda: Yeah, whatever works best for you. 445 01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:15.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do. Saturday. 446 01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.180 Jenny Duan: potentially. Saturday 447 01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.280 Jenny Duan: evening around 448 01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:24.929 Jenny Duan: 9 pm. Pacific time. Would that be okay? 449 01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.000 huda: Yeah, that's fine. 450 01:03:28.607 --> 01:03:32.480 Jenny Duan: Is that too late? Also too late in the morning? 451 01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.609 Jenny Duan: Okay, Fraysha. 452 01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.790 huda: Yeah, yeah. 453 01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:37.429 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 454 01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.769 Jenny Duan: I'll reach out to Mary to have that scheduled. Then. 455 01:03:41.998 --> 01:03:45.350 Jenny Duan: Okay, then talk to you. Then alright. 456 01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:46.609 Jenny Duan: bye, bye.",

Okay. 3 00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.679 huda: Yeah, I can hear you. 4 00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.019 Jenny Duan: Hey? How's it going. 5 00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.160 huda: It's going well, how are you? 6 00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:27.339 Jenny Duan: I'm good. I'm currently stranded in Wyoming. So I think we haven't talked for a long time. But basically I I'm out of New York. I finished my internship last Friday, so I'm supposed to be on a road trip with my friend, and we're supposed to go from South Dakota to Stanford, California, which is like where I go to school right? But unfortunately, today our car transmission broke. So we're currently stranded in Wyoming 7 00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:35.490 Jenny Duan: like the middle of nowhere, and we're going to fly from Denver to Portland, Oregon, which is like where I'm from tomorrow, because 8 00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.355 Jenny Duan: the car won't get fixed until Wednesday. So that's my current state of affairs. But we're in like the middle of nowhere in Wyoming right now. 9 00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.909 huda: That's really interesting. Wait! Why don't you just like Oh, are you just like stopping by at home or like why are you not like flying back to Stanford directly. 10 00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.979 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because we're both teaching this program at Stanford for the next 3 weeks. So we don't get how our housing until next Thursday. 11 00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.900 Jenny Duan: So we're just gonna go to my house and like, hang out in Portland for a bit and then go to Stanford next Thursday. 12 00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.780 huda: Oh, okay, that makes sense. 13 00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.649 Jenny Duan: Yeah, anyways. How are you? I was like, I want to hear all about Jay Camp. That sounds like an amazing experience. 14 00:03:17.",
    "850 --> 00:03:22.610 huda: Yeah, so actually, before this call, I was supposed to have an interview, for like 15 00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:51.039 huda: I was, oh, yeah, so like, you know how we have the the news here was called Mountain House matters, and so, like I pitched for an like an opinion piece, and I asked if I could write something about like the small business culture here. And then, like the guy accepted. But I wanted to get like some interviews from like people around town, and then I was actually supposed to have one like at 8 8 to 8 20. But then he kind of like ditched on me, cause he's still working, but like 16 00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.370 Jenny Duan: No. 17 00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.997 huda: Sucks. But yeah, 18 00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:12.580 huda: in terms of J. Camp like J. Camp, was honestly like one of like the coolest experience of my life. Like it was like, 1st of all, it was like my 1st time flying alone. So it's kind of like scary at first, st but then I think I was surprisingly doing well. But like just going there and like meeting the people there was 19 00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.419 huda: like really cool cause I I'm never. I'm not really used to like meeting like people that are super passionate about like 20 00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:34.980 huda: well, anything but like like, especially like journalism, like with a few student journalists, is here. It was really nice to meet like there's like people from like Princeton, New Jersey. There's people from like Palo Alto. There's people from Hawaii like it was like really nice. And I got to hear like 21 00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:59.099 huda: really interesting perspectives, and like how the journalism scene is there like, for example, like my friend from Hawaii. She talked about like there's only 2 newspapers in like her island, and that like they're really corrupt or something, and she wants to work to like make that like, not a thing anymore. And so I think that was like, really interesting. I got",
    " to hear a lot. And then actually, I don't know, if you remember, but like one of my essays about 22 00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:10.360 huda: J. Camp was about like like Pakistani and Indian tensions, and like geopolitical tensions. And I actually met like 2 Pakistani journalists. And then we had, like so many. 23 00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.040 Jenny Duan: So cool. 24 00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:38.869 huda: And one of them talked about like how his family was like religiously persecuted back at home. And it was like I got to learn so much about like, not just journalism in general, but like I think it was kind of like, answered my question that I wrote in the application which is really cool. And yeah, I think like one of the highlights from like the experience is also, I got to and like mock anchor for, like Kxan, which is like, I think, like a child company of 25 00:05:38.920 --> 00:06:01.110 huda: Nbc, but it was really cool. And yeah, people there were just like really nice, and I think so the last day was like a convention. So we got to like talk to professionals from like New York Times, from like Washington Post, like, there's like, like boots. And there's also like one for Usc, so I got to talk to like the Annenberg like, Rep. 26 00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.700 huda: yeah. 27 00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.190 Jenny Duan: That's amazing. 28 00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:23.430 huda: Yeah. And I also got their contact information. So, yeah, I think that's pretty cool. And I was also like able to talk to like the New York Times people and introduce them. Like, I cause I'm really interested in like working with like Wordle and like the data behind that. So yeah, I really got to like, introduce myself to some of the people there which is really cool. 29 00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:43.469 Jenny Duan: I feel like data. Journalism is really cool. I feel like that's like, right up your alley, too, and especially when it comes to like. I don't know if this is a thing yet, but if it's not a thing",
    ", you can make it a thing like data representation through games like you know how Wordle is like a game like if you could turn data into like a way of reporting through a gamified way like that would be really, really cool. 30 00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.140 huda: Yeah, exactly. And like, I think. 31 00:06:46.160 --> 00:07:11.700 huda: and also so, like my sister, she goes to Cal Poly so like one of her like peers. She's like studying journalism at Cal Poly. And so my sister like connected me to her because she also has a connection to like South Asian like publications and everything. So I got to talk to her, and apparently cal Poly had, like a speaker coming in from like Wordle, and like they handle like the data and like and like, kind of like 32 00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.102 huda: that end of like the world. And I was like, that's literally like my dream job cause, I'm like working with data. But I'm also working with games. And I'm also working with journalism. 33 00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:29.690 huda: And so like, she also like gave me like the contact information. So I I think, like networking has been like really great for me like these past like like this past month. 34 00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.770 huda: And besides that, I just think 35 00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:46.949 huda: I don't know. I got like in terms of like like the things that I've been doing, even like the supplemental essays that I've been writing. I keep like coming back to J. Camp because I had so many experiences there. And like, Yeah, I don't know. I just really enjoyed Jcamp. 36 00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.679 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how? How do you think J. Camp has, if at all like. 37 00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.719 Jenny Duan: inform the way that you're seeing your future right now. 38 00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:13.639 huda: Yeah, honestly, like before, I wasn't really taking like, my, actually like, my dad wanted to talk about this because I came back. And I was really like, I got really passionate about ",
    "journalism, because I saw so many people like doing so many different things and like so I kind of. Now, I'm kind of leaning towards something that's more like 39 00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:30.689 huda: like journalism related and like it kind of made me realize that I don't want to fully go into technology. But but then, like again, I still want to like stick with, like the same kind of path that I've been going through with like game development and everything. But and this is like really like 40 00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:38.010 huda: ingrained that I want to go into media in some way, like, even if it's through like data, like, I think 41 00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.330 huda: it's definitely informed, like 42 00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.910 huda: that type of 43 00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.539 huda: path. I guess. 44 00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.390 Jenny Duan: Definitely. 45 00:08:46.829 --> 00:09:11.960 Jenny Duan: Well, I think this is all like really good stuff to hear and I'm super excited that you're into journalism. And like that. Jkm, has been such a transformative experience for you. I'm wondering how you're thinking about like Usc, and in terms of like what school you want to apply to like. Are you thinking? I know you alluded to Annenberg? Is this something that you are thinking more about or like? How are you approaching this in your own life. 46 00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:39.400 huda: I think I still wanna apply to like the viterbi computer science games. As like my 1st option. Just because, like one. I think I have most experience in that, and I think I don't know. I just think like that program. Still really good. But I think there's like different like options that you can select. So I think, like my second option would probably be probably be like broadcast journalism, or producing, or something like that, and. 47 00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.680 Jenny Duan: And that would be in Annenberg. Okay. 48 00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:59.010 Jenny Duan: okay, so I know that you've b",
    "een thinking about your common app. You've been working with Erin on this? How are you feeling about your common app and like, is that is that something you want to go over today? Or do you want to go more into, like other specific, like scholarship, prep, or what is sort of top of mind for you right now. 49 00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.219 huda: Yeah, I think in terms of like the college essay, I think 50 00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:16.890 huda: it's going in like a pretty good direction. I've got like a solid idea. I think I've shifted away from like the gamer story. And I kind of give you a quick like overview of what I'm doing is right now. It's like an essay about like my different identities, like 51 00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:37.140 huda: comparing and contrasting like oh, like. Sometimes I feel too like Muslim to be like Indian and like and then talking about like I feel too tech to feel like like a journalist, and then and then like actually with the format that I have it. Actually, I think, let me just share my screen. I think it's like, kind of hard to explain. But 52 00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.379 huda: yeah, and also like, I'm not completely done. But 53 00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.699 huda: yeah, so it's like. 54 00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.619 huda: it's like a tutorial on how to make a neural network. 55 00:10:48.650 --> 00:11:02.429 huda: And then so 1st step is like, feed in your data. And then the 1st part is about like me going out with friends and like we're and we're thinking of, like what restaurant we should go to and then, like I mispronounce something, and then everyone kind of just like 56 00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:11.960 huda: calls me like someone calls me like a kind of Indian friend. And so this makes me start like questioning myself like, oh, I know so many languages, but do I know any of them at all? 57 00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.389 Jenny Duan: Love this. This is so cool. 58 00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.059 huda: Thank you. So then, like, I think I'm kind ",
    "of like reinforcing like what? 59 00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:49.870 huda: Like what I'm saying. It's like these little like variable things. So it kind of like makes a little bit more sense. And then the second part also, I need to condense this because it's like I talk a lot, but the second part is about like me going to J camp and like feeling like kind of like a black sheep, and like not like not feeling like a journalist, I guess, cause I don't have like. I don't do the same type of journalism as they do, and like feeling like I'm too techy to be like part of this journalist group. 60 00:11:50.221 --> 00:12:14.109 huda: So then I'm confused. And then the second part, which is, add a hidden layer of neurons to process the data. Which is like me reflecting like inside myself, like, I'm thinking, like, Oh, maybe like these people like teaching me the correct pronunciation of this restaurant wasn't a bad thing. It was like a good thing, because now I can like go up to like the owner and tell him how much I loved his food, and like, now I can like 61 00:12:14.408 --> 00:12:24.859 huda: be able to express my Indian side better. And then this part. I talk about. And then, like, I also talk about like my journalists like computer science identity. And I talk about like. 62 00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:30.410 huda: oh, one time. So that day after I felt like a black sheep in journalism. I like I was like 63 00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:48.126 huda: stood up, and I didn't know what to do. So now I de stressed myself, using the New York Times Wordle, and then realizing that, like I am the wordle girl, and that like this is what I am like, I'm I'm not just a journalist. I'm not just a techie. I'm like both. I'm an interactive media producer 64 00:12:48.420 --> 00:13:04.005 huda: and that's like kind of like the result of me like reflecting that, like, maybe I don't. I don't do the same type of journalism as they do, but I'm still. I'm still a journalist in a different way. And so then, lik",
    "e the last part which is like, collect output results. 65 00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.090 huda: it's gonna be about like it's talking about like how 66 00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:23.711 huda: having these different identities like being Indian being Muslim. Being a journalist, being a computer, science doesn't make me like a super, unique person that like that, no one will ever be able to replicate. It means that, like I'm each of those things. So I can relate with Muslims I can relate with Indians. I can relate with 67 00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:48.009 huda: like people. Journalists I can relate with techies so like I think it just gives me like the opportunity to be more adaptable, I think is what I'm kind of going for to that like just feeling like alone, like I'm able to like, blend in with like, not blend in. That's not the right word, like adapt to like different settings, and like present myself different ways and stuff like that. 68 00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.939 Jenny Duan: That's so cool. How did you come up with this. 69 00:13:53.038 --> 00:14:13.361 huda: So like I always kind of knew I wanted to do something cause I I thought of that idea cause like I always felt like like. I'm like a mix of everything and that like I don't have like that one person who's exactly like me, like everyone has someone who's exactly like them but like. And then so I knew I wanted to do something about that. But then the formatting 70 00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:27.886 huda: I was discussing like so like. I think Erin has like hers is like also tutorial, I think. It was like how to make a language or something like that. And so I think that one was like really interesting. I'm not sure if you'll mind that, I kind of copied her. But 71 00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.009 huda: yeah, I think. 72 00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:41.319 huda: And then I wanted to kind of use like the tech influence. And so that kind of. And I realized that the neural network is kind of like me, like, I was like learning like a ",
    "neural network. 73 00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.529 huda: So then, that's kinda how I came up with it. Yeah. 74 00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:49.555 Jenny Duan: That's so cool. I love it. I think this is gonna be really good. 75 00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.210 Jenny Duan: and I'm excited to see how this unfolds. Yeah. 76 00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:06.430 Jenny Duan: of course. Yeah, this is like, yeah, this is super awesome. How are you feeling about everything else? Like what is most top of mind to you as you approach like the school year. What is your 1st day of court? No, you've already started school right. 77 00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.430 huda: Yeah, it's actually. 78 00:15:07.753 --> 00:15:08.400 Jenny Duan: For you. 79 00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:17.869 huda: Started while I was at J camp, so I missed like a week, and then I had to do a lot of catching up. So it's been a bit hectic these past few weeks. But I think I'm finally catching up and like 80 00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:24.819 huda: definitely like, the workload is like a lot this year. So it's been a bit hard like even get time to like work on my essays. 81 00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:35.780 huda: But I think like what's like, really, on top of mind is like getting my like, we have like this like, instead of having a fact sheet. It's like more like a questionnaire that we have to input to like. 82 00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:56.789 huda: like, we use naviance. And then, like the teachers who are gonna write our recommendations, they have to like, see that. And then they can write our recommendations. So if we could possibly like work on that document, that'd be great. And then, yeah, I think that's like, what's top of mind right now, and also, like my dad, he wanted to check in like if, if like, my 83 00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:10.450 huda: profile is becoming like too journalist E, or if it's becoming like too techy like. He wants to make sure that there's like a like a balance, and like he doesn't know cause right now he's feeling like I",
    "'m going too much into the journalist side. So, yeah. 84 00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:30.424 Jenny Duan: I would say in terms of your activities, like the majority of the activities that you work on are still computer science related. So I don't think that it's too journalism. I think if anything like that adds a cool layer, especially because you can talk about like data storytelling data journalism, and like the intersection between storytelling and computer science. 85 00:16:31.049 --> 00:16:40.910 Jenny Duan: I feel like that sets you apart because I think, like a lot of people are have like only tech profiles. But since you have such a good balance of different things like it really makes you different. 86 00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:47.449 Jenny Duan: but I don't know. How are you feeling about this? Do you feel like your profile is too heavy in one way or another? 87 00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:52.865 huda: I personally think it's like a good balance, and and also like 88 00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:01.110 huda: And also I wanted to apply to like this like pbs, like student advisory like leading board. It's like for. 89 00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.270 Jenny Duan: Amazing. 90 00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:19.140 huda: Yeah, and like, actually, like one of the people that I met at J camp is like currently one of like the hosts. So he's been like helping me like edit my essays and everything so that it matches like what they're looking for. So that's why I'm like really passionate about that. But, like my dad was thinking, I shouldn't apply to it, cause 91 00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.580 huda: if it like. 92 00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:34.340 huda: he just doesn't know how like that relates to my profile. But I was like I was gonna pitch ideas about like AI ethics, because, like it's for it's directed towards the youth, and a lot of the youth don't know about AI ethics and like, what can we do to like. 93 00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.660 huda: I guess, regulate AI and like, use it ethically and like 9",
    "4 00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:47.539 huda: like, promote better use of AI, so that's what I was gonna pitch. But like, yeah, I I think my dad's still like a bit unsure about that opportunity. 95 00:17:48.750 --> 00:18:05.000 Jenny Duan: I would say there's never harm in applying for any opportunity. So I feel like you should definitely apply and like I mean, if you get it, and you decide you don't want to do it later on, for any reason like you don't have to do it. But I think there's really 0 harm in like submitting an application and putting yourself out there. 96 00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:16.640 Jenny Duan: I also think that like, I don't think you should be worried about like the journalism taking away from your Cs aspect. I think it like it strengthens, like, you know, all parts of your application. 97 00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.629 Jenny Duan: yeah, what does that do? 98 00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.750 huda: Sorry. What? 99 00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.339 Jenny Duan: What does that do? 100 00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.810 Jenny Duan: What does that unlike Pvs application? Do. 101 00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.610 huda: Oh, sorry it's due in September, like 26, th I think. 102 00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:45.879 Jenny Duan: Okay, then you still have plenty of time. Okay, I mean, this is something I wanted to show you from Usc that I think you might find cool 103 00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:53.329 Jenny Duan: check out this. This is a master's program. This is not an undergrad program. But I just want you to like, look at this program. 104 00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.130 huda: Oh, that's really. I feel like that's 105 00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.209 huda: exactly what I'm doing. 106 00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:06.539 Jenny Duan: It's a joint program between Usc. Annenberg and Usc. Viterbi School of Engineering. It's like a joint program. 107 00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:18.739 Jenny Duan: isn't that cool? Like I feel like. Look at this offer jointly by Usc. Annenberg and the Usc. Viterbi School of Engineeri",
    "ng. The program bleds, advanced courses in media marketing and the human and social aspects of community 108 00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:27.989 Jenny Duan: of communication with foundational computer programming courses and advanced courses on data, science, machine learning, data, visualization, human computer interaction data, stewardship and AI ethics. 109 00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.856 huda: That's like, like, generally perfect. 110 00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.589 Jenny Duan: That is so cool, right? But this is a master's program. So 111 00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.330 Jenny Duan: this 112 00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.384 Jenny Duan: is not available for undergrads yet. But 113 00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.350 Jenny Duan: I think like. 114 00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.740 Jenny Duan: because programs there's already a precedent for this. 115 00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.539 Jenny Duan: There's already a precedent for this at Usc. Which means that, like. 116 00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.660 Jenny Duan: you know, they they care about this to some extent, you know. 117 00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.520 Jenny Duan: and I feel like 118 00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.960 Jenny Duan: like that's 119 00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.190 Jenny Duan: that means it's like a good fit. 120 00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.620 huda: Yeah, interested in doing this after undergrad. 121 00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.839 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. And so like, there's programs like this that exist. 122 00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.040 Jenny Duan: And so 123 00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.589 Jenny Duan: I mean, there's also classes like this within Us 124 00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.460 Jenny Duan: Usc, Annenberg, like 125 00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:24.309 Jenny Duan: introduction to investigative and data journalism, which is really cool. 126 00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.370 Jenny Duan: yeah. 127 00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.480 Jenny Duan: like, there are paths for you, you know. So I I wouldn't be too worried about 128 00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.90",
    "9 Jenny Duan: and like your your fit, your school or your choices don't fit in because I feel like 129 00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.030 Jenny Duan: they do, and you shouldn't be worried. 130 00:20:43.710 --> 00:21:04.859 huda: Okay, this looks really cool. I think if I do end up going to Annenberg, that would be. And I and I believe, like when we toured like the the lady like our guide tour, she said. That like you can take classes from like any different school as well. So I think, like, if I'm if I even if I do end up going to computer science games, I would definitely take this class if 131 00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:05.770 huda: yeah. 132 00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 133 00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.210 Jenny Duan: And so even if you look at like the Usc 134 00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:21.870 Jenny Duan: games, computer science games, if you look at their degree requirements and they look at their classes and see what classes they have. 135 00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.269 Jenny Duan: yeah, like, you probably count it as an elective, too. And like. 136 00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.390 Jenny Duan: I feel like regardless like it's gonna be 137 00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:42.759 Jenny Duan: you're gonna have opportunities to explore this intersection. So I wouldn't really be worried about applying to this program. And I think, like 138 00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:49.070 Jenny Duan: this Pbs program will be a good fit for you. When do they release decisions? For that? Is it like before or after your application? 139 00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:51.629 huda: Let me check. 140 00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.850 Jenny Duan: Okay. 141 00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:31.300 huda: I'm actually not sure. I think 142 00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.110 Jenny Duan: Okay, no problem. 143 00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:55.280 Jenny Duan: okay. Maybe we can talk about the form that you need to fill out for school. Can you share that with me? Or do you want to share your screen? Or 144 00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.780",
    " Jenny Duan: how do you want to go about this. 145 00:22:58.381 --> 00:23:00.090 huda: Let me just quickly find. 146 00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.170 Jenny Duan: Okay? No. Problem. 147 00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.040 huda: Okay. I shared it. And then I'm just gonna put the link as well. 148 00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.690 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 149 00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.570 huda: I already kind of like. 150 00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.470 huda: wrote some. 151 00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:33.449 huda: I think these are like ones that I did like like last year, so I don't really know if it's still accurate, but. 152 00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.729 Jenny Duan: Let me take a look. 153 00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.010 Jenny Duan: When is this due. 154 00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:54.030 huda: Well, this doesn't have a due date. But like it's just like before, when I start sending like asking for recommendations, I'm gonna need this. 155 00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.450 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Okay? 156 00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:14.549 Jenny Duan: Okay? I think for academic interests. Let's talk about also games and computer science. 157 00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.010 huda: Sorry. 158 00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.820 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say like something like I am fascinated by, and then 159 00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.860 Jenny Duan: I'll let your curiosity here, like in terms of economic interest again, right about 160 00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.260 Jenny Duan: our games like. 161 00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.220 Jenny Duan: what do you find compelling about games? Or what do you find compelling about computer science? 162 00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:53.279 huda: Like, I think, the fact that 163 00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.400 huda: computer science, like just feels like such a 164 00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:06.879 huda: like foreign thing. But like it can be used for, like different things, like teaching people, and like telling stories that there's so much you can do with it, I think. 165 00:25:09.080 --> 00:25",
    ":10.520 huda: fascinated by like 166 00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:17.689 huda: like the art of like telling stories and teaching 167 00:25:18.331 --> 00:25:22.609 huda: and yeah, teaching through different mediums like 168 00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:27.960 huda: video games and other computer science projects. I guess. 169 00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, can you summarize that in 2 to 3 sentences. 170 00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.500 huda: yeah. So 171 00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.850 huda: I think, like. 172 00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:50.479 huda: I'm mainly fascinated by how technology can play a role in educating and telling stories, even though it's viewed as such. A 173 00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.289 huda: I don't know how to word this like 174 00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.030 huda: it's viewed as such a 175 00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.230 huda: like. 176 00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.689 huda: I don't know the word it's such like a boring subject. But like you could do. 177 00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.000 huda: I can't say boring, because then, like, it's like interesting to me.

And like voice student opinions on like the news. And so it like showed me how like like the power of like using like 196 00:27:51.480 --> 00:28:00.750 huda: how I said earlier, like using technology. But this time, like using video to like inform people about like different perspectives.

If you, if you think. 207 00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:43.529 huda: I was wondering if this, like academic interest like, does it require like what class you took, or something, or 208 00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.990 huda: Does that. 209 00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.150 Jenny Duan: Necessarily. 210 00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.590 huda: Okay. 211 00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.310 Jenny Duan: in college. 212 00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:57.519 Jenny Duan: I plan to pursue a major in computer science 213 00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.050 Jenny Duan: specifically focus on team development 214 00:",

    "huda: Yeah. 257 00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.520 Jenny Duan: Christmas. 258 00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.949 huda: Yeah, yeah. 259 00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.560 Jenny Duan: Cool. 260 00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.920 huda: Okay, these responses are pretty bad. 261 00:33:24.952 --> 00:33:26.879 Jenny Duan: It's okay, we can. 262 00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:32.270 Jenny Duan: It can change. I mean, this shows like how how much you've grown as a writer. Don't you think 263 00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.889 Jenny Duan: I feel like you've grown a lot as a writer. 264 00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:39.960 Jenny Duan: and. 265 00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.228 huda: Like how I wrote this and even submitted it. 266 00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.110 huda: Okay, 267 00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.230 huda: I think maybe I can talk about like. 268 00:33:50.550 --> 00:34:05.679 huda: So I mean, I'm mainly like, wait. I think I could make like different copies for my different teachers. But like this one if cause like for the my language teacher, which I like my Ap language teacher, which I think she writes like the best recommendations, and she's really selective with hers. 269 00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:14.059 huda: And also genuinely, she did like change my perspective on journalism. So I think I could maybe like write about how this like 270 00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.639 huda: this class, combined with media arts like 271 00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:23.380 huda: I kind of stemmed like, how I wanna in like infuse journalism 272 00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:24.400 huda: with 273 00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:35.490 huda: computer science cause like, I've always been like like a tech nerd, I guess, since I was younger, and so like this gave me like a new perspective, that these 2 things could be combined. 274 00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.199 Jenny Duan: think 275 00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:51.990 Jenny Duan: are you are, if you, if you like, write different versions. Are your teachers able to see the different versions or. 276 00:34:52.630 --> 0",
    "0:34:53.210 huda: We actually. 277 00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.810 Jenny Duan: Like. 278 00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:55.949 huda: We are just one 279 00:34:56.329 --> 00:35:05.469 huda: cause I know like, and I know they have to like. Put it through naviance. So like I'm not sure, if, like, we put these answers into naviance 280 00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:07.829 huda: actually don't know the process too well, but 281 00:35:11.499 --> 00:35:15.679 huda: actually like, I think it's safer to like not specialize it to someone. 282 00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.959 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I would recommend, probably not because I don't. 283 00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.770 Jenny Duan: If I can remember correctly. I don't think that now. The answer will distinguish. 284 00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.530 huda: Okay. 285 00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:34.980 huda: then, yeah, maybe like, I can talk about like how I've been like 286 00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:39.250 huda: a gamer since I was really young or like. And then 287 00:35:39.893 --> 00:35:49.370 huda: I've also been like tech nerd since I was young, and also really enjoyed like writing and reading books when I was young. So like all these things have like evolved in different ways and like 288 00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:54.200 huda: at the end of the day, kind of came together to like develop my passion. 289 00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:02.160 huda: I think. Yeah, I don't know how to like word it without like boring the teacher. So like. 290 00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.960 huda: okay. 291 00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:52.590 huda: wait. I don't know if I'm like overloading like all these things. But if I say that I I like games. I like reading and writing. I like tech is, do you think it's like too much, and like 292 00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.610 huda: they might see through that. 293 00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.099 Jenny Duan: Maybe if you separate it by 294 00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.585 Jenny Duan: by 295 00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.319 Jenny Duan: subject, and then 296 00:3",
    "7:04.690 --> 00:37:08.230 Jenny Duan: and then like, just write 2 sentences each. What do you think. 297 00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.310 huda: At an advantage. Yeah. 298 00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.740 Jenny Duan: And I'm missing. I think, like game development, computer science and journalism are like 299 00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:20.240 Jenny Duan: 3 biggest things for you. Is there anything else that you feel like you wanted to highlight about yourself. 300 00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:28.169 huda: I mean, I don't think it's really relevant. But like I also really enjoy history. But I don't think that's really relevant. 301 00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:32.670 Jenny Duan: Okay, I don't think you're gonna be applying for history program. So I feel like, that's 302 00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.630 Jenny Duan: not important. 303 00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:35.460 huda: Yeah. 304 00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:43.180 Jenny Duan: I also think, like at Stanford, Science Technology and society was a good program for you. 305 00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.290 huda: Yeah, actually. 306 00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.269 Jenny Duan: About this. 307 00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:58.010 huda: Decided on sts, and then and then I actually did a little more research into it. And I saw, like the concentrations. And I, there's like one specific, which is a concentration communication and media, and like. 308 00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.570 Jenny Duan: I. 309 00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:04.199 huda: That's a really great fit cause. It's also like talking about, like how technology and media interact. 310 00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.750 Jenny Duan: Yeah, perfect. 311 00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.740 huda: So also like, should I write about like 312 00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:17.504 huda: me like doing these thing actions as a kid like 313 00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.639 huda: I don't know if that's like 314 00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:24.180 huda: they share ads. Anything to like like what they could write about me. 315 00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.839 huda:",
    " Would I like? Include, like my classes that I've taken that like? 316 00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:46.115 huda: No, I think I think, like, okay for computer science. I know I can definitely like, talk about like attending hackathons in middle school, and like, how like bolstered my love for like 317 00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.100 huda: technology, I guess 318 00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.670 huda: on. 319 00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.997 huda: And I don't think I should mention like how both of my parents do tech.

Yeah. 323 00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.340 huda: Do you think this is fine for computer science? 324 00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.870 huda: Maybe I could see like further. 325 00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:55.519 Jenny Duan: I think you should elaborate what this means. What does this coding competitions online mean? 326 00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:59.179 Jenny Duan: I think like people wouldn't understand if they didn't have the Cs background 327 00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:06.390 Jenny Duan: like, I feel like, how did you get inspired to do this like, how did you start doing this? 328 00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.040 Jenny Duan: I think all of that is important. 329 00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:14.708 huda: But I don't really have an interesting story.

You can say 338 00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.130 Jenny Duan: you could take, and maybe we're the only girl, or like you were like the only 339 00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.400 Jenny Duan: something to like.

And let's finish the game development one. 359 00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:58.240 Jenny Duan: And then ",
    "since then, maybe you can say, since then I've learned to build my own 360 00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:04.269 Jenny Duan: like crafting new worlds via I don't know, and bridging my passion for ethics with 361 00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.459 Jenny Duan: something something through Centoria. 362 00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:22.719 huda: Yeah, I don't know if okay, wait.

I could talk about like how 369 00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.080 huda: I mean, like, I kind of talk about like how I say that 370 00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:31.929 huda: it's been like a notepad with the ink of my passion for different topics, like, yeah, ethics, education and storytelling. 371 00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.990 huda: and that's kind of like the origin. 372 00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.350 huda: And then I could say. 373 00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:55.560 huda: Should I talk about like distributing centuria to different schools? 374 00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.690 Jenny Duan: Mentioned Cynthoria at least somewhere, like just the name of your project. 375 00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.310 Jenny Duan: I think you can.

Like this like last sentence. 409 00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.310 Jenny Duan: Looks, good. 410 00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:42.930 huda: Okay. 411 00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:59.030 Jenny Duan: Tell us about a high school project or assignment that was most memorable to you. Why was this memorable to you? 412 00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:06.120 huda: Okay. I changed my mind after this because we had, like this other assignment in AV Lane, called Shark Tank. 413 00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:07.580 huda: and. 414 00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.300 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, we talked about this. 415 00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.039 huda: Yeah. And I wanted to talk about like, how. 416 00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.096 huda: So at 1st we wanted to do like a project which is like, 417 00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:22.975 huda: It was like, kind of stupid. It was like canceling out like brain rot, basically with 418 00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:25.699 huda: would like subliminal messages. 419 00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:38.378 huda: And so at first, st like, we were kind of really wanted to do that idea. But then we like got scared because there was like like the psychology teacher was saying that like, Oh, this is kind of like proven false like it wouldn't work and like 420 00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:54.051 huda: like it kind of taught me that. And then, like we kind of shifted away from i",
    "t. But I still kind of wish we went with that option because it taught us that like making big risks was taking big risks, would have like led to like 421 00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.500 huda: like better results, I guess, and like 422 00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:03.040 huda: I don't know. I think it taught me like risk taking factor, and that I should continue doing that in life. 423 00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:17.640 Jenny Duan: I think that's a good idea. I think risk taking is something that's like super undervalued and like demonstrates a lot about your personal character. I feel like the shark tank example is a really good one. 424 00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.399 Jenny Duan: Also, you can talk about like. 425 00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:25.010 Jenny Duan: you know, like 426 00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:29.100 Jenny Duan: collaborating with other people and having to like work together, to solve problems. 427 00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.139 huda: Oh, yeah. 428 01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.550 Jenny Duan: Okay, this is looking good. 429 01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.279 Jenny Duan: What were the impacts of this. 430 01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:20.800 huda: look up the project. 431 01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Did it work out. 432 01:01:24.311 --> 01:01:35.019 huda: Okay, so honestly like it went. So like, we kind of just did go for like the safer option. But like we like kind of like it was kind of like a mix like we pivoted to like. 433 01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:43.870 huda: We kept the same idea that we wanted to cancel out like rain or something, but like in like a different way. So we did like a project where 434 01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:56.609 huda: we like showed like educational games and stuff, and like provided like screen time, based off of like, how much you learn. And then like, that's kind of like what our product was like. But it was like 435 01:01:57.464 --> 01:02:02.200 huda: a bit different from like the original idea, but like improvising, I think. 436 01:02:14.500 -->",
    " 01:02:15.360 Jenny Duan: What's this? 437 01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.049 huda: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. 438 01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think we should finish all of this, the rest 439 01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.029 Jenny Duan: in another section. What do you think. 440 01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:49.539 huda: Yeah, I agree. 441 01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:56.059 Jenny Duan: Well, what would be a good time to meet for you? Tomorrow I'm pretty free, or like anytime this weekend 442 01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:57.889 Jenny Duan: we can discuss. 443 01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:04.039 huda: I think I should be available this like Saturday, like almost any time. 444 01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:08.320 huda: Yeah, whatever works best for you. 445 01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:15.100 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's do. Saturday. 446 01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.180 Jenny Duan: potentially. Saturday 447 01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.280 Jenny Duan: evening around 448 01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:24.929 Jenny Duan: 9 pm. Pacific time. Would that be okay? 449 01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.000 huda: Yeah, that's fine. 450 01:03:28.607 --> 01:03:32.480 Jenny Duan: Is that too late? Also too late in the morning? 451 01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.609 Jenny Duan: Okay, Fraysha. 452 01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.790 huda: Yeah, yeah. 453 01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:37.429 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 454 01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.769 Jenny Duan: I'll reach out to Mary to have that scheduled. Then. 455 01:03:41.998 --> 01:03:45.350 Jenny Duan: Okay, then talk to you. Then alright. 456 01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:46.609 Jenny Duan: bye, bye."
