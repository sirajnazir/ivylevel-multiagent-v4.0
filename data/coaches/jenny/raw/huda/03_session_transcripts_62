How's it going. 2 00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.240 Ivylevel: So. 3 00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.252 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 4 00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:42.979 Jenny Duan: I've been super super sick, so sorry about like missing the meetings. I didn't go to work today. I like have had a fever. The past couple of days. So like, yeah, sorry for being unresponsive. But I've had a chance to look at your essay and like excited to talk about that. But how are you doing. 5 00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:53.400 huda: I'm doing pretty well. I'm actually heading off to J. Camp tomorrow, so I'm a bit excited for that, but also a little bit nervous. But 6 00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.110 huda: yeah, I hope you're. I hope you feel better. Soon. 7 00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.579 Jenny Duan: Thanks. Yeah. Are you excited for J. Camp? It's gonna be such a good time. 8 00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.079 huda: Yeah, I mean, like. 9 00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.569 huda: I'm a bit like nervous, because, you know, this is our 1st time traveling alone and like. 10 00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:29.059 huda: like, I'm going to like a whole nother stay, and everything so feel like I'm a bit nervous for that. But I'm I'm really excited because they sent over the schedule and there's me like we get to like tour an actual like news station while they're like, live. So that's really exciting. So yeah, I'm really looking forward to that. 11 00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.429 Jenny Duan: That's so exciting. Have you been watching the Olympics also? 12 00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.769 huda: Oh, yeah, I have. 13 00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.349 Jenny Duan: What are your thoughts? 14 00:04:37.095 --> 00:04:51.350 huda: I just. I've loved Simone Biles since I was like really younger. So like, it's really cool to see her like actually like doing so well this year. I'm like, when I was younger, I actually wanted to be a gymnast. So like she was like, really my role model. 15 00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:11.040 Jenny Duan: That's so amazing. Yeah, I've really liked watching the Olympics, too. And like, there's a lot of Stanford athletes in the Olympics. So I've been like watching them compete. And that's been good, for example, like there's a lot of, I think a lot of the men's gymnasts go to Stanford, and then, obviously, like Katie Ledecky, the swimmer, and like other people, too. 16 00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.209 huda: Oh, well. 17 00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:28.059 Jenny Duan: So yeah, anyways, I thought we could spend today kind of focused on your college essay draft. I saw the new draft. I think it's like really good. I'm wondering if you could share 1st of all, just like, what are your thoughts on the draft so far and like what was your thought process going into it? 18 00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.530 huda: Yeah. So okay. So for, like the past 2 drafts, I was like. 19 00:05:33.862 --> 00:05:55.929 huda: I actually did have like my dad kind of look at them when he got back. And he like kind of said he. Kind of like kind of mentioned that like I was talking about my extracurriculars too much, and I kind of agree. And I feel like I've like read like past ones, and they don't really talk about the extracurriculars. So they're like I was trying to think of like something that's like, really like 20 00:05:56.477 --> 00:06:08.559 huda: unique to me. And especially since I'm like going into game development, and like something that makes me like unique in the field of game development. I think it's the fact that I'm a Muslim. And then, like. 21 00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.059 huda: I think I just kind of thought of like an instance like when like growing up like my parents didn't really let me 22 00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.400 huda: play like violin games that much 23 00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.629 huda: like violet as in like fortnite and stuff, but, like every other kid, is like allowed to play it. 24 00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.299 huda: But 25 00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.519 huda: I guess like 26 00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:48.230 huda: it's kind of I felt like I wasn't able to play because of like that date. Because of like this. September 11, th 2,001 like it kind of like. It's like all these, like stereotypes have like come across like Muslims and stuff because of that like in terms of violence. And so like, that's kind of like a big thing that's impacted me. And like my gaming. 27 00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.010 huda: But 28 00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.609 huda: yeah, that's like a big challenge that I faced growing up. So I was like, Oh, I should probably write about that. 29 00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.693 huda: And so 30 00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:03.829 huda: so first, st I guess in like the draft I wrote about like like the 1st experiences kind of has to do with like being a girl. 31 00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:15.969 huda: Kind of like cause, if you have like a like a female voice in like a call like it's just like, if you like, if you play video games with like voice chef, it gets like, really, really uncomfortable. So like 32 00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:35.320 huda: kind of like with experience that I've actually had. I've like, actually tried like masking myself. But like, yeah. And then after that, I go into like my Muslim identity, and how that has impacted me, which is kind of the main topic of the essay. But yeah, and then I stated, like an example of like one time I was like in middle school. And there's like 33 00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:42.450 huda: this, like, racist person like Minecraft. And it was like, yeah, I kind of like recall that I feel like. 34 00:07:43.107 --> 00:07:52.409 huda: maybe like my analysis of like coming over like getting over like that like kind of guilt. Maybe that isn't as clear in the essay. But 35 00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.469 huda: like, I think, yeah, I feel like I can explain that better. But 36 00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.250 huda: that's kind of like my thought process of making it. 37 00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.885 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 38 00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.999 Jenny Duan: I think that that looks. I think that the essay sounds really good, like, I really like the beginning of it. 39 00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.650 Jenny Duan: And like the 1st line, is super super compelling 40 00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.509 Jenny Duan: also just curious, like what's harder to write it on medium versus like Google Docs. 41 00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:26.307 huda: Oh, I wrote it on like notepad, and then I wanted to like share it on like, and then I wanted to share it like with my sister and stuff, and then 42 00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:32.310 huda: I just like I just put it on medium like as a draft like I didn't post it or anything but yeah. 43 00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.139 huda: like any dogs, I think just 44 00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.750 huda: I don't know. I just felt like the font was better in medium, and I don't. 45 00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.579 Jenny Duan: Oh! Totally! 46 00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.400 huda: I was able to write better. There. 47 00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.890 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, I think it looks really, I love the like the beginning and the 48 00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.609 Jenny Duan: I'm curious, like, I think that it's really strong in the 1st half. I think the second half 49 00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.530 Jenny Duan: could be a little bit stronger, the end part like what is sort of the the lesson or the 50 00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.494 Jenny Duan: take away that you're trying to impart onto the reader like I get it. I feel like, but I feel like the last 51 00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.890 Jenny Duan: sentence. It goes beyond like 52 00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:20.799 Jenny Duan: being called a terrorist. Right? It's it's like your culture, your pride, and your identity, and like the power that you derive from that. So I feel like that last sentence could be conveyed a little bit differently. But I'm curious to to hear your thoughts, and also, how long is this essay? 53 00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.930 Jenny Duan: It's like. 54 00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.000 huda: 545 words, I think last time I checked. 55 00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.059 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. But I'm curious, like in your words. What are you trying to convey about yourself from this. 56 00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:48.539 huda: I think, like it's kind of like a challenge that I face like feeling like I have to like, represent all Muslims at all times, and then maybe like maybe I could emphasize like like, how I was able to overcome that like kind of guilt, and like feeling 57 00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:57.520 huda: I feel like like you said. I don't know if I really like kind of conveyed that enough. But I think like. 58 00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:13.510 huda: maybe if I go into more detail where I'm talking about like like before the last sentence. If I kind of go more into detail, then I think I I'd be able to like show like my ability and overcoming that and like, and just like I guess, like playing 59 00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.059 huda: without like disturbances like this, and like 60 00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:23.189 huda: being able to like, overcome those challenges, maybe like that would kind of show my like resilience. I guess. 61 00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.929 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So. One thing that we can talk about maybe, is like 62 00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:49.808 Jenny Duan: what are the essential components of like a winning essay. I think that you already have, like a really good theme and a really good idea. And it's also like super personal, which is awesome. But I think that it's also important to like kind of name or demonstrate the traits about yourself that you're trying to show. So, for example, if we look at 63 00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.730 Jenny Duan: Have you heard of like the Costco essay. 64 00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.610 huda: I think I have. 65 00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me share it with you in case you haven't. 66 00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:05.930 Jenny Duan: It's really it's like a really famous college essay that, like, I think a lot of people reference. 67 00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.449 Jenny Duan: But it's all about this like character going to Costco and her observations. There. 68 00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.689 Jenny Duan: do you see it. 69 00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.809 huda: Yeah, I'm reading it right now. 70 00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.680 Jenny Duan: Cool. 71 00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.549 huda: It's so good. 72 00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.630 Jenny Duan: Isn't it good? 73 00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.330 huda: Yeah, I love like the analogy that she uses throughout, like 74 00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:54.589 huda: with with like the cart. I like the cart analogy towards the end. 75 00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:02.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think what this author does. A really good job is is weaving the analogy into like their own life. 76 00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:26.909 Jenny Duan: For example, like they use Costco as a starting point to talk about their curiosity about stories of you know their history, their family, like what they're curious about. Like. Do you see that at the end, she says, like Costco feels my insatchability and cultivates curiosity within me at a cellular level, encoded to immerse myself in the unknown, I find it difficult to complacently accept the what 77 00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:50.209 Jenny Duan: I want to hunt for the wise and dissect the house in essence I subsist on discovery. So the essay, while it starts with Costco like that's not quite what the story is about. She takes Costco as a starting point to like pivot to her own life, and what's greater, so I think that in that sense that's something that I'd love to see more of in your essay, too like trying to weave different examples in 78 00:14:50.210 --> 00:15:01.750 Jenny Duan: your own life, because I feel like yours right now is all about the situation where it's like all about what you're experiencing, but not like necessarily what you've taken away from it. Does that make sense so far. 79 00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.336 huda: Yeah, so 80 00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:18.830 huda: would you say like fixing this essay by like, you know? Adding, like what I've learned from it, and like how I grew from it. Do you think that would like possibly be a way to improve this essay or like? Do you think the topic in itself might not be like, is portraying. 81 00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.111 Jenny Duan: No, I think that the topic seems great. I think that 82 00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.740 Jenny Duan: All all that you could fix is maybe trying to add a little bit more personalization. So 83 00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:42.899 Jenny Duan: when you were talking about how to conceal your identity and game like things like that, you could weave in some conversation about your hair, which is something that you've talked about before, or any of the other facts that we did, that we got from our initial brainstorming exercise. 84 00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:50.519 Jenny Duan: and then you could talk about some other things. For example, like building a video game like learning about technology developing websites. I think all of that is 85 00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.459 Jenny Duan: is still really important. What do you think. 86 00:15:55.723 --> 00:16:05.240 huda: Yeah, I had a quick question. So like, you mentioned like adding, like game development building technology and everything. But like. 87 00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:22.520 huda: how would I be able to like add that in without kind of like talking about my extracurriculars? Cause I know that's like kind of not something that you're supposed to do in your essays and like, I'm not sure how to like talk about like game development technology without, you know, like mentioning either empowering AI or synthoria. 88 00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.960 Jenny Duan: So if we look back at the Costco essay for an example, in the second to last paragraph. 89 00:16:28.329 --> 00:16:44.540 Jenny Duan: there's a sentence that goes with car in hand, I do what scares me. I absorb the warehouse, that is, the world, whether it be through attempting aerial yoga, learning how to chart Blackbody radiation, using astronomical software or dancing in front of hundreds of people. I'm compelled to try any activity that interests me in the slightest. 90 00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:51.940 Jenny Duan: So that's like how you could weave it in. So, for example, you could say something like, if this were your essay, you could say like, whether it be through 91 00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:12.969 Jenny Duan: hosting a hackathon for a hundred young young girls learning how to code building websites that help people find jobs in their community, or, you know, making or writing like news bylines in my local paper, like, you know, you could fill it in with whatever is personalized to you. 92 00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.330 huda: Okay. Sounds good. 93 00:17:16.184 --> 00:17:17.680 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense. 94 00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.450 huda: Yeah. 95 00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.839 Jenny Duan: Cool! Oh, go ahead! 96 00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.049 huda: So, okay. So I think 97 00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:39.269 huda: over here, like on my essay, the second to last paragraph, I think there's definitely like space to do like one more paragraph, which is more reflective. And then do you think that would be like a good place to use like an analogy, or like? 98 00:17:39.369 --> 00:17:41.519 huda: Could it be more like straightforward. 99 00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:54.841 Jenny Duan: I think that since your whole thing is kind of an analogy, I think you could continue to just develop that analogy, but make it a little bit more personalized, and I also think that you can probably 100 00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:10.910 Jenny Duan: weave in a little bit more personalization into the like throughout your paper as well, I mean throughout your essay as well. So, for example, like, I really like the story about your dad constantly fighting against the terrorist stereotype, while you foolishly feed into the generalizations like, I think 101 00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:24.439 Jenny Duan: maybe you could. You could describe like what it's like. You know, at your school, or you know in your neighborhood, or just trying to make things a little bit more specific to you as a whole 102 00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:31.210 Jenny Duan: and then I think just like throughout your essay, you could add in some like fun facts about yourself, like 103 00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.580 Jenny Duan: Sprinkle some generation officeling, and speak only when necessary. Like. 104 00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.950 Jenny Duan: let's see 105 00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.790 Jenny Duan: sprinted over. 106 00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.120 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 107 00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.929 Jenny Duan: I think this like this 4th to last paragraph. Of course I wanted to win. I think you could make these 108 00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:01.479 Jenny Duan: these questions a little bit more specific to you, so you could say like. 109 00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:20.560 Jenny Duan: would I ever be able to? I don't know. Represent Xyz at the national level through because of this? Or would I ever be able to like be a leader because of Xyz? I think you could make those little bit more like you don't have to use those exact questions, but like something a bit more specific to you, could also be good 110 00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.366 Jenny Duan: And then 111 00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:47.930 Jenny Duan: I think that at the end again. I think you should defocus like the white American. 112 00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.200 Jenny Duan: the Midwest, though. Yeah. 113 00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:58.884 Jenny Duan: the Midwestern white boy. I think you can decenter them. And instead, like, say what you take away from this like, say, if I can 114 00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.140 Jenny Duan: create change in XYZ ways, then, like 115 00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.529 Jenny Duan: I will be able to do something different. 116 00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.810 huda: Wait. Sorry. Can you? Explain that again. 117 00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.171 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so you could say, like, 118 00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:24.129 Jenny Duan: like, you have continued to play games. And you've served as an advocate in the game making community. So maybe you could talk about your transition into that and say, like, if you can continue playing games and like 119 00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.809 Jenny Duan: games is just one barrier that you've broken, but like there are so many more possibilities. 120 00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.700 huda: Okay. So like, I could say something like. 121 00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.630 huda: if 122 00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.939 huda: if I'm able to continue gaming and advocating for 123 00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.060 huda: I'm 124 00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.780 huda: able to continue 125 00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.970 huda: gaming and advocate. 126 00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.750 huda: or more 127 00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.579 huda: Muslim Indian American girls. 128 00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.150 huda: Like me. 129 00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.129 huda: I will not, or 130 00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.660 huda: I will not let. Maybe. September 131 00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.830 huda: 11, th 132 00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.260 huda: 2,001 defining 133 00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:16.440 huda: me. 134 00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:30.700 Jenny Duan: Well, I think that it's beyond that. It's like you all. It's not just about that event, right? It's also about like, I think you touch on that event in the beginning. But I think after that you can talk about like the negative culture or the other barriers that are in the way 135 00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.579 Jenny Duan: also, where? Where are you typing? This is this on the. 136 00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.559 huda: I'm just editing the draft, like, I'm not sure if it's updating or. 137 00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.579 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, I don't think it updates on my end. But it's okay. As long as you retain a copy it should be okay. 138 00:21:45.258 --> 00:21:48.450 huda: I can. You know what? I'm just gonna transfer it to the Google, Doc? 139 00:21:57.017 --> 00:21:59.390 huda: I just put it all the way in the bottom. 140 00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.270 Jenny Duan: Okay, give me a second to take a look. 141 00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.829 Jenny Duan: Is this our normal dog, or is this a different dog? 142 00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.259 huda: I just sent in the chat. It's the jacked one. 143 00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.180 Jenny Duan: Okay. 144 00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.089 Jenny Duan: yeah, this is better. 145 00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:03.609 huda: I think I definitely need like a paragraph here. I don't know what I learned. Well, let me double check. How long this is. 146 00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:08.260 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could say like instead, comma like, and then something else. 147 00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.150 Jenny Duan: The end here. 148 00:23:14.344 --> 00:23:15.480 huda: For the last sentence. 149 00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.390 Jenny Duan: Because you will, you will not let it confine you. But then, like what else. 150 00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.090 huda: Instead. 151 00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.510 huda: I'll 152 00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.780 huda: build platforms 153 00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.960 huda: to 154 00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.390 huda: oh. 155 00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.100 huda: instead, I'll build platforms for them to 156 00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.840 huda: oh, for 157 00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.198 huda: I'm really sure how to word this 158 00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.210 huda: should I focus? Probably like my game development, or like 159 00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.120 huda: like 160 00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.440 huda: advocating? 161 00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.470 huda: Okay, kind of like mentioned that earlier. But 162 00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:29.499 huda: I'm able to continue gaming and advocate for more Muslim Indian American girls like me. I'm not allowed Islamophobia and prejudice to confine me 163 00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.580 huda: instead. Maybe 164 00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.590 huda: instead, use this to 165 00:24:35.197 --> 00:24:38.299 huda: fuel my passion to keep 166 00:24:39.091 --> 00:24:41.680 huda: breaking the boundaries of gaming. Maybe. 167 00:24:43.054 --> 00:25:04.289 Jenny Duan: I think that that sounds. But I think you want to be more specific about how you hope to break the boundaries of gaming, or how you see this relating to your life, like, for example, I think everything in the Costco essay, and I can get, like maybe be helpful to have other examples as well is very, very like specific. So you just want to be as specific as possible. 168 00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.619 huda: So like earlier, like I have like an example of like 169 00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:42.823 huda: saying, like 170 00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:44.610 huda: so 171 00:25:44.810 --> 00:26:06.539 huda: would I ever be able to win. And then this like specific competition, like Fortnite champion series, competition, without being reminded of September 11, th 2,001. And then here I could probably be if I wanted to be really, really specific. Then I could say like, instead, it would feel me to to win the competition, win this specific competition, and 172 00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.819 huda: ensure, like more people 173 00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:09.870 huda: to 174 00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.379 huda: I think that that might be too specific, like, I don't think that's like, really 175 00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.050 huda: the central focus of the 176 00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.480 huda: essay. So I don't know. 177 00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, like more specific about, like the qualities or the traits that you 178 00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.352 Jenny Duan: have learned, or that you have developed. For example, we could also look at 179 00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.562 Jenny Duan: You can also look at Maddie's 180 00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.089 Jenny Duan: Maddie's essay. If you do you have access to that. 181 00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.409 huda: I think. Let me check. 182 00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.150 Jenny Duan: Okay. 183 00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.065 huda: Okay. 184 00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.189 Jenny Duan: I don't think this is like a complete 185 00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.930 Jenny Duan: oh, charged! 186 00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.120 Jenny Duan: I don't think this is a complete draft of her essay. 187 00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.030 Jenny Duan: but I think, like the rest of it, if I can remember correctly, has, like 188 00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.154 Jenny Duan: more specificity in it. Let me look at for another. 189 00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:37.220 Jenny Duan: Another essay. 190 00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:06.459 huda: My dad actually had like a coworker and she went to Stanford like a while ago, so he sent me, like her essays to like, take a look at them and 191 00:28:07.053 --> 00:28:09.339 huda: I'm not sure if this is shared to you. 192 00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.099 huda: Okay, I just changed the access, but 193 00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.129 huda: it's pretty good. 194 00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.889 Jenny Duan: Can you give me? Is it the second link? Okay, perfect. Yeah. 195 00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.766 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 196 00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.040 Jenny Duan: if we can see this, this is also like a 197 00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.630 Jenny Duan: yeah, right here, there's like 198 00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.150 Jenny Duan: these, are these are the specific specificities right here. Do you see this. 199 00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.120 huda: Wait! 200 00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.969 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! No, you can't. Let me see. 201 00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.539 Jenny Duan: Forget that upcoming physics. C. Test, do you see? Oh, I don't. 202 00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.730 Jenny Duan: I don't know if you can see my highlighting. Yeah, there. 203 00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.802 Jenny Duan: that's like an area of specificity. 204 00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.579 Jenny Duan: this is like 205 00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.970 Jenny Duan: very specific. 206 00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:05.029 Jenny Duan: You take a strange delight in whipping out the old safety goggles to commence the 1st incision. 207 00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:12.229 Jenny Duan: So I think that here, as long as you're able to say like, How did you? Is this problem resolved and like, how did you resolve this? 208 00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:20.093 Jenny Duan: I think that's like the main question here, because I think in your essay, the resolution is, is not that clear? It's more like you. 209 00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.529 Jenny Duan: you you shut off your PC, 210 00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:30.649 Jenny Duan: so that seems like you're just quitting. But I think the question is like, How did you overcome this? If at all. 211 00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.489 huda: I think like 212 00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.089 huda: from there on I just kind of like didn't 213 00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:54.310 huda: I didn't exactly like listen to these kind of like trolls, and I was like able to still play the game like I'd I'd you know, put the same tactics as I did before, like masking myself as like a young boy, and then I'd like. 214 00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.610 huda: I guess it doesn't really show like 215 00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.140 huda: my. 216 00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:05.899 huda: I guess, like my passion and my identity. But I like sometimes like change. My avatar maybe like to not like look 217 00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:27.040 huda: look like me, and then but then also, like at the same time, I've done like advoc advocation. By like like supporting like other Muslim gamers. I've like and I've done lots of content regarding like gaming, and so like making it more like ex accessible. For like 218 00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:32.469 huda: more like, I guess marginalized people to play video games. Maybe. 219 00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:38.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, totally. So I think that that's like, kind of what we want to wrap into the end of the essay. 220 00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.946 Jenny Duan: So if you could. I think here, like, the idea is to 221 00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:48.679 Jenny Duan: include some resolution which is like inspiring girls to play video games like 222 00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:56.020 Jenny Duan: problem solving skills. Obviously, creativity, liking technology pursuing that 223 00:30:56.535 --> 00:31:00.460 Jenny Duan: so like, how do you feel like you were able to overcome this, if at all? 224 00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.319 Jenny Duan: Did you just get used to it. Did you do something to change the culture? Anything else. 225 00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:18.969 huda: Yeah, I feel like one. I did get to get used to like like the toxicity of like gaming culture, but at the same time like focusing on like building like a community which kind of has like less of that 226 00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:36.659 huda: kind of expectation, for example, would like not just specifically mentioned cinder, but like like developing games that, like, you know, represented these marginalized communities, or like my as being like a Muslim and an Indian. So like kind of 227 00:31:37.322 --> 00:31:40.039 huda: like building a community around which 228 00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:46.535 huda: supports like game gaming and like the culture. 229 00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.469 huda: I'm kind of like an intern. 230 00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.400 huda: Intersection. Yeah. 231 00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:59.790 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, so do you want to take a stab at writing a couple of sentences there or and then we can like, look over it. After that. 232 00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:14.279 Jenny Duan: I guess I feel like here. And here I feel like these issues. I feel like most of your essay right now is talking about the issues, but we want to make it more towards like the resolution, or how you overcame it. 233 00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.999 huda: there's just kind of like a random draft on it, so that's good, but. 234 00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.179 Jenny Duan: And totally fine. 235 00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.706 huda: This is just like a really really rough draft like paragraph. 236 00:36:29.117 --> 00:36:32.150 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is a good start. I'm 237 00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:47.210 Jenny Duan: I'm curious. If we could turn like the if we could maybe condense like the struggling part to like the 1st half, and then dedicate more just essay space to your like growth or your change. 238 00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:52.310 Jenny Duan: Do you think that that is like feasible. Given the scope of your essay? Or do you think that 239 00:36:52.759 --> 00:36:58.321 Jenny Duan: like that's not possible? If you want, I think maybe what we could do is like, continue to 240 00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.659 Jenny Duan: write more about your growth. And then we could cut down later on. That could also work. 241 00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.870 Jenny Duan: I think, yeah. 242 00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:20.499 huda: Like if we can write about the growth and then cut it down, cause there's definitely some kind of unnecessary parts, like like kind of concealing the identity. I think that could be removed as well. But like, I think it makes more sense if we kind of talk about like my growth, and then cutting. 243 00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.735 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Yeah. I think that what's missing here is just 244 00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.970 Jenny Duan: What's missing here is like. 245 00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:45.619 Jenny Duan: how what you've learned from it, and how these experiences have shaped you. I'm still not exactly seeing that like clear correlation there, cause it seems like it's like you were inspired to move on. But like what went into that process of moving on? Did you have any experiences? Or did you just like one day decide that you wanted to switch. 246 00:37:47.489 --> 00:37:56.760 huda: Well, I guess that was kind of like the main experience that, like like it made me realize like, why did I shut off my PC, why did I like 247 00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:08.310 huda: just kind of run away from the problem? It was like my, it was kind. I felt like it was like kind of my job not to like represent all Muslims, but to like make it possible for them to like 248 00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:17.219 huda: to like play games without players like that player, and also like it felt like my responsibility to like make sure this never happened to anyone else. So 249 00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.375 huda: I think that's kind of like how I decided to move on. And then, 250 00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.220 huda: yeah. 251 00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.750 Jenny Duan: Gotcha 252 00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.780 Jenny Duan: And okay, I think that 253 00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.840 Jenny Duan: yeah, this discussion about go pairs. 254 00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.503 Jenny Duan: It's good. 255 00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.850 Jenny Duan: I didn't win the game. 256 00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:53.499 Jenny Duan: I don't know, I think what you could do is like you could. There's a couple of directions I could see you taking this first.st You could talk about like 257 00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.540 Jenny Duan: rather than trying to exist within, like the 258 00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:04.208 Jenny Duan: the world of this game, you decide to build your own, and just like, Get out of that. You could talk about how 259 00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:15.069 Jenny Duan: like you continued playing, despite the experiences to show that you know, other people can as well but right now I feel like it seems a little bit 260 00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:26.454 Jenny Duan: like you just quit. But you're not really explaining like, why you or I mean, obviously, there's a reason why you quit. But you're not showing like how you got from quitting to 261 00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.260 Jenny Duan: like growing. 262 00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:36.340 Jenny Duan: I think you just say that you're growing, but it doesn't. You grew from go bears to 37. But 263 00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.430 Jenny Duan: it's not really clear like how you grew 264 00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.150 Jenny Duan: right right now. 265 00:39:42.253 --> 00:39:44.420 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? Or 266 00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.230 Jenny Duan: like? Does? Do you feel like. 267 00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.710 Jenny Duan: yeah, what do we. 268 00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:57.449 huda: Like like talking about like content creation and building video games. I thought that was kind of like my way of moving on from from like go bears, actions. 269 00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:03.119 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Yeah, I feel like, that kind of makes it seem like 270 00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.430 Jenny Duan: you're like. 271 00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:14.340 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if that shows that you're like resilient to your problems, or, if you like, run away from them in terms of like the way that you solve or look at problems in your life. 272 00:40:14.977 --> 00:40:23.299 Jenny Duan: Because we want to describe like, or we want to demonstrate how you deal with adversity and like how you can overcome that. But I'm not quite seeing like. 273 00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:30.030 Jenny Duan: If we just forget about this essay. And how would you say you like approach diversities in your life? 274 00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:54.630 huda: I honestly kind of like endure them. And I feel like it kind of stopped affecting me after like the instances that I've like had like when I was younger, cause it's also like cause like sometimes it's just like taken as a joke. But like I know, it's like a deeper meaning, but like feeling that like it's my fault that people like go bears like like 275 00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:05.249 huda: like. Think of Muslims in that way like I feel like I kind of grew from that by thinking like, these people are just like people on the screen online. And they're just trying to troll you. But like. 276 00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:17.679 huda: I don't know if that's like specifically like coming overcoming adversity. But like, I just kind of like started ignoring them and like I guess, like trying to move on by doing like my own projects. 277 00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.910 Jenny Duan: Gotcha, do you feel like 278 00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.510 Jenny Duan: that's so? 279 00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.269 Jenny Duan: Do you feel like that's demonstrated in this essay like that? 280 00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.840 Jenny Duan: I guess. Would you say you're ignoring them? Or what would you say 281 00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.340 Jenny Duan: you are doing. 282 00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:37.730 huda: I feel like in this 1st instance. I I don't ignore because I just like quit and that's because, like 283 00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:38.899 huda: I feel like 284 00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.400 huda: that was like me when I was younger, like when I was like like 11 or 12. 285 00:41:43.430 --> 00:42:01.220 huda: And at that time I really did not move forward from it. I was really affected. And I was like kind of like distraught at that time, and I was kind of more sensitive to these things because I hadn't endured them that much. But then, like like growing up and like having, like all these experiences, such as that one like, it's really been like. 286 00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.749 huda: almost like desensitizing. So like 287 00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:10.339 huda: it's like allowed me to grow a thicker skin, I guess. Around it. 288 00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. 289 00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.219 Jenny Duan: I would say. Maybe instead, what you could write about is saying like. 290 00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.280 Jenny Duan: maybe something to demonstrate the 291 00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:24.960 Jenny Duan: passage of time, so you could say like, Now you're at this age. And 292 00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.290 Jenny Duan: instead. 293 00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:33.860 Jenny Duan: you know, while you maybe don't play fortnight, and or maybe you grew out of fortnite for other reasons. You have taken on like this new 294 00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:45.920 Jenny Duan: you've like continued pushing in the game industry and like Xyz ways. But I think maybe that's like the the key there is demonstrating the passage of time, because I feel like right now it's like unclear what the timeline is, and like. 295 00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.399 Jenny Duan: I think it makes a lot more sense that like this was a long time ago versus 296 00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.780 Jenny Duan: how you are now. 297 00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:59.046 huda: Okay, so should I. Should I mention like on a school night, or like on a school night? 298 00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:04.399 huda: on a like a 6th grade school night, maybe, or something like that 7th grade. 299 00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.430 Jenny Duan: You could just say like 300 00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.869 Jenny Duan: but what I wouldn't realize. 301 00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.250 Jenny Duan: maybe at in 6th grade or something. 302 00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.290 huda: Okay. 303 00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:25.310 Jenny Duan: Was, there was much I did to grow was, I mean, instead of there was much I did. To grow. Was 304 00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.819 Jenny Duan: like the amount of opportunity to. 305 00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.840 Jenny Duan: you know, change or something 306 00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.310 Jenny Duan: from this. 307 00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:52.370 huda: Or I could be like go bears 2, 3, 7 wasn't my biggest enemy, but rather my cheerleader, because because he allowed me to he motivated me to like push the field of game in this the game industry to to open them for Muslim women. 308 00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.659 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So. Yeah, I think. Why don't we write that for now? 309 00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.370 Jenny Duan: Maybe instead of cheerleader, it could be like motivator. 310 00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.319 huda: I feel like it's it's kind of like funnier slash, like 311 00:44:32.588 --> 00:44:36.009 huda: more like interesting for cheerleader. But if. 312 00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.600 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that works. I mean, that works, too. 313 00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.780 Jenny Duan: I defer to what you think is best. 314 00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.230 huda: That's kind. That's nice. 315 00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:20.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I like this. See, I think this is like it feels much more smoother now compared to before, because I think before, like the context, and the setting didn't feel as smooth. But now it it's like more clear to see the logical connection. 316 00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:30.210 huda: Should I keep the go? There's 2 through. Son was slowly fading away because I didn't mention that he was like kind of one of the motivating factors to like keep game development. 317 00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:36.519 huda: so like, I don't know if that sounds like I'm getting less motivated or something like that. 318 00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:42.747 huda: or maybe I could say something like completely different could be like go bears. 2, 3, 7 was 319 00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:48.150 huda: is is lingering in my mind even, or is 320 00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:56.730 huda: lingering in my mind even stronger. To keep going, I guess. 321 00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:02.109 Jenny Duan: I don't. 322 00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.699 huda: Have to mention him again. 323 00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.159 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to mention me again, either. Yeah. 324 00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:08.150 Jenny Duan: greed. 325 00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:15.230 huda: Whether it be content creation to inspire girls to play video games or building video games of my own that represented Muslim girls. 326 00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.639 huda: I I took steps. 327 00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.719 huda: I am taking 328 00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.080 huda: steps 329 00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.900 huda: to 330 00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.359 huda: own a world where? 331 00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:40.350 huda: if you'll 332 00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.550 huda: guilt no longer. 333 00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.200 Jenny Duan: Right. 334 00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:53.300 Jenny Duan: I think that this this anecdote about San Francisco doesn't feel necessary here. 335 00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.901 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's a little bit 336 00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.169 Jenny Duan: out of place. 337 00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.020 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 338 00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.160 huda: Instead. 339 00:50:15.983 --> 00:50:17.350 huda: I will 340 00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.510 huda: use it 341 00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.599 huda: to fuel, my 342 00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.900 huda: relentless 343 00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.380 huda: I feel like I'll already on this, but, like 344 00:50:29.242 --> 00:50:31.740 huda: relentless passion to 345 00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.850 huda: destroy. 346 00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.690 huda: use or redefine. 347 00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:42.209 huda: These generalizations. 348 00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.380 Jenny Duan: I feel like, yeah, generalizations feels a little 349 00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.769 Jenny Duan: bra, but I think it's fine for now. 350 00:50:52.425 --> 00:50:53.470 huda: Violent 351 00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:58.730 huda: was. 352 00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:00.760 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 353 00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.010 huda: could I say, like prejudiced encounters. 354 00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:07.410 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that, too.

So. But what I didn't realize in 6th grade was that years was years later. 384 00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:07.750 huda: I would 385 00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.220 huda: when something greater. 386 00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.720 huda: a platform for advocacy. 387 00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.830 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 388 00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.490 Jenny Duan: Maybe like 389 00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.530 Jenny Duan: a voice for change or like. 390 00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:30.600 Jenny Duan: I don't know my own. 391 00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.440 Jenny Duan: What's another like game word you could use here. 392 00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.110 huda: wait!

So instead of like 395 00:54:47.720 --> 00:55:00.699 Jenny Duan: a platform for advocacy, you could make it, you could spin it into the add into the analogy again. So that's just like an example, for example, like your own quest, or I don't know but a platform of advocacy, I think, is fine, for now, too. 396 00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:07.760 huda: I could say like a Victory Royale of advocacy. Maybe 397 00:55:08.422 --> 00:55:09.270 huda: I don't know. 398 00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:11.720 Jenny Duan: Everything you have right now is fine, actually. 399 00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.030 huda: Yeah. 400 00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:30.150 huda: I guess. 401 00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:24.439 huda: Would you say like, when I say like, I feel my guilt vanish? Do you think that's like too like abrupt. 402 00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:32.060 Jenny Duan: I think it does seem a little bit abrupt. I feel like you can just take that sentence away and just don't have it, for now. 403 00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:32.970 huda: Okay. 404 00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.430 huda: Here, let me check the word sweet.

Even if it's like 1,000 2,000, we can always cut down. 412 00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.569 huda: Oh, yeah. 413 00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:02.389 huda: also this this paragraph. 414 00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:03.759 huda: Do you think 415 00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.170 huda: I can like? Add that 416 00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:12.399 huda: I think I should like shift, shift it to before when I say like I shut off my PC. I think it makes sense. 417 00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:14.210 Jenny Duan: Okay. 418 00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.750 Jenny Duan: I think that that sentence. 419 00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:20.289 Jenny Duan: yeah, you can probably take it down 420 00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.990 Jenny Duan: or move it. 421 00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.460 Jenny Duan: I think you can take it out because I feel like it 422 00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:28.930 Jenny Duan: reemphasizes everything that we've already discussed in the rest of it. 423 00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.115 huda: Okay. 424 00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:57.234 huda: okay? And then in terms of like adding like personalization to the rest of the essay. 425 00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:07.089 huda: do you have any like tips on like how I can go about that. And like, maybe, like specific parts of like my essay, which you think could use like a little more personalization. 426 00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:12.669 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like, let's go through it line by line. Can you hear you read this out loud in your voice? 427 00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:13.880 huda: Yeah, from the beginning. 428 00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:14.840 Jenny Duan: Awesome. 429 00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:26.730 huda: Most kids. Parents confiscated their children's video games as they grew too addicted, addicted to it. But my video games were confiscated even before I was born September 11, th 2,001, 430 00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:38.609 huda: like any bored child in the digital age. I played every game under the sun. Fortnite, roblox, valorant, Minecraft call of duty. You name it. I made attempts to conceal my identity and gain 431 00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:52.409 huda: hiding behind the user star girl 13 and other manipulated forms of my name, or even camouflaging myself as an 11 year old white boy, through meticulous process. Mess up my mic a bit, sprinkle some generation. Alpha slang. 432 00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:55.669 Jenny Duan: You can start like cutting some things down. 433 00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.509 huda: Sorry. What did you say? 434 00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:00.499 Jenny Duan: Okay, if I start cutting things down. Yeah. 435 00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:04.520 Jenny Duan: I'm just gonna put suggestions. You can. We can like delete them or keep them later on. 436 00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:05.430 huda: Okay. 437 00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.909 huda: unfortunately, like German shepherds to a crime scene. My teammates always sniffed out my identity. 438 00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:17.099 huda: Maybe it's my awkwardly placed teenage teenage girl terminology to blame. 439 00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:23.839 Jenny Duan: I think right here. This analogy, the German shepherds to a crime scene. Is there any way you can make this a little bit more personalized. 440 00:59:24.597 --> 00:59:26.540 Jenny Duan: For example, like 441 00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:32.149 Jenny Duan: instead of like German shepherds before to a crime scene you could. Is there another analogy you could use 442 00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.065 Jenny Duan: but like, for example, 443 00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:38.799 Jenny Duan: like. What's another thing you're able to dig up. 444 00:59:41.407 --> 00:59:46.832 huda: Like an animal crossing like you could like dig up fossils.

My dad, who got his suitcase forcibly inspected at an airport, for his suspicious name never proved of violent games, because he knew that's not what Muslims stand for.

Brown skin, long. 492 01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:44.509 Jenny Duan: I wanna like I was reading back at it.

He constantly fought against the terrorist stereotype, while I foolishly fed into them. 514 01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.800 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 515 01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.590 huda: And then I could just dupe on my face. 516 01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:12.860 Jenny Duan: I think that this 517 01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.489 Jenny Duan: part could be deleted. 518 01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.740 Jenny Duan: I think, because I think this is already like 519 01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:23.129 Jenny Duan: emphasizes the same points here. 520 01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:35.389 huda: Okay, I think, though, but like I think I might need like a sentence explaining like, how I think the important part was like how I felt like a like a face for Muslims like when I played.

    "tually wanted to be a gymnast. So like she was like, really my role model. 15 00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:11.040 Jenny Duan: That's so amazing. Yeah, I've really liked watching the Olympics, too. And like, there's a lot of Stanford athletes in the Olympics. So I've been like watching them compete. And that's been good, for example, like there's a lot of, I think a lot of the men's gymnasts go to Stanford, and then, obviously, like Katie Ledecky, the swimmer, and like other people, too. 16 00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.209 huda: Oh, well. 17 00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:28.059 Jenny Duan: So yeah, anyways, I thought we could spend today kind of focused on your college essay draft. I saw the new draft. I think it's like really good. I'm wondering if you could share 1st of all, just like, what are your thoughts on the draft so far and like what was your thought process going into it? 18 00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.530 huda: Yeah. So okay. So for, like the past 2 drafts, I was like. 19 00:05:33.862 --> 00:05:55.929 huda: I actually did have like my dad kind of look at them when he got back. And he like kind of said he. Kind of like kind of mentioned that like I was talking about my extracurriculars too much, and I kind of agree. And I feel like I've like read like past ones, and they don't really talk about the extracurriculars. So they're like I was trying to think of like something that's like, really like 20 00:05:56.477 --> 00:06:08.559 huda: unique to me. And especially since I'm like going into game development, and like something that makes me like unique in the field of game development. I think it's the fact that I'm a Muslim. And then, like. 21 00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.059 huda: I think I just kind of thought of like an instance like when like growing up like my parents didn't really let me 22 00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.400 huda: play like violin games that much 23 00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.629 huda: like violet as in like fortnite and stuff, but, like every other kid, is like",
    " allowed to play it. 24 00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.299 huda: But 25 00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.519 huda: I guess like 26 00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:48.230 huda: it's kind of I felt like I wasn't able to play because of like that date. Because of like this. September 11, th 2,001 like it kind of like. It's like all these, like stereotypes have like come across like Muslims and stuff because of that like in terms of violence. And so like, that's kind of like a big thing that's impacted me. And like my gaming. 27 00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.010 huda: But 28 00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.609 huda: yeah, that's like a big challenge that I faced growing up. So I was like, Oh, I should probably write about that. 29 00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.693 huda: And so 30 00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:03.829 huda: so first, st I guess in like the draft I wrote about like like the 1st experiences kind of has to do with like being a girl. 31 00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:15.969 huda: Kind of like cause, if you have like a like a female voice in like a call like it's just like, if you like, if you play video games with like voice chef, it gets like, really, really uncomfortable. So like 32 00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:35.320 huda: kind of like with experience that I've actually had. I've like, actually tried like masking myself. But like, yeah. And then after that, I go into like my Muslim identity, and how that has impacted me, which is kind of the main topic of the essay. But yeah, and then I stated, like an example of like one time I was like in middle school. And there's like 33 00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:42.450 huda: this, like, racist person like Minecraft. And it was like, yeah, I kind of like recall that I feel like. 34 00:07:43.107 --> 00:07:52.409 huda: maybe like my analysis of like coming over like getting over like that like kind of guilt. Maybe that isn't as clear in the essay. But 35 00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.469 huda: like, I think, yeah, I feel like I can explain that better. But 36 00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:",
    "59.250 huda: that's kind of like my thought process of making it. 37 00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.885 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 38 00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.999 Jenny Duan: I think that that looks. I think that the essay sounds really good, like, I really like the beginning of it. 39 00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.650 Jenny Duan: And like the 1st line, is super super compelling 40 00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.509 Jenny Duan: also just curious, like what's harder to write it on medium versus like Google Docs. 41 00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:26.307 huda: Oh, I wrote it on like notepad, and then I wanted to like share it on like, and then I wanted to share it like with my sister and stuff, and then 42 00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:32.310 huda: I just like I just put it on medium like as a draft like I didn't post it or anything but yeah. 43 00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.139 huda: like any dogs, I think just 44 00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.750 huda: I don't know. I just felt like the font was better in medium, and I don't. 45 00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.579 Jenny Duan: Oh! Totally! 46 00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.400 huda: I was able to write better.

I think the second half 49 00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.530 Jenny Duan: could be a little bit stronger, the end part like what is sort of the the lesson or the 50 00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.494 Jenny Duan: take away that you're trying to impart onto the reader like I get it. I feel like, but I feel like the last 51 00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.890 Jenny Duan: sentence. It goes beyond like 52 00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:20.799 Jenny Duan: being called a terrorist. Right? It's it's like your culture, your pride, and your identity, and like the power that you derive from that. So I feel like that last sentence could be conveyed a little bit diffe",
    "rently. But I'm curious to to hear your thoughts, and also, how long is this essay? 53 00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.930 Jenny Duan: It's like. 54 00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.000 huda: 545 words, I think last time I checked. 55 00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.059 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. But I'm curious, like in your words. What are you trying to convey about yourself from this. 56 00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:48.539 huda: I think, like it's kind of like a challenge that I face like feeling like I have to like, represent all Muslims at all times, and then maybe like maybe I could emphasize like like, how I was able to overcome that like kind of guilt, and like feeling 57 00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:57.520 huda: I feel like like you said. I don't know if I really like kind of conveyed that enough. But I think like. 58 00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:13.510 huda: maybe if I go into more detail where I'm talking about like like before the last sentence. If I kind of go more into detail, then I think I I'd be able to like show like my ability and overcoming that and like, and just like I guess, like playing 59 00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.059 huda: without like disturbances like this, and like 60 00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:23.189 huda: being able to like, overcome those challenges, maybe like that would kind of show my like resilience. I guess. 61 00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.929 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. So. One thing that we can talk about maybe, is like 62 00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:49.808 Jenny Duan: what are the essential components of like a winning essay. I think that you already have, like a really good theme and a really good idea. And it's also like super personal, which is awesome. But I think that it's also important to like kind of name or demonstrate the traits about yourself that you're trying to show. So, for example, if we look at 63 00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.730 Jenny Duan: Have you heard of like the Costco essay. 64 00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.610 huda: I think I have. 65 00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.",
    "179 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me share it with you in case you haven't. 66 00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:05.930 Jenny Duan: It's really it's like a really famous college essay that, like, I think a lot of people reference. 67 00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.449 Jenny Duan: But it's all about this like character going to Costco and her observations. There. 68 00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.689 Jenny Duan: do you see it. 69 00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.809 huda: Yeah, I'm reading it right now. 70 00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.680 Jenny Duan: Cool. 71 00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.549 huda: It's so good. 72 00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.630 Jenny Duan: Isn't it good? 73 00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.330 huda: Yeah, I love like the analogy that she uses throughout, like 74 00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:54.589 huda: with with like the cart. I like the cart analogy towards the end. 75 00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:02.460 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So I think what this author does. A really good job is is weaving the analogy into like their own life. 76 00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:26.909 Jenny Duan: For example, like they use Costco as a starting point to talk about their curiosity about stories of you know their history, their family, like what they're curious about. Like. Do you see that at the end, she says, like Costco feels my insatchability and cultivates curiosity within me at a cellular level, encoded to immerse myself in the unknown, I find it difficult to complacently accept the what 77 00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:50.209 Jenny Duan: I want to hunt for the wise and dissect the house in essence I subsist on discovery. So the essay, while it starts with Costco like that's not quite what the story is about. She takes Costco as a starting point to like pivot to her own life, and what's greater, so I think that in that sense that's something that I'd love to see more of in your essay, too like trying to weave different examples in 78 00:14:50.210 --> 00:15:01.750 Jenny Duan: your own life, because I feel like yours right now is all about the",
    " situation where it's like all about what you're experiencing, but not like necessarily what you've taken away from it. Does that make sense so far. 79 00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.336 huda: Yeah, so 80 00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:18.830 huda: would you say like fixing this essay by like, you know? Adding, like what I've learned from it, and like how I grew from it. Do you think that would like possibly be a way to improve this essay or like? Do you think the topic in itself might not be like, is portraying. 81 00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.111 Jenny Duan: No, I think that the topic seems great. I think that 82 00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.740 Jenny Duan: All all that you could fix is maybe trying to add a little bit more personalization. So 83 00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:42.899 Jenny Duan: when you were talking about how to conceal your identity and game like things like that, you could weave in some conversation about your hair, which is something that you've talked about before, or any of the other facts that we did, that we got from our initial brainstorming exercise. 84 00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:50.519 Jenny Duan: and then you could talk about some other things. For example, like building a video game like learning about technology developing websites. I think all of that is 85 00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.459 Jenny Duan: is still really important. What do you think. 86 00:15:55.723 --> 00:16:05.240 huda: Yeah, I had a quick question. So like, you mentioned like adding, like game development building technology and everything. But like. 87 00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:22.520 huda: how would I be able to like add that in without kind of like talking about my extracurriculars? Cause I know that's like kind of not something that you're supposed to do in your essays and like, I'm not sure how to like talk about like game development technology without, you know, like mentioning either empowering AI or synthoria. 88 00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.960 Jenny Duan: So if we look back at the Costco essay f",
    "or an example, in the second to last paragraph. 89 00:16:28.329 --> 00:16:44.540 Jenny Duan: there's a sentence that goes with car in hand, I do what scares me. I absorb the warehouse, that is, the world, whether it be through attempting aerial yoga, learning how to chart Blackbody radiation, using astronomical software or dancing in front of hundreds of people. I'm compelled to try any activity that interests me in the slightest. 90 00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:51.940 Jenny Duan: So that's like how you could weave it in. So, for example, you could say something like, if this were your essay, you could say like, whether it be through 91 00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:12.969 Jenny Duan: hosting a hackathon for a hundred young young girls learning how to code building websites that help people find jobs in their community, or, you know, making or writing like news bylines in my local paper, like, you know, you could fill it in with whatever is personalized to you. 92 00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.330 huda: Okay. Sounds good. 93 00:17:16.184 --> 00:17:17.680 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense. 94 00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.450 huda: Yeah. 95 00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.839 Jenny Duan: Cool! Oh, go ahead! 96 00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.049 huda: So, okay. So I think 97 00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:39.269 huda: over here, like on my essay, the second to last paragraph, I think there's definitely like space to do like one more paragraph, which is more reflective. And then do you think that would be like a good place to use like an analogy, or like? 98 00:17:39.369 --> 00:17:41.519 huda: Could it be more like straightforward. 99 00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:54.841 Jenny Duan: I think that since your whole thing is kind of an analogy, I think you could continue to just develop that analogy, but make it a little bit more personalized, and I also think that you can probably 100 00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:10.910 Jenny Duan: weave in a little bit more personalization into the like throughout your paper as well, I mean",
    " throughout your essay as well. So, for example, like, I really like the story about your dad constantly fighting against the terrorist stereotype, while you foolishly feed into the generalizations like, I think 101 00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:24.439 Jenny Duan: maybe you could. You could describe like what it's like. You know, at your school, or you know in your neighborhood, or just trying to make things a little bit more specific to you as a whole 102 00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:31.210 Jenny Duan: and then I think just like throughout your essay, you could add in some like fun facts about yourself, like 103 00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.580 Jenny Duan: Sprinkle some generation officeling, and speak only when necessary. Like. 104 00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.950 Jenny Duan: let's see 105 00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.790 Jenny Duan: sprinted over. 106 00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.120 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 107 00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.929 Jenny Duan: I think this like this 4th to last paragraph. Of course I wanted to win. I think you could make these 108 00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:01.479 Jenny Duan: these questions a little bit more specific to you, so you could say like. 109 00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:20.560 Jenny Duan: would I ever be able to? I don't know. Represent Xyz at the national level through because of this? Or would I ever be able to like be a leader because of Xyz? I think you could make those little bit more like you don't have to use those exact questions, but like something a bit more specific to you, could also be good 110 00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.366 Jenny Duan: And then 111 00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:47.930 Jenny Duan: I think that at the end again. I think you should defocus like the white American. 112 00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.200 Jenny Duan: the Midwest, though. Yeah. 113 00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:58.884 Jenny Duan: the Midwestern white boy. I think you can decenter them. And instead, like, say what you take away from this like, say, if I can 114 00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.140 J",
    "enny Duan: create change in XYZ ways, then, like 115 00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.529 Jenny Duan: I will be able to do something different. 116 00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.810 huda: Wait. Sorry. Can you? Explain that again. 117 00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.171 Jenny Duan: Yeah, so you could say, like, 118 00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:24.129 Jenny Duan: like, you have continued to play games. And you've served as an advocate in the game making community. So maybe you could talk about your transition into that and say, like, if you can continue playing games and like 119 00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.809 Jenny Duan: games is just one barrier that you've broken, but like there are so many more possibilities. 120 00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.700 huda: Okay. So like, I could say something like. 121 00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.630 huda: if 122 00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.939 huda: if I'm able to continue gaming and advocating for 123 00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.060 huda: I'm 124 00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.780 huda: able to continue 125 00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.970 huda: gaming and advocate. 126 00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.750 huda: or more 127 00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.579 huda: Muslim Indian American girls. 128 00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.150 huda: Like me. 129 00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.129 huda: I will not, or 130 00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.660 huda: I will not let. Maybe. September 131 00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.830 huda: 11, th 132 00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.260 huda: 2,001 defining 133 00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:16.440 huda: me. 134 00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:30.700 Jenny Duan: Well, I think that it's beyond that. It's like you all. It's not just about that event, right? It's also about like, I think you touch on that event in the beginning. But I think after that you can talk about like the negative culture or the other barriers that are in the way 135 00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.579 Jenny Duan: also, where? Where are you typing? This is this on the. 136 00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.559 huda: I'm just editing th",
    "e draft, like, I'm not sure if it's updating or. 137 00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.579 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, I don't think it updates on my end. But it's okay. As long as you retain a copy it should be okay. 138 00:21:45.258 --> 00:21:48.450 huda: I can. You know what? I'm just gonna transfer it to the Google, Doc? 139 00:21:57.017 --> 00:21:59.390 huda: I just put it all the way in the bottom. 140 00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.270 Jenny Duan: Okay, give me a second to take a look. 141 00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.829 Jenny Duan: Is this our normal dog, or is this a different dog? 142 00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.259 huda: I just sent in the chat. It's the jacked one. 143 00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.180 Jenny Duan: Okay. 144 00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.089 Jenny Duan: yeah, this is better. 145 00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:03.609 huda: I think I definitely need like a paragraph here. I don't know what I learned. Well, let me double check. How long this is. 146 00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:08.260 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could say like instead, comma like, and then something else. 147 00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.150 Jenny Duan: The end here. 148 00:23:14.344 --> 00:23:15.480 huda: For the last sentence. 149 00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.390 Jenny Duan: Because you will, you will not let it confine you. But then, like what else. 150 00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.090 huda: Instead. 151 00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.510 huda: I'll 152 00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.780 huda: build platforms 153 00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.960 huda: to 154 00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.390 huda: oh. 155 00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.100 huda: instead, I'll build platforms for them to 156 00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.840 huda: oh, for 157 00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.198 huda: I'm really sure how to word this 158 00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.210 huda: should I focus? Probably like my game development, or like 159 00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.120 huda: like 160 00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.440 huda: advocating? 161 00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.470 huda: Okay, kind of l",
    "ike mentioned that earlier. But 162 00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:29.499 huda: I'm able to continue gaming and advocate for more Muslim Indian American girls like me. I'm not allowed Islamophobia and prejudice to confine me 163 00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.580 huda: instead. Maybe 164 00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.590 huda: instead, use this to 165 00:24:35.197 --> 00:24:38.299 huda: fuel my passion to keep 166 00:24:39.091 --> 00:24:41.680 huda: breaking the boundaries of gaming. Maybe. 167 00:24:43.054 --> 00:25:04.289 Jenny Duan: I think that that sounds. But I think you want to be more specific about how you hope to break the boundaries of gaming, or how you see this relating to your life, like, for example, I think everything in the Costco essay, and I can get, like maybe be helpful to have other examples as well is very, very like specific. So you just want to be as specific as possible. 168 00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.619 huda: So like earlier, like I have like an example of like 169 00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:42.823 huda: saying, like 170 00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:44.610 huda: so 171 00:25:44.810 --> 00:26:06.539 huda: would I ever be able to win. And then this like specific competition, like Fortnite champion series, competition, without being reminded of September 11, th 2,001. And then here I could probably be if I wanted to be really, really specific. Then I could say like, instead, it would feel me to to win the competition, win this specific competition, and 172 00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.819 huda: ensure, like more people 173 00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:09.870 huda: to 174 00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.379 huda: I think that that might be too specific, like, I don't think that's like, really 175 00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.050 huda: the central focus of the 176 00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.480 huda: essay. So I don't know. 177 00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, like more specific about, like the qualities or the traits that you 178 00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.352 Jenny ",
    "Duan: have learned, or that you have developed. For example, we could also look at 179 00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.562 Jenny Duan: You can also look at Maddie's 180 00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.089 Jenny Duan: Maddie's essay. If you do you have access to that. 181 00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.409 huda: I think. Let me check. 182 00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.150 Jenny Duan: Okay. 183 00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.065 huda: Okay. 184 00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.189 Jenny Duan: I don't think this is like a complete 185 00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.930 Jenny Duan: oh, charged! 186 00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.120 Jenny Duan: I don't think this is a complete draft of her essay. 187 00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.030 Jenny Duan: but I think, like the rest of it, if I can remember correctly, has, like 188 00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.154 Jenny Duan: more specificity in it. Let me look at for another. 189 00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:37.220 Jenny Duan: Another essay. 190 00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:06.459 huda: My dad actually had like a coworker and she went to Stanford like a while ago, so he sent me, like her essays to like, take a look at them and 191 00:28:07.053 --> 00:28:09.339 huda: I'm not sure if this is shared to you. 192 00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.099 huda: Okay, I just changed the access, but 193 00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.129 huda: it's pretty good. 194 00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.889 Jenny Duan: Can you give me? Is it the second link? Okay, perfect. Yeah. 195 00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.766 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So 196 00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.040 Jenny Duan: if we can see this, this is also like a 197 00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.630 Jenny Duan: yeah, right here, there's like 198 00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.150 Jenny Duan: these, are these are the specific specificities right here. Do you see this. 199 00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.120 huda: Wait! 200 00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.969 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! No, you can't. Let me see. 201 00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.539 Jenny Duan: Forget that upcoming physics. C. Test, do y",
    "ou see? Oh, I don't. 202 00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.730 Jenny Duan: I don't know if you can see my highlighting. Yeah, there. 203 00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.802 Jenny Duan: that's like an area of specificity. 204 00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.579 Jenny Duan: this is like 205 00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.970 Jenny Duan: very specific. 206 00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:05.029 Jenny Duan: You take a strange delight in whipping out the old safety goggles to commence the 1st incision. 207 00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:12.229 Jenny Duan: So I think that here, as long as you're able to say like, How did you? Is this problem resolved and like, how did you resolve this? 208 00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:20.093 Jenny Duan: I think that's like the main question here, because I think in your essay, the resolution is, is not that clear? It's more like you. 209 00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.529 Jenny Duan: you you shut off your PC, 210 00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:30.649 Jenny Duan: so that seems like you're just quitting. But I think the question is like, How did you overcome this? If at all. 211 00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.489 huda: I think like 212 00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.089 huda: from there on I just kind of like didn't 213 00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:54.310 huda: I didn't exactly like listen to these kind of like trolls, and I was like able to still play the game like I'd I'd you know, put the same tactics as I did before, like masking myself as like a young boy, and then I'd like. 214 00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.610 huda: I guess it doesn't really show like 215 00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.140 huda: my. 216 00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:05.899 huda: I guess, like my passion and my identity. But I like sometimes like change. My avatar maybe like to not like look 217 00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:27.040 huda: look like me, and then but then also, like at the same time, I've done like advoc advocation. By like like supporting like other Muslim gamers. I've like and I've done lots of content regarding like gaming, and so like making it mor",
    "e like ex accessible. For like 218 00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:32.469 huda: more like, I guess marginalized people to play video games. Maybe. 219 00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:38.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, totally. So I think that that's like, kind of what we want to wrap into the end of the essay. 220 00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.946 Jenny Duan: So if you could. I think here, like, the idea is to 221 00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:48.679 Jenny Duan: include some resolution which is like inspiring girls to play video games like 222 00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:56.020 Jenny Duan: problem solving skills. Obviously, creativity, liking technology pursuing that 223 00:30:56.535 --> 00:31:00.460 Jenny Duan: so like, how do you feel like you were able to overcome this, if at all? 224 00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.319 Jenny Duan: Did you just get used to it. Did you do something to change the culture? Anything else. 225 00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:18.969 huda: Yeah, I feel like one. I did get to get used to like like the toxicity of like gaming culture, but at the same time like focusing on like building like a community which kind of has like less of that 226 00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:36.659 huda: kind of expectation, for example, would like not just specifically mentioned cinder, but like like developing games that, like, you know, represented these marginalized communities, or like my as being like a Muslim and an Indian. So like kind of 227 00:31:37.322 --> 00:31:40.039 huda: like building a community around which 228 00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:46.535 huda: supports like game gaming and like the culture. 229 00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.469 huda: I'm kind of like an intern. 230 00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.400 huda: Intersection. Yeah. 231 00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:59.790 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, so do you want to take a stab at writing a couple of sentences there or and then we can like, look over it. After that. 232 00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:14.279 Jenny Duan: I guess I feel like here. And here I feel like these issues. I ",
    "feel like most of your essay right now is talking about the issues, but we want to make it more towards like the resolution, or how you overcame it. 233 00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.999 huda: there's just kind of like a random draft on it, so that's good, but. 234 00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.179 Jenny Duan: And totally fine. 235 00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.706 huda: This is just like a really really rough draft like paragraph. 236 00:36:29.117 --> 00:36:32.150 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is a good start. I'm 237 00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:47.210 Jenny Duan: I'm curious. If we could turn like the if we could maybe condense like the struggling part to like the 1st half, and then dedicate more just essay space to your like growth or your change. 238 00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:52.310 Jenny Duan: Do you think that that is like feasible. Given the scope of your essay? Or do you think that 239 00:36:52.759 --> 00:36:58.321 Jenny Duan: like that's not possible? If you want, I think maybe what we could do is like, continue to 240 00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.659 Jenny Duan: write more about your growth. And then we could cut down later on. That could also work. 241 00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.870 Jenny Duan: I think, yeah. 242 00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:20.499 huda: Like if we can write about the growth and then cut it down, cause there's definitely some kind of unnecessary parts, like like kind of concealing the identity. I think that could be removed as well. But like, I think it makes more sense if we kind of talk about like my growth, and then cutting. 243 00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.735 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Yeah. I think that what's missing here is just 244 00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.970 Jenny Duan: What's missing here is like. 245 00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:45.619 Jenny Duan: how what you've learned from it, and how these experiences have shaped you. I'm still not exactly seeing that like clear correlation there, cause it seems like it's like you were inspired to move on. But like what went into",
    " that process of moving on? Did you have any experiences? Or did you just like one day decide that you wanted to switch. 246 00:37:47.489 --> 00:37:56.760 huda: Well, I guess that was kind of like the main experience that, like like it made me realize like, why did I shut off my PC, why did I like 247 00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:08.310 huda: just kind of run away from the problem? It was like my, it was kind. I felt like it was like kind of my job not to like represent all Muslims, but to like make it possible for them to like 248 00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:17.219 huda: to like play games without players like that player, and also like it felt like my responsibility to like make sure this never happened to anyone else. So 249 00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.375 huda: I think that's kind of like how I decided to move on. And then, 250 00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.220 huda: yeah. 251 00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.750 Jenny Duan: Gotcha 252 00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.780 Jenny Duan: And okay, I think that 253 00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.840 Jenny Duan: yeah, this discussion about go pairs. 254 00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.503 Jenny Duan: It's good. 255 00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.850 Jenny Duan: I didn't win the game. 256 00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:53.499 Jenny Duan: I don't know, I think what you could do is like you could. There's a couple of directions I could see you taking this first.st You could talk about like 257 00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.540 Jenny Duan: rather than trying to exist within, like the 258 00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:04.208 Jenny Duan: the world of this game, you decide to build your own, and just like, Get out of that. You could talk about how 259 00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:15.069 Jenny Duan: like you continued playing, despite the experiences to show that you know, other people can as well but right now I feel like it seems a little bit 260 00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:26.454 Jenny Duan: like you just quit. But you're not really explaining like, why you or I mean, obviously, there's a reason wh",
    "y you quit. But you're not showing like how you got from quitting to 261 00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.260 Jenny Duan: like growing. 262 00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:36.340 Jenny Duan: I think you just say that you're growing, but it doesn't. You grew from go bears to 37. But 263 00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.430 Jenny Duan: it's not really clear like how you grew 264 00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.150 Jenny Duan: right right now. 265 00:39:42.253 --> 00:39:44.420 Jenny Duan: Does that make sense? Or 266 00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.230 Jenny Duan: like? Does? Do you feel like. 267 00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.710 Jenny Duan: yeah, what do we. 268 00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:57.449 huda: Like like talking about like content creation and building video games. I thought that was kind of like my way of moving on from from like go bears, actions. 269 00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:03.119 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Yeah, I feel like, that kind of makes it seem like 270 00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.430 Jenny Duan: you're like. 271 00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:14.340 Jenny Duan: I'm not sure if that shows that you're like resilient to your problems, or, if you like, run away from them in terms of like the way that you solve or look at problems in your life. 272 00:40:14.977 --> 00:40:23.299 Jenny Duan: Because we want to describe like, or we want to demonstrate how you deal with adversity and like how you can overcome that. But I'm not quite seeing like. 273 00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:30.030 Jenny Duan: If we just forget about this essay. And how would you say you like approach diversities in your life? 274 00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:54.630 huda: I honestly kind of like endure them. And I feel like it kind of stopped affecting me after like the instances that I've like had like when I was younger, cause it's also like cause like sometimes it's just like taken as a joke. But like I know, it's like a deeper meaning, but like feeling that like it's my fault that people like go bears like like 275 00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:05.249 huda: like",
    ". Think of Muslims in that way like I feel like I kind of grew from that by thinking like, these people are just like people on the screen online. And they're just trying to troll you. But like. 276 00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:17.679 huda: I don't know if that's like specifically like coming overcoming adversity. But like, I just kind of like started ignoring them and like I guess, like trying to move on by doing like my own projects. 277 00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.910 Jenny Duan: Gotcha, do you feel like 278 00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.510 Jenny Duan: that's so? 279 00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.269 Jenny Duan: Do you feel like that's demonstrated in this essay like that? 280 00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.840 Jenny Duan: I guess. Would you say you're ignoring them? Or what would you say 281 00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.340 Jenny Duan: you are doing. 282 00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:37.730 huda: I feel like in this 1st instance. I I don't ignore because I just like quit and that's because, like 283 00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:38.899 huda: I feel like 284 00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.400 huda: that was like me when I was younger, like when I was like like 11 or 12. 285 00:41:43.430 --> 00:42:01.220 huda: And at that time I really did not move forward from it. I was really affected. And I was like kind of like distraught at that time, and I was kind of more sensitive to these things because I hadn't endured them that much. But then, like like growing up and like having, like all these experiences, such as that one like, it's really been like. 286 00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.749 huda: almost like desensitizing. So like 287 00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:10.339 huda: it's like allowed me to grow a thicker skin, I guess. Around it. 288 00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. 289 00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.219 Jenny Duan: I would say. Maybe instead, what you could write about is saying like. 290 00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.280 Jenny Duan: maybe something to demonstrate the 291 00:42",
    ":19.690 --> 00:42:24.960 Jenny Duan: passage of time, so you could say like, Now you're at this age. And 292 00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.290 Jenny Duan: instead. 293 00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:33.860 Jenny Duan: you know, while you maybe don't play fortnight, and or maybe you grew out of fortnite for other reasons. You have taken on like this new 294 00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:45.920 Jenny Duan: you've like continued pushing in the game industry and like Xyz ways. But I think maybe that's like the the key there is demonstrating the passage of time, because I feel like right now it's like unclear what the timeline is, and like. 295 00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.399 Jenny Duan: I think it makes a lot more sense that like this was a long time ago versus 296 00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.780 Jenny Duan: how you are now. 297 00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:59.046 huda: Okay, so should I. Should I mention like on a school night, or like on a school night? 298 00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:04.399 huda: on a like a 6th grade school night, maybe, or something like that 7th grade. 299 00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.430 Jenny Duan: You could just say like 300 00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.869 Jenny Duan: but what I wouldn't realize. 301 00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.250 Jenny Duan: maybe at in 6th grade or something. 302 00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.290 huda: Okay. 303 00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:25.310 Jenny Duan: Was, there was much I did to grow was, I mean, instead of there was much I did. To grow. Was 304 00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.819 Jenny Duan: like the amount of opportunity to. 305 00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.840 Jenny Duan: you know, change or something 306 00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.310 Jenny Duan: from this. 307 00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:52.370 huda: Or I could be like go bears 2, 3, 7 wasn't my biggest enemy, but rather my cheerleader, because because he allowed me to he motivated me to like push the field of game in this the game industry to to open them for Muslim women. 308 00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.659 Jenny Duan: Yeah, ",
    "exactly. So. Yeah, I think. Why don't we write that for now? 309 00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.370 Jenny Duan: Maybe instead of cheerleader, it could be like motivator. 310 00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.319 huda: I feel like it's it's kind of like funnier slash, like 311 00:44:32.588 --> 00:44:36.009 huda: more like interesting for cheerleader. But if. 312 00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.600 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that works. I mean, that works, too. 313 00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.780 Jenny Duan: I defer to what you think is best. 314 00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.230 huda: That's kind. That's nice. 315 00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:20.249 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I like this. See, I think this is like it feels much more smoother now compared to before, because I think before, like the context, and the setting didn't feel as smooth. But now it it's like more clear to see the logical connection. 316 00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:30.210 huda: Should I keep the go? There's 2 through. Son was slowly fading away because I didn't mention that he was like kind of one of the motivating factors to like keep game development. 317 00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:36.519 huda: so like, I don't know if that sounds like I'm getting less motivated or something like that. 318 00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:42.747 huda: or maybe I could say something like completely different could be like go bears. 2, 3, 7 was 319 00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:48.150 huda: is is lingering in my mind even, or is 320 00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:56.730 huda: lingering in my mind even stronger. To keep going, I guess. 321 00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:02.109 Jenny Duan: I don't. 322 00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.699 huda: Have to mention him again. 323 00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.159 Jenny Duan: I don't think you need to mention me again, either.
