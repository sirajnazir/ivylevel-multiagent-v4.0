Huda! How's it going. 6 00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.119 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 7 00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.700 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. Yeah, any how was your weekend? Any updates. 8 00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:02.889 huda: It was really good, I think. I've been like a bit busy, especially there was like a lot of summer homework. I had to catch up on. I'm trying to finish it before I head off J camp. 9 00:06:03.282 --> 00:06:08.930 huda: And like I got my schedule back, some of it terrified for the next year, but. 10 00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.299 Jenny Duan: Oh, what's your schedule looking like? Why are you terrified. 11 00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.294 huda: It's like all my like father piece are back to back, and then 12 00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.440 Jenny Duan: Wow! 13 00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:21.169 huda: Yeah. And then it's like 14 00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.300 huda: no easy periods, basically. So I'm kind of scared. 15 00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.430 Jenny Duan: Well, 16 00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.100 Jenny Duan: Do you still feel confident everything that you are doing? Or do you have any like 17 00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.500 Jenny Duan: any classes or any specific things that you wanted to talk through. 18 00:06:39.520 --> 00:07:04.829 huda: Yeah, I was thinking, like, I was thinking of kind of switching out one of the Ap's cause. I don't know if I could handle like 5 Ap's in senior year, and cause there's also many other activities. And second semester I might not want to like. I might not be as motivated to do classwork. So I was thinking like of dropping, maybe ap psychology, which I think I just took it because it's like an Ap. But. 19 00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.360 Jenny Duan: Maybe psych is like pretty easy, though. So I feel like that was not gonna not gonna be the one that. 20 00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.449 huda: Yeah, I think I just I wanted to like drop in like, maybe take like a class like ceramics or something like 21 00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.889 huda: something that's like 22 00:07:20.327 --> 00:07:21.610 huda: you know, more 23 00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.739 huda: like, I guess more fun. But yeah. 24 00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.279 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay? I think. 25 00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:35.309 Jenny Duan: okay, in terms of like college applications. I think if you drop a an Ap 26 00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.107 Jenny Duan: in like, it's gonna be harder to 27 00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.560 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's gonna be harder to go to like a top 5 school. But I also think that like 28 00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.740 Jenny Duan: it's up to you ultimately, because I think, like 29 00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.210 Jenny Duan: most people in their senior year at top schools like. 30 00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:07.510 Jenny Duan: I think, will take 6 or 7. So to be competitive. It's like very much. You kind of just have to get through 1st semester, because once you're done with 1st semester, you can be fine and like. 31 00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.960 Jenny Duan: just do second semester and chill out once you get into college. But I think it's like 32 00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:29.190 Jenny Duan: that's like the honest truth. But like it is also like a personal choice, because I know, like taking a lot of Ap's is not always the best idea, especially if you get worse grades in those. Ap. So I think it's a balance between like trying to get the most rigorous schedule as possible, while also like 33 00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.621 Jenny Duan: trying to balance getting good grades as well. 34 00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:45.970 Jenny Duan: So that's like the main thing. I do think that for Stanford, if you're if you're still trying to apply Rea, I do think it's better for you to take 5 or even 6 Ap's. 35 00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.110 Jenny Duan: But 36 00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.770 Jenny Duan: that just depends on if you feel like you're gonna do well in those classes. 37 00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.959 Jenny Duan: But or not. 38 00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.389 Jenny Duan: because, yeah. 39 00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.589 huda: I don't know. I'm. 40 00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.650 Jenny Duan: Second semester grades don't really matter. 41 00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.400 huda: Yeah, I I don't know. I feel like 42 00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:21.410 huda: cause like in in our school, like second semester. You can't. You can't like drop it, or anything like you have to continue taking it, and then like, I don't know if I want to do that like I I'm fine with doing stuff 1st semester, which I know it might be hectic. But like, you know, it's like a lot of work. But yeah, like, I'm willing to put that in. But then I feel like second semester. I kind of wanna like. 43 00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.209 huda: have that more laid laid back. But 44 00:09:26.053 --> 00:09:33.029 huda: yeah, I'm still kind of thinking through it, and then, like, I think I'll like have to decide before August first, st and then. 45 00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.300 Jenny Duan: Oh, you have 3 days. 46 00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:34.629 huda: In, the. 47 00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.940 Jenny Duan: Side only. 48 00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:36.765 huda: Yeah. 49 00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.910 Jenny Duan: When did you get the schedule? Oh, no. 50 00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.610 huda: Like on Friday. 51 00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.580 Jenny Duan: Oh, shoot. Okay. 52 00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.539 Jenny Duan: So you basically only have, like, 5 days to decide. Okay. 53 00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.210 huda: Yeah. 54 00:09:51.854 --> 00:09:58.595 Jenny Duan: Okay. Well, I think the honest advice is that like to be competitive for Stanford and other Iv leagues 55 00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.829 Jenny Duan: like Upen mit, etc. 56 00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.490 Jenny Duan: I think it's really important that if you want to be competitive to take as many a piece as possible. 57 00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:16.849 Jenny Duan: but if you don't care as much about those schools. Then it doesn't really matter. 58 00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.930 huda: Okay. 59 00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.589 huda: yeah, I think I feel like. 60 00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:32.970 huda: I think I'm just gonna keep it. And then, yeah, see if I could handle. And then, if if not, I can see if I can try and talking to like my counselor later on in the year. But like, I don't know if anything's possible. But like. 61 00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.590 huda: yeah, I think I'm just gonna stick with my my schedule. 62 00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:51.320 Jenny Duan: Okay. But I think as long as you do find the 1st semester, second semester doesn't really matter, because even if you get see, like once you get into, once you get accepted into a college like they probably are not gonna rescind you for any reason 63 00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.710 Jenny Duan: like regardless. So 64 00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:55.929 Jenny Duan: as long as. 65 00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.309 huda: For 1st semester. Are you supposed to be trying to get an a in all your classes as well. 66 00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because for regular decision, they look at your semester grades due in January. 67 00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.170 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 68 00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.630 Jenny Duan: So make sure that your Gp. Doesn't tank in your 1st semester. 69 00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:16.610 huda: Okay. Now, let's look a little bit more scary. 70 00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.010 huda: I mean. 71 00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:26.070 Jenny Duan: Okay for re restricted early action. Like, if you get in early action, then oh, it also doesn't matter. But if you 72 00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.905 Jenny Duan: if you do 73 00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:38.559 Jenny Duan: If you if you do apply regular decision for schools, then obviously, they're gonna check your your 1st semester grades. 74 00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.950 huda: Okay. 75 00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.090 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So what are you thinking right? Now? If anything. 76 00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.280 huda: I think like 77 00:11:49.880 --> 00:12:03.669 huda: I just like I don't know. Some of the classes are like hard like, I know ap lit like personally, like. I've seen people from my school. They say it's like one of the hardest Ap's, and so like I feel like that might like affect my Gva. 78 00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:10.549 huda: And then I know we're like, and I think I'm applying to like Stanford for regular decisions. So that's kind of like concerning. 79 00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.950 Jenny Duan: That, but. 80 00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.589 huda: Like, I mean, obviously. 81 00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.889 Jenny Duan: I think you said you were gonna do it for Rea. Is that still the case? 82 00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.549 huda: Oh, yeah, yeah, we're doing. I think I was doing Usc. And Stanford as well. 83 00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.189 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Usc. And Stanford for early action. 84 00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.100 huda: Okay, then, yeah. 85 00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:33.139 huda: okay, then, that's fine. Cause, like the other colleges, like, I obviously do like wanna apply to them. But I feel like 86 00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:44.400 huda: like, I mean, it's not guaranteed that I do bad in the classes, but even if, like, I'm not as like concerned as like with Stanford and Usc cause those are like kind of like my top 2 options 87 00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.500 huda: and and the Ucs as well. So I think 88 00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.690 huda: I think that should be fine. Then. 89 00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.580 Jenny Duan: Okay? Cause? Yeah, the Ucs are also like early. So they're not gonna see her 90 00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.550 Jenny Duan: for sister grade until 91 00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:10.149 Jenny Duan: I guess you have to send them or something. But okay, then, I think as long as you feel fine, then, as long as you know the the consequences, the pros and cons of both. 92 00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:17.030 Jenny Duan: Like, I guess. Yeah, as long as you're fully aware of what you're signing up for, then. Yeah, I think that's all that matters. 93 00:13:17.457 --> 00:13:23.360 Jenny Duan: Can you reiterate, which Ap's that you're taking again. So ap lit is one of them. What else. 94 00:13:24.354 --> 00:13:26.450 huda: Ap lit ap stats 95 00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.760 huda: ab gov and econ 96 00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:34.949 huda: and then I think that like counts as 2, and then ap Spanish and 97 00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.460 huda: a P. 98 00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.685 huda: Wait 99 00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.010 huda: We didn't mention all of them. I'm not sure. Wait 100 00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.940 huda: one second. Let me get my schedule. 101 00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.830 Jenny Duan: No problem. 102 00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.099 huda: Oh, sorry. Okay, basically, I have 103 00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.189 huda: ap lit ap stats ap Spanish ap Gov and ap psychology. 104 00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:18.420 huda: And then, like, outside of that, I have like a capstone computer science class, and like, just like a mandatory adulting class. 105 00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.210 Jenny Duan: What is a dilting class? I've never heard of that before. 106 00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.760 huda: It's like, basically like you could do like mock interviews. And then you get to like, learn about finances and stuff. It's just like 107 00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.460 huda: it's pretty interesting. 108 00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.010 huda: It's like a mandatory course for everyone in the grade. 109 00:14:35.367 --> 00:14:41.449 Jenny Duan: So you have a Cs capstone Api lit. What else? Again remind me, I'm writing these down. 110 00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:49.570 huda: Yeah, so I have ap or I have a computer science capstone. I have ap lit. I have ap statistics 111 00:14:50.486 --> 00:14:51.940 huda: ap Spanish 112 00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.329 huda: and Ap. Gov. And Ap. Econ 113 00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.669 huda: and Ap. Psychology. 114 00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.629 Jenny Duan: Macroeconomics, or micro. 115 00:15:00.714 --> 00:15:09.509 huda: I think it's Macro. I'm not sure like right now on my schedule. It just says Gov. But in the second semester I'm taking like another phone class. 116 00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.690 huda: I think I'm pretty sure it's like early economics. 117 00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.669 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. So so for ap gov, you have that 1st semester and then second semester. It's not an ap. 118 00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:27.189 huda: No second semester is okay. So 1st semester is ap gov, and then second semester is ap macro. 119 00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:34.220 Jenny Duan: Okay, is there a chance that you could drop Ap Macro second semester and do like a non ap class like just normal Econ. 120 00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.239 huda: Oh, I can't! That's a good idea. I think I can ask my counselor. 121 00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.169 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Because wouldn't that be? Wouldn't that be preferable? Like if you. 122 00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.080 huda: Yeah. 123 00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.520 Jenny Duan: That second sister. And then that's like, basically the equivalent of just not taking another Ap. 124 00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.530 huda: Yeah, I think that's better. Yeah. 125 00:15:55.504 --> 00:15:59.169 huda: I think that one's also like the harder one as well. I think I've heard. 126 00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.860 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, sounds sounds good. 127 00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.170 Jenny Duan: cause that could be like a good plan for you. 128 00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.650 huda: Yeah. 129 00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.220 Jenny Duan: Cool. Let's just do that. 130 00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.050 Jenny Duan: And then 131 00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.690 Jenny Duan: what else has been on your mind? Besides, the classes. 132 00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:33.380 huda: So like this weekend like on Tiktok, I posted like this video. It was, is it the 1st like Tiktok that I posted? That wasn't really like related to sinceory early technology. And it got like viral. I got like 250,000 views. 133 00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.210 Jenny Duan: A lot of followers. 134 00:16:36.656 --> 00:16:43.809 huda: Yeah, relatively like, I have like 84 now. And I think I started off at like at like 135 00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.649 huda: 52. So like I gained around like 30 followers from that, but. 136 00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:53.800 Jenny Duan: Only gain 30 followers that does not make sense to me. 137 00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:59.910 Jenny Duan: I would, I would imagine, more. But that's awesome. Wait, tell me about the video. 138 00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:10.490 huda: It was just about like I was talking about the frowny face, emoji, and like how I use it like in in a unconventional way, like I usually use it to like 139 00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:18.566 huda: when I'm like trying to do like a smiley face, cause like it like looks sad, but it and it kinda like I use it as like a happy face. I don't know. 140 00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.769 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, okay. Gotcha 141 00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:23.309 Jenny Duan: super cute. 142 00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.679 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait.

But then I'm also trying to like go back to like the tech niche, but, like those obviously don't get as many views. 146 00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.230 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 147 00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.060 Jenny Duan: I look, okay.

I'm so happy for you. 152 00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:17.689 Jenny Duan: and it looks like like it looks like all your videos have like gotten some pretty good 153 00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.099 Jenny Duan: good traction, you know, like you have a lot of videos that are like semi viral. 154 00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.529 huda: Yeah, I mean, like. 155 00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.320 huda: and some of them like 156 00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.260 huda: the ones that get viral, usually the ones that get like reposted. But like. 157 00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.749 huda: yeah, it's like hard to like, make videos about like synthure that people would repost. So like. 158 00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:50.229 huda: yeah, I've been like, I've been trying to like mix like advertising for some thorium and then also making content. But I think I I think I might just do like more casual content. Maybe if that like helps like gain, more like views, and like like attraction. 159 00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.960 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that works. I mean, I think you're doing a good job at the moment. 160 00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.490 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 161 00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.129 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think you're doing a great job. Great congrats. 162 00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.413 huda: Thank you. 163 00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.779 Jenny Duan: Anything else on your mind that's been new. 164 00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:17.820 huda: So I started working on the essay. I I couldn't really finish it, because I was kind of stuck. So I got to like the part where I like 165 00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.390 huda: So like I describe, like the character selection. And then I get to the part where it's like the Msa guys. And then I do the fight scene. 166 00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.029 huda: And then I also do like 167 00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:41.834 huda: like the reflection after that, like losing like a like losing health after that, and then and then I kinda don't know where to go from there, like I know that I want to do like one more problem. I think I was before. I was thinking of doing like 3 different problems, and then like 168 00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:57.699 huda: like starting over and trying something different. But then I feel like that might not be. That might be like too much for like just one essay, and also and also like, I feel like the starting over just doesn't really make sense in the context of like. 169 00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:22.490 huda: like, if the life is my game like, I didn't get to restart or anything. So then so then, like I was thinking we could, I could have like 2 different problems. And I'm like on my last life. And then I go and try like joining like the joining the national Muslim organization, and then also like starting, empowering. AI. But then, yeah. And then I was thinking about like, what you said earlier that like 170 00:20:22.926 --> 00:20:27.177 huda: not mentioning empowering AI too much because we could like write 171 00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:37.070 huda: like supplementals about that. So then that's also like kinda I kinda got stuck there. But then I just kinda stopped after the Msa. Part. 172 00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.990 huda: Yeah. 173 00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.540 Jenny Duan: You share your essay, or where is this? Where can I find it? 174 00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.761 huda: Oh, yeah, sorry I haven't. I wrote a draft. 175 00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.040 Jenny Duan: No worries. 176 00:20:48.528 --> 00:20:50.080 huda: I just shared it with you. 177 00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.659 Jenny Duan: Okay. Can you send me the link in the zoom chat. 178 00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:54.860 huda: Yes. 179 00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.300 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 180 00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.080 Jenny Duan: Okay, I just got there. 181 00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.430 Jenny Duan: Let's make it into present tense. 182 00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.710 Jenny Duan: I have 183 00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.880 Jenny Duan: oops once again. 184 00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.509 Jenny Duan: I have 3 hearts hovering over me 3 chances to survive. 185 00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.290 Jenny Duan: He spawned into the endless realm 186 00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.930 Jenny Duan: face with a task. Okay, I feel like this is not exactly a task. 187 00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.860 Jenny Duan: But 188 00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.259 Jenny Duan: this is okay. For now. 189 00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.649 Jenny Duan: Okay, I I love this. I love this like this format. This is so int, like. 190 00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.895 Jenny Duan: this is so interesting and written really, well, 191 00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:00.890 huda: Jacob. 192 00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.299 Jenny Duan: I think let's do more world building 193 00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.560 Jenny Duan: like 194 00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.450 Jenny Duan: before, like. 195 00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.129 Jenny Duan: But here, Upper in the other essay, we wrote about like 196 00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:32.640 Jenny Duan: paralleling your life to like animal crossing. I think we could add some more world building in the in the beginning, because it's kind of like you start your 1st task, but it's like the 1st thing that you notice about a game is what the characters look like, where they are in the world and like what their universe looks like. And I feel like here, you know, we're like in the game, but like 197 00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.710 Jenny Duan: it's a bit 198 00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.475 Jenny Duan: like unclear. What you're 199 00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.670 Jenny Duan: what your goal is, you know. 200 00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:51.700 Jenny Duan: and what your characters doing. So this isn't like. I think this join the Msa. Seems a little bit disjointed at the moment, because I'm not really sure like 201 00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.249 Jenny Duan: in what context it fits. 202 00:22:56.729 --> 00:23:03.639 huda: I have, like the essay from like the Brian Cameron essay. I think it was like the one about like 203 00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.559 huda: the location in Study Valley. 204 00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.380 huda: let me paste at the bottom. 205 00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.520 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 206 00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.240 Jenny Duan: okay. 207 00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.150 Jenny Duan: I also feel like, maybe we can like. 208 00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.159 Jenny Duan: I love this like these questions here. 209 00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.470 Jenny Duan: what is? And in this game like, what does it mean to win 210 00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.010 Jenny Duan: like what is what is like completing the game, or like, what does beating the game look like. 211 00:24:35.565 --> 00:24:37.689 huda: I was thinking, maybe like 212 00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.880 huda: experience, like having like a high experience points like maybe like 213 00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:51.039 huda: like, for example, if you like win a battle instead of like losing heart to like gaining experience. And 214 00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:56.299 huda: maybe like in the game. There's a good total map that you're supposed to reach like 215 00:24:57.375 --> 00:25:11.089 huda: like, for example, like if there's like 3 battles, they have to fight like the like. The total experience that you're supposed to earn is 300, and then each time you win a battle you get like 100 xb. That would kind of make sense. 216 00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.649 Jenny Duan: Okay, so like, what is this? But what is I still understand? Like, what is this? Characters? 217 00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.830 Jenny Duan: Main goal? 218 00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.179 Jenny Duan: Because, like in every 219 00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:31.130 Jenny Duan: game like there's an objective besides, just like gaining xp. What what does gaining Xp mean to this character? 220 00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.509 huda: Not really sure, like 221 00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.719 huda: I was like. 222 00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:49.969 huda: like, I didn't really know like, how like, what type of like game to like base this off of like. I thought I was thinking kind. I was kind of basing this off of like pokemon, and like like the older pokemon games 223 00:25:50.334 --> 00:25:54.469 huda: like I have to like go into like kind of fight, different 224 00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:55.790 huda: characters. 225 00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.010 huda: and like 226 00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:04.980 huda: I guess, like be like the best, like pokemon trainer, but like and kind of converting it to like this context 227 00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.860 huda: by saying, like, you have to like, fight all these battles like. 228 00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:20.169 huda: like, for example, on this one, like the reason why, like, I'm supposed to be like getting like an Msa like leadership is because, like, I wanna like, bring like the Muslim girl experience. And like, let those like girls in 229 00:26:20.652 --> 00:26:23.390 huda: they're like waiting outside of the Msa building. 230 00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.529 huda: But like, yeah, like, I understand it, just it kind of doesn't make sense as a game. But 231 00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.130 huda: yeah. 232 00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:49.409 Jenny Duan: Okay, so let's let's 1st define, like, I guess these constraints of the game. So in normal Rpgs, what is the main like? There's always a characters quest right like what the character is trying to do and where they're trying to go. So in this game, what is your characters? Quest per se. 233 00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.080 huda: like 234 00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.710 huda: like Quest, like their end goal is that we're trying to ask. 235 00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.989 Jenny Duan: Exactly. Yeah. 236 00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.746 huda: Maybe like 237 00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.340 huda: like 238 00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:27.719 huda: Maybe like. So, for example, like as I wrote like, there's like the like, the line of girls who are able to be like getting in. So like, maybe like go and like help, like some of the other end. Pcs, like, we're like 239 00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:40.000 huda: like having problems and kind of stand up for them. Maybe like that could be like the goal. There would be like different instances where, like the character has to like, stand up for the other Npcs. 240 00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.380 Jenny Duan: Okay. 241 00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.890 Jenny Duan: arms. 242 00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.780 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. 243 00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:57.240 Jenny Duan: I'm I'm wondering. So for your empowering AI essay like our centuria essay. If we eventually wrote a piece about centuria like. 244 00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.749 Jenny Duan: what would that look like, or what would you want that to look like. 245 00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:04.660 huda: Wait. Which I said. 246 00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.862 Jenny Duan: Like if we were to write an essay like hypothetically about 247 00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:15.179 Jenny Duan: Cynthoria like, how would you structure that essay? Because I'm wondering like. 248 00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:23.439 Jenny Duan: how does it make sense to structure this essay in the context of a game? And are you thinking about writing your other one like a game? Or how is that going to go. 249 00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.780 huda: I think about centuria like 250 00:28:32.284 --> 00:28:44.310 huda: I think like, especially like on my website, I also talked about how like the characters like represent like not just like me and my sister, but like also like me and my younger self 251 00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:55.110 huda: cause there's like like you asked me like the older sister. She's like helping like the young girl Sana, like learn how to like, learn about AI and stuff. And I feel like 252 00:28:55.190 --> 00:29:03.449 huda: that's kind of like the relationship with, like the game developer, which is like me, and like the other young girls using it. So maybe I'd like read about like 253 00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.259 huda: kind of like a parallel story of like. 254 00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:17.699 huda: Oh, I think you know, be interesting, like, maybe, like a parallel story of like empowering AI and like synthoria. I don't know if that's too much, but I feel like it. It's kind of similar, like in terms of like 255 00:29:18.276 --> 00:29:21.480 huda: they're like goals and stuff, and like the characters. 256 00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.860 huda: So I think that would be interesting, if not like, with parallel to empowering AI just like a random, like story about like 257 00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:33.930 huda: like teaching like teaching like a young girl how to code. Maybe. 258 00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.478 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. 259 00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:43.119 Jenny Duan: okay, so let's like, kind of talk through again, like the the 260 00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.560 Jenny Duan: the Rpg, here. So 261 00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.489 Jenny Duan: rpg, game, like. 262 00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:51.679 Jenny Duan: what is the mission or the end goal is to 263 00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.450 Jenny Duan: is to what 264 00:29:55.130 --> 00:30:12.000 Jenny Duan: I guess. That's like the main question, what is this character trying to to achieve. And this character is you like, maybe we can position this creating some type of impact on the world. So like you get, you are obviously trying to create impact on the world. What is the type of impact that you hope to have in like our world? 265 00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.710 huda: I think, like 266 00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.390 huda: teaching people without like 267 00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.470 huda: teaching people that don't have 268 00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:27.289 huda: like resources, things like for free and stuff, and then kind of like allowing skill building. Maybe I think that's like 269 00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.869 huda: my goal that I want to have on people. 270 00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.439 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's awesome. Can you 271 00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.459 Jenny Duan: like what does? And what does that look like in a character 272 00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.940 Jenny Duan: like, what would that look like for a character to have that goal. 273 00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.850 huda: Maybe, like 274 00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.839 huda: I think, in terms of like a game 275 00:30:46.890 --> 00:31:01.690 huda: I don't know. I don't know. Like usually like main characters like the protagonist of games like don't really do this, but like it could be like a training scenes and like like on those like type of mini games. Where, like someone's like teaching you something. 276 00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.970 huda: but 277 00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.120 huda: like but. 278 00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.340 Jenny Duan: Yeah. But what is that? What did those late lead to in the long term. 279 00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:11.935 huda: Oh, 280 00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.009 huda: We have a bit confused on the question. 281 00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:22.050 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, so like, it's a series of mini games, you said. But like, what does that like? What is that 282 00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.529 Jenny Duan: mean for that character. In the long term. 283 00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.729 huda: Yeah, I think, like. 284 00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.000 huda: like. 285 00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:39.670 huda: I'm not really sure, like, like help, like training like other like Npcs to like, I don't know. Like fight their own kind of like 286 00:31:40.503 --> 00:31:58.339 huda: battle, I guess like. For example, there could be like an Npc. Who like, has like a battle against a robot or something, and they need to learn like AI. Then like then, like the main character could kinda like help with that, and like train them and stuff. 287 00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.610 huda: or there could be like someone who like really needs to like train for like 288 00:32:05.153 --> 00:32:06.400 huda: maybe like 289 00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.730 huda: learning about Islam, and then then I'd be able to like 290 00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.980 huda: train them with like Sunday school and stuff like that. I feel like that's kind of where I'm going with 291 00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.620 huda: like the training aspect. 292 00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.060 Jenny Duan: Okay, I I still feel like. 293 00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.590 Jenny Duan: like, would you play this game if it didn't have an end goal? 294 00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:36.119 huda: I I just I don't really know like how to like, make my life into a game. It's kind of my struggle here. 295 00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:41.629 Jenny Duan: Your life. What is your main goal after you get into college? What do you hope to do? 296 00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.449 Jenny Duan: Cause college is not the end right. College is the beginning of your new life. 297 00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:52.740 Jenny Duan: So let's like, forget about the game. Let's just talk about your life like after college. What does your dream, life, look like 298 00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.220 Jenny Duan: Nick. 299 00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.989 huda: Like, honestly, but like we like getting a job 300 00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:09.369 huda: and maybe like continuing to like teach people. I feel like I'm pretty passionate about that. And I still want to do that in college. And 301 00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.539 huda: like, I guess. 302 00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.790 huda: yeah. So having like a job 303 00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.789 huda: and teaching, people are like what I wanted to after. 304 00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:30.809 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I think that like teaching is a great thing. So maybe your characters goal can be like to try to spread as much knowledge as possible, or to try to like 305 00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.060 Jenny Duan: accumulate knowledge, to like share to other people. 306 00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.399 Jenny Duan: That can be your character's goal, kind of like. 307 00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:43.539 Jenny Duan: I mean, I don't know if there's a game with a similar parallel to that. But like. 308 00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.220 Jenny Duan: I don't know your your character could be like some trying to. 309 00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.139 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, gain as much knowledge as possible, or like. 310 00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.259 Jenny Duan: use that knowledge to like. 311 00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:01.160 Jenny Duan: I don't know, change other people, or to affect other people, and that could be like 312 00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.990 Jenny Duan: what you do quests for, to like. 313 00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.380 Jenny Duan: gain new knowledge. 314 00:34:08.259 --> 00:34:20.430 huda: And like writing the essay, I'm not sure how like signified that it's a video game cause, like a lot of like the essays like narration, and it just kind of sounds like this stuff is happening in their life, for like 315 00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:24.760 huda: and like, I don't know how to make it sound less like. 316 00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.720 huda: I don't know, like Corny, almost because I feel like I'm just like kind of saying a lot of stuff and not really showing. 317 00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:37.079 huda: I'm like I'm trying to, but I'm not really sure how to like change that. 318 00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.120 Jenny Duan: Can you tell me more. 319 00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.620 huda: Yeah. So like, for example, I don't like. 320 00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:59.089 huda: I feel like the hook it kind of like introduces that. It's a game. But then, like. I'm not sure if it kind of signifies that it's like in a game, you know, like people might be kind of confused cause when I was like reading it to my mom. She's a bit confused@firstst 321 00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:02.149 huda: She understood a little bit. But 322 00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:03.440 huda: yeah. 323 00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.850 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 324 00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.900 Jenny Duan: see? 325 00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.290 Jenny Duan: I think it's because there's no like world building in the beginning. 326 00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:30.499 huda: yeah, like, I just, I don't know like what I'm supposed to be describing, because it's like, I've never like written a game like about the video game before, like a story about like a video game before. So like, I'm not really sure how to 327 00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.820 huda: introduce like. But it's a video game. 328 00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.560 Jenny Duan: Okay. 329 00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.350 Jenny Duan: see it. 330 00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.010 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like the 3, 331 00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.830 Jenny Duan: you have 3 hearts. 332 00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:04.659 Jenny Duan: This is like, maybe instead of this being like the video game, you could be like, you're like. 333 00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.949 Jenny Duan: in some type of like battle, or like to to advance the next level 334 00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.959 Jenny Duan: like cause you're going to college, and college will be the next level, so 335 00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.669 Jenny Duan: we could turn it, instead of like looking at the game as a whole, to just like one small battle within the game. 336 00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:35.829 Jenny Duan: And it's like, what are the current challenges at this phase of your life to like? Move on to the next phase, and like the levels, could just be like each stage of your life that way. We don't have to set up like a fancy quest. We could just be like, you're just trying to get to like the next stage of life without, like some broader, deeper meaning. 337 00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.140 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 338 00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.280 Jenny Duan: What do you think about that? Is that slightly easier to conceptualize. 339 00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:50.558 huda: Yeah, I feel like, that's a lot easier than like, like, kind of the concept, like the whole game that's like has like a lot of things you have to like define. So maybe. 340 00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.960 Jenny Duan: And I won't take too much distraction away from you right. 341 00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.900 huda: Yeah. 342 00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.583 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 343 00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:05.540 Jenny Duan: let's see. 344 00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.000 Jenny Duan: So I think in the beginning, then you could talk about like 345 00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.920 Jenny Duan: I think, this customizing your appearance. 346 00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.090 Jenny Duan: It's not exactly a task. 347 00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.640 Jenny Duan: Facebook, like. 348 00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.729 Jenny Duan: customize my 349 00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.670 Jenny Duan: avatar in preparation for like 350 00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.849 Jenny Duan: this, next like 351 00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:41.150 Jenny Duan: this next level, or like this battle, or something like you don't have to say customizing it for the game like you can just put everything in the context of like one specific level or one like 352 00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.810 Jenny Duan: I don't know iteration of your life in in the context of the game. 353 00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:47.570 Jenny Duan: and then. 354 00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.820 Jenny Duan: with my character ready, I press, start, quest. 355 00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.379 Jenny Duan: Am I? 1st 356 00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.750 Jenny Duan: mission appears? 357 00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:11.914 huda: With. So so okay, just to clarify, I'm gonna be writing this like as if I'm the character in the game, or if I'm like playing a game like of my life. 358 00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:19.110 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think that both would be good, but I I think that it's nice if 359 00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.115 Jenny Duan: your 360 00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.760 Jenny Duan: if you're there in it. 361 00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.770 huda: Okay, so like. 362 00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:29.440 huda: home. 363 00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.080 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's early! 364 00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.010 huda: It's all this like, start quest stuff, right? 365 00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.040 Jenny Duan: I think the start way. 366 00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.789 Jenny Duan: Do you want to be the player of the game, or do you want to be the character of the game? 367 00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.953 huda: And that's like I was a I was a bit confused about, but 368 00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:54.469 huda: I feel like it would be more like action packed if it's like, if I'm like the character in the game. 369 00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.050 huda: and like. 370 00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.709 huda: yeah, like, I'm I'm not really sure how to like write this. 371 00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.820 Jenny Duan: Okay. 372 00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:28.090 Jenny Duan: wait. I'm not sure how I feel about like this positioning of the story, because it seems like you have like 3 hearts to survive and like you're trying to get knocked and like you're getting knocked out every time. 373 00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.290 Jenny Duan: which makes me feel like it's like 374 00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.629 Jenny Duan: more negative than positive, because you keep on getting like knocked out. 375 00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:56.600 huda: Yeah, what I was going for was like, I'm getting like knocked out by like like these challenges like Msa and stuff. But then but then, like I go and like go to other experiences, like, for example, like the Myna and then like joining that, and then that like helps that like gives me help. So it's kind of like 376 00:39:57.265 --> 00:40:01.990 huda: I guess, like finding solutions, for like the problems that like knocked me down before. 377 00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.940 Jenny Duan: okay. 378 00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.820 Jenny Duan: let's see. 379 00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.780 Jenny Duan: I think we're getting a little bit lost in this. 380 00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.125 huda: Yeah. 381 00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.499 Jenny Duan: I feel like this requires a lot of world building. 382 00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.730 Jenny Duan: but it seems challenging. Given the shortcount. 383 00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:30.369 huda: Is it possible if we could like brainstorm, maybe like a different essay idea? Because I feel like this, one has like a lot of like 384 00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.410 huda: like 385 00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.249 huda: do I write as a player is like or as like the character. And then there's also like. 386 00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:46.449 huda: I don't know, a lot of like aspects to it, cause it's like, not a game that already exists. So it's like you have to define a whole game, and it might not make sense to the reader. 387 00:40:47.590 --> 00:41:08.090 Jenny Duan: Wait. Maybe we pause on this, which is okay in the moment given that, like, there will be a lot of opportunities for you to use parts of this essay for another essay, and then we can always come back to it later if we need to. But I think maybe the best thing would just be like, pause here and try a different start. And also this is like really common with call with college app essays, like, I think I wrote like. 388 00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:13.790 Jenny Duan: I don't even know a lot of different drafts before getting like the essay that I wanted. 389 00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:23.050 Jenny Duan: okay, let's maybe come to a different theme, and then we can come back to this idea if if something new comes up, or if we like. 390 00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.217 Jenny Duan: I don't know 391 00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.039 Jenny Duan: decide to come back to it. 392 00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:39.969 Jenny Duan: Okay? Also, I think if you're writing like a video type, video game type of essay for also my video freezing, it's like freezing a lot on my end, but I don't know if it's working fine. 393 00:41:40.312 --> 00:41:41.340 huda: No, it's not. 394 00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.819 huda: It's fine. Okay. 395 00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:53.830 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. I think that if we're already gonna be writing like a video game type of essay for the centuria essay, maybe we can structure your common app in a different way. 396 00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.924 huda: Wait for this in 3. I say, 397 00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.238 huda: Where would that like? Is that like a supplemental or 398 00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.269 Jenny Duan: That'd be a supplemental. Yeah. 399 00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.370 huda: Okay. 400 00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.810 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 401 00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:21.589 Jenny Duan: what other experience experiences, do you think have shaped you into who you are? What like objects, moments, or things have shaped you into who you are. 402 00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.100 huda: like. 403 00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.470 huda: okay? I think. 404 00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.780 huda: trying to think. But like 405 00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:57.409 huda: maybe like when I was younger, like, maybe like in middle school, I had like a lot of online friends. 406 00:42:57.842 --> 00:43:02.379 huda: and that kind of like had gave me like a lot of exposure to like 407 00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:08.562 huda: like different perspectives like we we kind of just like played like minecraft and stuff. But 408 00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:16.009 huda: like, I got to like definitely gain like new perspectives from people like all around the world. 409 00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.200 huda: and that was pretty formative. 410 00:43:19.122 --> 00:43:21.349 huda: And I think 411 00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.439 huda: but I feel like that's not really something like interesting enough to write about. 412 00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:26.570 huda: But 413 00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.630 Jenny Duan: What else do you feel like? Has shaped you as a person. 414 00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:40.739 huda: What do you do? You have like any like kind of examples of like 415 00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.220 huda: like an Essie, that someone might write like cause I I'm kind of 416 00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.750 huda: having trouble like thinking of, like specifically what 417 00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.740 huda: I might have like a story. 418 00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:52.880 huda: both. 419 00:43:53.900 --> 00:44:18.519 Jenny Duan: So for me, like the essay that I wrote was about the 1st time I held a brain, and I use that to connect to like, how I'm interested in what makes people human and what like brings people together cause like, I think, at the end of the day, like all of our brains are pretty much the same, or like look pretty much the same. But like there's so much individuality in each one of our experiences, and that's like what motivates me to be like a cognitive science major, and to think about 420 00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:24.920 Jenny Duan: like the way that people are and why they are the way they are, which are like the questions I think about every day. 421 00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:33.629 Jenny Duan: But for you, since you're interested in, like the intersection of you know, design technology, ethics, gaming film and media. 422 00:44:34.094 --> 00:44:37.550 Jenny Duan: Maybe there's like some object or some example that 423 00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.850 Jenny Duan: I guess, connects to. 424 00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah how you are or why you are the way you are. 425 00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.330 Jenny Duan: But let me think. 426 00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.000 Jenny Duan: Arms. 427 00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.849 huda: I feel like, maybe. 428 00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:36.840 huda: okay, this one's like, kind of going back into like game development. But like, maybe like this software was called Unity, and that's kind of like where I did a lot of like the script writing and like like story writing for centuria. But I also did a lot of the code, and also did a lot of the art, and like everything on that. And that was like kind of a really big 429 00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.110 huda: software that I use. But I think. 430 00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.410 huda: yeah, I don't know if that's like, really like. 431 00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.958 huda: like, kind of poetic enough. 432 00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:48.499 Jenny Duan: I I'm thinking about something that you could write about, like. 433 00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.480 Jenny Duan: how different words have, like. 434 00:45:52.030 --> 00:46:04.769 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me try to elucidate this in the clearest way that I can like. How different. Okay, so the the theme is like trying to draw the power of like storytelling words language together. And so you could write something about how like. 435 00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:13.760 Jenny Duan: okay, unity is is a word that means different things. Right? It's first, st it's a computer sign like, it's a computer programming thing that like 436 00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:26.475 Jenny Duan: allows you to create games and create new world unity is also a SIM synonym for like peace or togetherness, which is like what you strive to to do, and like your advocacy, including like folklift, and like 437 00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:36.420 Jenny Duan: the Muslim like mosque thing, etc, etc, etc. So you could talk about like the power of like storytelling languages and words, and like you could use that to connect 438 00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:39.060 Jenny Duan: for example, like 439 00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:43.077 Jenny Duan: speaking different languages and beyond English or 440 00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:50.639 Jenny Duan: you could use that to connect, like you knowing computer science languages, and how those also enable you to like build new worlds. 441 00:46:50.690 --> 00:47:08.320 Jenny Duan: And but so I think, like something along that, like fuzzy realm of like languages, storytelling connection, and like connecting that to like computer science languages like your advocacy, the stories that you tell through folklift, through jcamp, etc, etc, etc, and like finding a way to piece all of that together. 442 00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:14.819 Jenny Duan: as like the main theme, I think that's something. But let me think about how to best structure that. 443 00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:27.065 huda: Okay, it could. I was thinking, like, maybe I could be like, unity takes many different forms. Unity is the software where I made my 1st game. Unity is 444 00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:34.230 huda: the like the communion of my Muslim community on Fridays, when we go to pray and then 445 00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.520 huda: sorry. What did he say? 446 00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.410 Jenny Duan: I said, that's amazing. Continue. 447 00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:43.309 huda: Thank you. And then like one more example, and then and then after that, I could be like. 448 00:47:44.138 --> 00:47:47.210 huda: unity is like 449 00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:52.899 huda: like. For example, I could also say, like unity is my! 450 00:47:53.640 --> 00:48:16.232 huda: Like the 4 languages I can speak all meaning the same thing at the end of the day, and then I can talk about like maybe, like like I could tell story through like through the coding languages that I know would like my games, and then I can talk about like how I can tell stories in English. Through like journalism. I can tell 451 00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.660 huda: I guess like stories through. 452 00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:33.549 huda: Okay, this one's a bit corny, but like like kindness, like supporting people. And that would be like also in like another language cause I, I see, like kindness, is kind of often seen as like a language. So I think. 453 00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.959 huda: like saying, like, this is universal, and that's what make languages like 454 00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.890 huda: unite, I guess. 455 00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.498 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. 456 00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.040 Jenny Duan: I think that that's that's awesome. I mean, that sounds really good to me. 457 00:48:50.260 --> 00:49:05.850 Jenny Duan: and I think that, like the piece about unity or the phrasing about unity, I think that can go in the middle like I don't. I think that's like something that should go in the middle of the essay. But I'm trying to figure out like how to connect the overarching theme together. I feel like 458 00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:07.900 Jenny Duan: starting off with that is not 459 00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:14.740 Jenny Duan: super compelling, like I think you could find a way to make the beginning like a little bit more interesting. But right now I'm 460 00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.160 Jenny Duan: thinking about the best 461 00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.680 Jenny Duan: way to start this. Say. 462 00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:32.360 Jenny Duan: yeah. 463 00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.570 Jenny Duan: who may think? 464 00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:44.870 Jenny Duan: So you're we're writing about language. What gives what gives words meaning computer science technology. 465 00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.310 Jenny Duan: cetera. 466 00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:54.539 Jenny Duan: like I could see like there's something in the be. There's like one paragraph in the beginning. And then it goes, or like couple of paragraphs, and it goes like. 467 00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.979 Jenny Duan: take the word unity, for example. 468 00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:03.048 Jenny Duan: and then goes into like what you just said, and then it goes into something else. After that like I see that is like the. 469 00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:14.709 huda: I think away. I thought of like an interesting idea, but I feel like I don't know if it W. Would work, but like so like, maybe, for like a hook, I can like write something in a language that I made up. 470 00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:23.640 huda: and then and then be like. This phrase means this, and then, I don't know. Okay, I feel like it might be like a bit confusing. But like 471 00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:35.499 huda: that's like kind of like talking about language like languages are just kind of like made up, but like they all like have the different meetings. That's kind of the whole thing that we're talking about 472 00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.999 huda: so I don't know. I feel like that would be an interesting hook, but I don't know if it makes sense like readers. 473 00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:51.280 Jenny Duan: I think that that could make sense. Tell me more about how you see that fitting in the context of the rest of your essay. 474 00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.490 huda: Like, for example, like, let me just. 475 00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.840 Jenny Duan: Are you typing in the doc? 476 00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.590 huda: Yeah. 477 00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.539 huda: no, I'm typing in the meeting chat. 478 00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:11.510 Jenny Duan: Okay. Okay. Cool. 479 00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:41.600 huda: Okay, wait. No. Actually thinking about this kind of sounds like, I don't think it would make sense like I don't know how to. I wouldn't be able to like articulate it well enough so that, like the person, will just be confused the whole time. So maybe like a different of good work. 480 00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.249 Jenny Duan: Wait. Did you send it into the chat? 481 00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:57.240 huda: Yeah, I don't. Okay. This is like the. This would be like the first, st like 2 sentences, and then. 482 00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:58.890 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, yeah. 483 00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.500 Jenny Duan: What is that? What is that? 484 00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.080 Jenny Duan: What language is that. 485 00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:05.490 huda: I just made it up. I'd be like 486 00:52:05.967 --> 00:52:14.879 huda: like languages are just something that like humans created on their own. But they but every language has the same meaning 487 00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.710 huda: and then, like. 488 00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:24.559 huda: I don't know. Maybe like, go into how like I'm able to use like different languages. To like 489 00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:28.150 huda: kind of do the same thing, which is like storytelling 490 00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:41.399 huda: and then, like, like, maybe like they use example later, like the paragraph about like unity, you'd be like, unity is just one word, but it's also takes many forms like game development. 491 00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:49.429 huda: like writing like that's kinda what I was thinking, but I don't know. I feel like this. This hook might not make sense. 492 00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:55.280 Jenny Duan: Hmm! I think that that makes sense. I'm wondering. 493 00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:04.109 Jenny Duan: Let me think of something else we could do. Let's okay. That's a good hook. Let me see if there's any other story you could bring into your life. 494 00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.129 Jenny Duan: You could. You could talk about how like 495 00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.520 Jenny Duan: another theme you could talk about is how like 496 00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:51.690 Jenny Duan: human connection evolves from the way that we communicate with one another in various forms, whether that's like 3 texting bubbles on a screen like handwritten letters by line in a news article, like something regardless of what it is like. There's different ways that we can signal our attention to other people. 497 00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:57.590 Jenny Duan: and like in a world where, like, there's so many things that draw our attention away like sometimes. 498 00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:58.860 Jenny Duan: like 499 00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.450 Jenny Duan: the time it takes to read, one sentence is like very precious and valuable 500 00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:12.359 Jenny Duan: in like the broad scheme of things. But like, that's all like sort of the Meta analysis of the essay. But I'm like trying to focus on like how to get. 501 00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:22.140 Jenny Duan: I think the 1st part will be like kind of hard, because once you start into the like reflection aspect of it. I think there's like a lot to to pull out here. But like 502 00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:26.770 Jenny Duan: I'm wondering what's the best way you can capture someone's attention like right away. 503 00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:59.859 Jenny Duan: You remember what your 1st word was, or do you know? Didn't do? No, I guess you wouldn't remember. But like. 504 00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.719 huda: Yeah, I'll probably I'll I'll ask my parents. I don't know. 505 00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.300 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 506 00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.739 huda: Wait. Okay? And then I I edited like the In the chat I edited kind of like 507 00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.489 huda: what it would look like. So it'd be like 508 00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:35.400 huda: these random words, and I would be like, that means nice to meet you. I made that language 5 min ago, but it, interestingly enough, conveys the same meaning of a language made 5,000 years ago. 509 00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:51.890 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that seems good for now. Like, do you feel like, do you feel the source of information like, do you feel like you could just write this 510 00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.969 Jenny Duan: cause. I feel like sometimes like when you're thinking about an essay like it should feel a little bit natural like 511 00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.760 Jenny Duan: it should just flow. 512 00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.649 huda: Wait. How long is this essay supposed to be? Cause? I don't like 513 00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:03.935 huda: yeah. 514 00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:07.550 huda: How many words. 515 00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:08.860 Jenny Duan: 50. 516 00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:10.140 huda: 50. 517 00:56:10.442 --> 00:56:12.260 Jenny Duan: 6 50. It's not that much. 518 00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.160 huda: Like what? 519 00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:31.480 huda: Okay? I think I think I should probably be able to. But I feel like with this essay, like I could definitely talk a little bit like a lot about like my different storytelling, like the different languages and stuff. But would kind of like analyzing the like 520 00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:36.139 huda: like language. And it's kind of ability to 521 00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:48.530 huda: or like like, would it like analyzing like language and its ability to like be used in different like mediums and stuff. Would that be like drawing like the attention away from myself in the essay. 522 00:56:49.200 --> 00:57:10.739 Jenny Duan: I think you would put yourself in the essay by talking about like your programming or your journalism, or like how language is a conduit for storytelling, for human connection, for kind of people all around the world like you can change a language on tick, tock to like, go viral, you know stuff like that like that's all. Encompass under the broader theme of like language. 523 00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:12.189 Jenny Duan: or communicate. 524 00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.710 huda: I was thinking like. 525 00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:21.630 huda: could I talk about like, how like in like spoken languages, specifically like, maybe telling 526 00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:29.430 huda: like a story like my mom telling a story to me when I was younger like. And then that being like said in Hindi, and then, like. 527 00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.320 huda: I don't know or like. 528 00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:40.599 huda: or how about like my grandma telling a story to my mom in Hindi and then like, now she tells it to me in English, and like. 529 00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.109 huda: would that like 530 00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:50.391 huda: draw like, would that be about someone else, or like, I feel like that? That'd be like an interesting thing to talk about as well. But again I don't wanna like 531 00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.199 Jenny Duan: What would you be trying to convey with that. 532 00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.030 huda: Like the fact that 533 00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.340 huda: I guess like 534 00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:06.670 huda: like the same kind of thing that I meant, and like the the hook that, like like languages don't draw away from like what you can do like, for example, like 535 00:58:07.012 --> 00:58:17.910 huda: like my grandma tells the same story as like my mom does, and even those in like different languages. It's like, it's still like teaching the same morals. Still, kind of like entertaining the same. 536 00:58:18.602 --> 00:58:20.899 huda: Yeah, that's kind of what I'm. 537 00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.930 Jenny Duan: Are different. 538 00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:26.620 Jenny Duan: There are words in some languages that don't have direct translations and say like English. 539 00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:29.450 Jenny Duan: And that's also like kind of interesting, too. 540 00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:39.030 Jenny Duan: because language holds more, so much more than just meaning. It holds like generations of context and history that can't really be captured in direct translation. Sometimes. 541 00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.900 huda: Yeah, I guess. But like. 542 00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:48.530 huda: if the whole like essay is about like how like language has no barriers, and I think 543 00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.970 huda: it kind of makes sense that like 544 00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.809 huda: kind of don't really like focus on, like 545 00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.600 huda: the few words that can't be translated, because, like. 546 00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.440 huda: I feel like, if the whole essay is about that, then 547 00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:06.590 huda: it might not be like a good topic. If it's like, if if there's like some meaning that's lost. 548 00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:13.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, can you tell me a bit about how this essay would be structured? Then. 549 00:59:15.616 --> 00:59:17.750 huda: Yeah. So after this hook. 550 00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:24.209 huda: maybe I talk about like I, I technically know, like 5 languages. 551 00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:25.620 huda: And so 552 00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:29.639 huda: thank you. And so like I can be like 553 00:59:32.008 --> 00:59:36.689 huda: Like knowing 5 languages. Verbally, or like, I guess. 554 00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:39.349 huda: knowing 5 languages. 555 00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:47.660 huda: cause, I know, like more languages technically, if it's like based off of like coding and stuff. So that's like. And that's what we're gonna talk about later. 556 00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:49.230 huda: But like 557 00:59:51.570 --> 01:00:07.250 huda: maybe right after the hook I could talk about like I'm a speaker of many languages, whether it be, and then like name, like the verbal languages that I know, and then or and like the coding languages that I know I could be like. 558 01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.531 huda: I I'm able to. 559 01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:16.600 huda: I guess I I tell stories in every. 560 01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.510 huda: in every 561 01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:20.959 huda: tongue that I can speak. I think 562 01:00:22.515 --> 01:00:24.339 huda: and then I can like 563 01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:46.569 huda: thank you. And then I could, and then I could like, do like different paragraphs, kind of like on, like the main things that I do like. For example, I think one thing I really should focus on is like game development. And that's like a 1 way. I really like like to tell stories. But and then the next one could be about like English and like 564 01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.499 huda: using and like telling stories. 565 01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.910 huda: I think. Wait. Would it be fine to like mention folklift? Because, like, I feel like. 566 01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:05.619 huda: if I'm able to say that, like I'm promoting like stuff of my culture and like writing it, we're telling stories in English. I'm able to like portray it to people that only understand English 567 01:01:06.217 --> 01:01:09.430 huda: and that like breaks the barrier of language, like 568 01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.889 huda: the fact that, like 569 01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:14.469 huda: stories that would normally be told in like Hindi, to like. 570 01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:18.420 huda: break the barriers of language and be told to people that speak English. 571 01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:22.419 huda: So I think I could mention folklift there 572 01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:23.880 huda: and then. 573 01:01:24.656 --> 01:01:28.809 huda: After that I can maybe do like a like a paragraph about 574 01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.350 huda: maybe like filmmaking with like 575 01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:44.100 huda: photography and stuff. Cause that one's like a language that. 576 01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:53.980 huda: Well, okay, I think that kind of contradicts, like the topic of the essay. But, like visual language, should that like? Would that contradict it? Or 577 01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.970 huda: like, is photography fine. 578 01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:22.210 Jenny Duan: I think photography is fine. I think like language could be anything you want, because if the theme of the essay is like communication and storytelling. I don't think it has to be exactly like language like language could be interpreted super broadly. I think so. Photography could definitely count as a medium for communication. Just like, you know, language is a medium for communication. Journalism is a media medium for communication. So it's like Tiktok, even Youtube, even like game design. 579 01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.460 Jenny Duan: And obviously also photography. 580 01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:44.999 huda: Okay, then photography. And I don't know if like, I I was thinking, like, maybe like describing like one like a picture that I took which tells like, which is like, really like telling. Like, for example, I took. Okay, this is not really a good example, but like, for example, in London I like took a picture of like a guard, and then. 581 01:02:45.020 --> 01:03:04.229 huda: like the framing, showed it like the authority, and, like the people framed behind him like looked kind of like in awe. Slash like respectful but like this is not a good example, like I'll probably find like a better picture where I did storytelling. But yeah, and then I could like describe that. And like. 582 01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:09.869 huda: like a photographers like kind of thought process in telling stories through photography. 583 01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.129 huda: And then I think I could like wrap it up from there and be like 584 01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:17.389 huda: oh, well, actually like no, I think Anita mentioned Unity right? So I think 585 01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:20.870 huda: that could be like my concluding paragraph. Maybe, like 586 01:03:21.395 --> 01:03:38.000 huda: like the word unity is my game system, like the word unity is like the me volunteering, or like our Muslim community at the mosque. And then that could be like, maybe, like my concluding paragraph, or like right before. 587 01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:52.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then what is the contents of the essay? So like, what are you focusing within the inside of your essay? So starting off with talking about, like, you know the meaning of this of the story in in Hindi and English, right. 588 01:03:54.803 --> 01:03:55.569 Jenny Duan: And then. 589 01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.178 huda: I forgot about that. 590 01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:03.979 huda: I don't think I did. I don't think I mentioned that in like the overview. Where would I put that? I think. 591 01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.160 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! I thought you wanted to. I oh, sorry. Not the meeting like your mom telling you the story. 592 01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.190 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So. 593 01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.419 huda: Got to add that into the story, but I think it. 594 01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.770 huda: I think. 595 01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.790 huda: Do you think they'll like add to the story, or like detract from it. 596 01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:20.319 Jenny Duan: I feel like. 597 01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.530 Jenny Duan: how else would do you want to start it 598 01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.680 Jenny Duan: like. 599 01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.559 huda: I was just gonna talk about like 600 01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:41.730 huda: like being able to speak many languages and like like, it wasn't the like. The the brag points that really like made me love ha! Being able to speak so many languages. It was like the fact that I'd be able to like tell stories. 601 01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:44.989 huda: I guess this could be like a good way to like 602 01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.550 huda: good way to 603 01:04:47.420 --> 01:05:17.059 huda: Tell it. And also like, maybe if I wanted to talk about like the story that my that my grandma said to my mom, I could be like, my, my grandma's told my mom the story in Hindi, and my mom told that story to me in English and knowing like now, as like someone who can speak many languages. I'm able to like. I can like hear this story from, like my grandmother and my mother, and like and pass it on, and kind of 604 01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:22.669 huda: break the barriers of language. I think that could be it if I wanted to use the 605 01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.119 huda: story that my grandmother said. 606 01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.949 Jenny Duan: Okay, are there? Is there any other way you think you can start this cause? I feel like 607 01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:33.790 Jenny Duan: like that could work too. I'm just curious. If you have any other ideas. 608 01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.650 huda: Hmm! 609 01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:54.539 huda: Maybe like I could talk about like 610 01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.819 huda: how as like a shy person 611 01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:05.270 huda: it like it feels like, you know, like 0 languages, I guess but like when but like 612 01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:16.119 huda: like as my like identity like I know, like 5 different languages, and like, I know, all these like different languages, and so, like being our be able to like. Use them as like 613 01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:22.680 huda: like articulation to tell stories like, I think that's how I could go about it. 614 01:06:23.295 --> 01:06:23.890 huda: Maybe 615 01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:24.840 huda: like. 616 01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:35.730 huda: like, maybe like finding as like someone who feels like they have like 0 languages going to feel like they have like 5 plus languages after they tell stories. Maybe that could be like 617 01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.260 huda: a good way to start it. 618 01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:44.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, is there like a specific scene? You can put someone into the reader into. 619 01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:53.490 Jenny Duan: Avoid as much like pure description as possible, and try to put the reader even seen. 620 01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.590 huda: Could it be like? 621 01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:57.920 huda: Could it be like a scene where 622 01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:07.730 huda: like, I don't know, like just an instance of like me being like quiet or like shy, and then, like someone asked me, like. 623 01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:15.349 huda: are kind of like saying like, Oh, you know 0 languages. And then I can like, reflect on like. 624 01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:28.010 huda: did like? Do I really know 0 languages? I technically know? 5. But what's my like ability? What what are like the languages that I know without being able to tell stories with them. 625 01:07:28.856 --> 01:07:30.559 huda: That could be like 626 01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:33.160 huda: like a story like a setting that I could 627 01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.370 huda: say 628 01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:37.850 huda: I like dialogue. 629 01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.839 Jenny Duan: Cool. Sounds perfect. 630 01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:51.850 Jenny Duan: I think that's a good start. Why don't we try that? If you could just write like 631 01:07:52.590 --> 01:08:07.030 Jenny Duan: spend only like 2 h and just write like a really really bad 1st draft. And we should just check in on this next time we meet to see if it feels natural if we want to pivot again and like what you're thinking about this. I know we have a meeting set up on 632 01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.380 Jenny Duan: I. We have these have tomorrow. Do you think that's enough time for you to 633 01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:17.729 Jenny Duan: come back to this? Or do you wanna skip our meeting tomorrow and just do it on Tuesday? 634 01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:21.080 huda: Wait. What time will the meeting tomorrow be? 635 01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.279 Jenny Duan: Have it from 3 30 to 4 30 pst. 636 01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:28.649 huda: A, 637 01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:29.809 huda: I think. 638 01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:34.899 huda: Can I get back to you like maybe by tonight, like 639 01:08:35.049 --> 01:08:43.809 huda: I can like, ask my mom for going anywhere at that time, and as well cause if we're going then I'll be able to just like work on the essay in the morning. But 640 01:08:44.099 --> 01:08:46.299 huda: yeah, I'll let you know by like. 641 01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:49.689 huda: maybe like a couple like minutes after the call. 642 01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:54.539 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, no pressure at all. I think. Like as long as you're able to spend just like 643 01:08:54.599 --> 01:09:08.699 Jenny Duan: one to 2 h like, just don't spend a lot of time on this. Just start writing it to see if the structure and flow feels like good to you, and then we can discuss. If we want to like, continue workshopping this essay, or if you want to pivot to a different theme later on. 644 01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:09.330 huda: Okay. 645 01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:17.100 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is a good good idea so far I'm excited to see you write it. But like, how do you feel about it right now? 646 01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:25.829 huda: I feel like I definitely have, like a stronger foundation with this essay than the last one. So I I'm feeling a little more confident about like writing this. 647 01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:31.769 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you have any questions I can answer like anything you want to clarify before you get started drafting it. 648 01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:38.070 huda: Not at the moment. I think it makes sense right now. Yeah. 649 01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:44.669 Jenny Duan: Okay, feel free to text me if you have any questions, and then we'll either meet tomorrow or if not tomorrow. Then on Tuesday. 650 01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.830 huda: Okay. Great. 651 01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:48.739 Jenny Duan: Alright awesome bye. Take care! 652 01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.115 huda: Bye.",

Huda! How's it going. 6 00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.119 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 7 00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.700 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well. Yeah, any how was your weekend? Any updates. 8 00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:02.889 huda: It was really good, I think. I've been like a bit busy, especially there was like a lot of summer homework. I had to catch up on. I'm trying to finish it before I head off J camp. 9 00:06:03.282 --> 00:06:08.930 huda: And like I got my schedule back, some of it terrified for the next year, but. 10 00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.299 Jenny Duan: Oh, what's your schedule looking like? Why are you terrified. 11 00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.294 huda: It's like all my like father piece are back to back, and then 12 00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.440 Jenny Duan: Wow! 13 00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:21.169 huda: Yeah. And then it's like 14 00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.300 huda: no easy periods, basically. So I'm kind of scared. 15 00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.430 Jenny Duan: Well, 16 00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.100 Jenny Duan: Do you still feel confident everything that you are doing? Or do you have any like 17 00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.500 Jenny Duan: any classes or any specific things that you wanted to talk through. 18 00:06:39.520 --> 00:07:04.829 huda: Yeah, I was thinking, like, I was thinking of kind of switching out one of the Ap's cause. I don't know if I could handle like 5 Ap's in senior year, and cause there's also many other activities. And second semester I might not want to like. I might not be as motivated to do classwork. So I was thinking like of dropping, maybe ap psychology, which I think I just took it ",
    "because it's like an Ap. But. 19 00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.360 Jenny Duan: Maybe psych is like pretty easy, though. So I feel like that was not gonna not gonna be the one that. 20 00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.449 huda: Yeah, I think I just I wanted to like drop in like, maybe take like a class like ceramics or something like 21 00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.889 huda: something that's like 22 00:07:20.327 --> 00:07:21.610 huda: you know, more 23 00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.739 huda: like, I guess more fun. But yeah. 24 00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.279 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay? I think. 25 00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:35.309 Jenny Duan: okay, in terms of like college applications. I think if you drop a an Ap 26 00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.107 Jenny Duan: in like, it's gonna be harder to 27 00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.560 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's gonna be harder to go to like a top 5 school. But I also think that like 28 00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.740 Jenny Duan: it's up to you ultimately, because I think, like 29 00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.210 Jenny Duan: most people in their senior year at top schools like. 30 00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:07.510 Jenny Duan: I think, will take 6 or 7. So to be competitive. It's like very much. You kind of just have to get through 1st semester, because once you're done with 1st semester, you can be fine and like. 31 00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.960 Jenny Duan: just do second semester and chill out once you get into college. But I think it's like 32 00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:29.190 Jenny Duan: that's like the honest truth. But like it is also like a personal choice, because I know, like taking a lot of Ap's is not always the best idea, especially if you get worse grades in those. Ap. So I think it's a balance between like trying to get the most rigorous schedule as possible, while also like 33 00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.621 Jenny Duan: trying to balance getting good grades as well. 34 00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:45.970 Jenny Duan: So that's like the main thing. I do think that for ",
    "Stanford, if you're if you're still trying to apply Rea, I do think it's better for you to take 5 or even 6 Ap's. 35 00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.110 Jenny Duan: But 36 00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.770 Jenny Duan: that just depends on if you feel like you're gonna do well in those classes. 37 00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.959 Jenny Duan: But or not. 38 00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.389 Jenny Duan: because, yeah. 39 00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.589 huda: I don't know. I'm. 40 00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.650 Jenny Duan: Second semester grades don't really matter. 41 00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.400 huda: Yeah, I I don't know. I feel like 42 00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:21.410 huda: cause like in in our school, like second semester. You can't. You can't like drop it, or anything like you have to continue taking it, and then like, I don't know if I want to do that like I I'm fine with doing stuff 1st semester, which I know it might be hectic. But like, you know, it's like a lot of work. But yeah, like, I'm willing to put that in. But then I feel like second semester. I kind of wanna like. 43 00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.209 huda: have that more laid laid back. But 44 00:09:26.053 --> 00:09:33.029 huda: yeah, I'm still kind of thinking through it, and then, like, I think I'll like have to decide before August first, st and then. 45 00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.300 Jenny Duan: Oh, you have 3 days. 46 00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:34.629 huda: In, the. 47 00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.940 Jenny Duan: Side only. 48 00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:36.765 huda: Yeah. 49 00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.910 Jenny Duan: When did you get the schedule? Oh, no. 50 00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.610 huda: Like on Friday. 51 00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.580 Jenny Duan: Oh, shoot. Okay. 52 00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.539 Jenny Duan: So you basically only have, like, 5 days to decide. Okay. 53 00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.210 huda: Yeah. 54 00:09:51.854 --> 00:09:58.595 Jenny Duan: Okay. Well, I think the honest advice is that like to be competitive for Sta",
    "nford and other Iv leagues 55 00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.829 Jenny Duan: like Upen mit, etc. 56 00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.490 Jenny Duan: I think it's really important that if you want to be competitive to take as many a piece as possible. 57 00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:16.849 Jenny Duan: but if you don't care as much about those schools. Then it doesn't really matter. 58 00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.930 huda: Okay. 59 00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.589 huda: yeah, I think I feel like. 60 00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:32.970 huda: I think I'm just gonna keep it. And then, yeah, see if I could handle. And then, if if not, I can see if I can try and talking to like my counselor later on in the year. But like, I don't know if anything's possible. But like. 61 00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.590 huda: yeah, I think I'm just gonna stick with my my schedule. 62 00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:51.320 Jenny Duan: Okay. But I think as long as you do find the 1st semester, second semester doesn't really matter, because even if you get see, like once you get into, once you get accepted into a college like they probably are not gonna rescind you for any reason 63 00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.710 Jenny Duan: like regardless. So 64 00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:55.929 Jenny Duan: as long as. 65 00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.309 huda: For 1st semester. Are you supposed to be trying to get an a in all your classes as well. 66 00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.670 Jenny Duan: Yeah, because for regular decision, they look at your semester grades due in January. 67 00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.170 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 68 00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.630 Jenny Duan: So make sure that your Gp. Doesn't tank in your 1st semester. 69 00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:16.610 huda: Okay. Now, let's look a little bit more scary. 70 00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.010 huda: I mean. 71 00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:26.070 Jenny Duan: Okay for re restricted early action. Like, if you get in early action, then oh, it also doesn't matter. But if you 72 00:11:27.150 --> 00:11",
    ":28.905 Jenny Duan: if you do 73 00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:38.559 Jenny Duan: If you if you do apply regular decision for schools, then obviously, they're gonna check your your 1st semester grades. 74 00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.950 huda: Okay. 75 00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.090 Jenny Duan: Yeah. So what are you thinking right? Now? If anything. 76 00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.280 huda: I think like 77 00:11:49.880 --> 00:12:03.669 huda: I just like I don't know. Some of the classes are like hard like, I know ap lit like personally, like. I've seen people from my school. They say it's like one of the hardest Ap's, and so like I feel like that might like affect my Gva. 78 00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:10.549 huda: And then I know we're like, and I think I'm applying to like Stanford for regular decisions. So that's kind of like concerning. 79 00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.950 Jenny Duan: That, but. 80 00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.589 huda: Like, I mean, obviously. 81 00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.889 Jenny Duan: I think you said you were gonna do it for Rea. Is that still the case? 82 00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.549 huda: Oh, yeah, yeah, we're doing. I think I was doing Usc. And Stanford as well. 83 00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.189 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Usc. And Stanford for early action. 84 00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.100 huda: Okay, then, yeah. 85 00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:33.139 huda: okay, then, that's fine. Cause, like the other colleges, like, I obviously do like wanna apply to them. But I feel like 86 00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:44.400 huda: like, I mean, it's not guaranteed that I do bad in the classes, but even if, like, I'm not as like concerned as like with Stanford and Usc cause those are like kind of like my top 2 options 87 00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.500 huda: and and the Ucs as well. So I think 88 00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.690 huda: I think that should be fine. Then. 89 00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.580 Jenny Duan: Okay? Cause? Yeah, the Ucs are also like early. So they're not gonna see her 90 00:12:55.",
    "950 --> 00:12:58.550 Jenny Duan: for sister grade until 91 00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:10.149 Jenny Duan: I guess you have to send them or something. But okay, then, I think as long as you feel fine, then, as long as you know the the consequences, the pros and cons of both. 92 00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:17.030 Jenny Duan: Like, I guess. Yeah, as long as you're fully aware of what you're signing up for, then. Yeah, I think that's all that matters. 93 00:13:17.457 --> 00:13:23.360 Jenny Duan: Can you reiterate, which Ap's that you're taking again. So ap lit is one of them. What else. 94 00:13:24.354 --> 00:13:26.450 huda: Ap lit ap stats 95 00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.760 huda: ab gov and econ 96 00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:34.949 huda: and then I think that like counts as 2, and then ap Spanish and 97 00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.460 huda: a P. 98 00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.685 huda: Wait 99 00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.010 huda: We didn't mention all of them. I'm not sure. Wait 100 00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.940 huda: one second. Let me get my schedule. 101 00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.830 Jenny Duan: No problem. 102 00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.099 huda: Oh, sorry. Okay, basically, I have 103 00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.189 huda: ap lit ap stats ap Spanish ap Gov and ap psychology. 104 00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:18.420 huda: And then, like, outside of that, I have like a capstone computer science class, and like, just like a mandatory adulting class. 105 00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.210 Jenny Duan: What is a dilting class? I've never heard of that before. 106 00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.760 huda: It's like, basically like you could do like mock interviews. And then you get to like, learn about finances and stuff. It's just like 107 00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.460 huda: it's pretty interesting. 108 00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.010 huda: It's like a mandatory course for everyone in the grade. 109 00:14:35.367 --> 00:14:41.449 Jenny Duan: So you have a Cs capstone Api lit. What else? Again remind me, I'm writing ",
    "these down. 110 00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:49.570 huda: Yeah, so I have ap or I have a computer science capstone. I have ap lit. I have ap statistics 111 00:14:50.486 --> 00:14:51.940 huda: ap Spanish 112 00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.329 huda: and Ap. Gov. And Ap. Econ 113 00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.669 huda: and Ap. Psychology. 114 00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.629 Jenny Duan: Macroeconomics, or micro. 115 00:15:00.714 --> 00:15:09.509 huda: I think it's Macro. I'm not sure like right now on my schedule. It just says Gov. But in the second semester I'm taking like another phone class. 116 00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.690 huda: I think I'm pretty sure it's like early economics. 117 00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.669 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. So so for ap gov, you have that 1st semester and then second semester. It's not an ap. 118 00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:27.189 huda: No second semester is okay. So 1st semester is ap gov, and then second semester is ap macro. 119 00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:34.220 Jenny Duan: Okay, is there a chance that you could drop Ap Macro second semester and do like a non ap class like just normal Econ. 120 00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.239 huda: Oh, I can't! That's a good idea. I think I can ask my counselor. 121 00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.169 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Because wouldn't that be? Wouldn't that be preferable? Like if you. 122 00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.080 huda: Yeah. 123 00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.520 Jenny Duan: That second sister. And then that's like, basically the equivalent of just not taking another Ap. 124 00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.530 huda: Yeah, I think that's better. Yeah. 125 00:15:55.504 --> 00:15:59.169 huda: I think that one's also like the harder one as well. I think I've heard. 126 00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.860 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, sounds sounds good. 127 00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.170 Jenny Duan: cause that could be like a good plan for you. 128 00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.650 huda: Yeah. 129 00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.220 Jenny Duan: Cool. Let's just do th",
    "at. 130 00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.050 Jenny Duan: And then 131 00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.690 Jenny Duan: what else has been on your mind? Besides, the classes. 132 00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:33.380 huda: So like this weekend like on Tiktok, I posted like this video. It was, is it the 1st like Tiktok that I posted? That wasn't really like related to sinceory early technology. And it got like viral. I got like 250,000 views. 133 00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.210 Jenny Duan: A lot of followers. 134 00:16:36.656 --> 00:16:43.809 huda: Yeah, relatively like, I have like 84 now. And I think I started off at like at like 135 00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.649 huda: 52. So like I gained around like 30 followers from that, but. 136 00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:53.800 Jenny Duan: Only gain 30 followers that does not make sense to me. 137 00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:59.910 Jenny Duan: I would, I would imagine, more. But that's awesome. Wait, tell me about the video. 138 00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:10.490 huda: It was just about like I was talking about the frowny face, emoji, and like how I use it like in in a unconventional way, like I usually use it to like 139 00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:18.566 huda: when I'm like trying to do like a smiley face, cause like it like looks sad, but it and it kinda like I use it as like a happy face. I don't know. 140 00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.769 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, okay. Gotcha 141 00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:23.309 Jenny Duan: super cute. 142 00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.679 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait.

    "But then I'm also trying to like go back to like the tech niche, but, like those obviously don't get as many views. 146 00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.230 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 147 00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.060 Jenny Duan: I look, okay.

I'm so happy for you. 152 00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:17.689 Jenny Duan: and it looks like like it looks like all your videos have like gotten some pretty good 153 00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.099 Jenny Duan: good traction, you know, like you have a lot of videos that are like semi viral. 154 00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.529 huda: Yeah, I mean, like. 155 00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.320 huda: and some of them like 156 00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.260 huda: the ones that get viral, usually the ones that get like reposted. But like. 157 00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.749 huda: yeah, it's like hard to like, make videos about like synthure that people would repost. So like. 158 00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:50.229 huda: yeah, I've been like, I've been trying to like mix like advertising for some thorium and then also making content. But I think I I think I might just do like more casual content. Maybe if that like helps like gain, more like views, and like like attraction. 159 00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.960 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that works. I mean, I think you're doing a good job at the moment. 160 00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.490 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 161 00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.129 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think you're doing a great job.

    "on the essay. I I couldn't really finish it, because I was kind of stuck. So I got to like the part where I like 165 00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.390 huda: So like I describe, like the character selection. And then I get to the part where it's like the Msa guys. And then I do the fight scene. 166 00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.029 huda: And then I also do like 167 00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:41.834 huda: like the reflection after that, like losing like a like losing health after that, and then and then I kinda don't know where to go from there, like I know that I want to do like one more problem. I think I was before. I was thinking of doing like 3 different problems, and then like 168 00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:57.699 huda: like starting over and trying something different. But then I feel like that might not be. That might be like too much for like just one essay, and also and also like, I feel like the starting over just doesn't really make sense in the context of like. 169 00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:22.490 huda: like, if the life is my game like, I didn't get to restart or anything. So then so then, like I was thinking we could, I could have like 2 different problems. And I'm like on my last life. And then I go and try like joining like the joining the national Muslim organization, and then also like starting, empowering. AI. But then, yeah. And then I was thinking about like, what you said earlier that like 170 00:20:22.926 --> 00:20:27.177 huda: not mentioning empowering AI too much because we could like write 171 00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:37.070 huda: like supplementals about that. So then that's also like kinda I kinda got stuck there. But then I just kinda stopped after the Msa. Part. 172 00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.990 huda: Yeah. 173 00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.540 Jenny Duan: You share your essay, or where is this? Where can I find it? 174 00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.761 huda: Oh, yeah, sorry I haven't. I wrote a draft. 175 00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.040 Jenny Duan: No worries. 176 00",
    ":20:48.528 --> 00:20:50.080 huda: I just shared it with you. 177 00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.659 Jenny Duan: Okay. Can you send me the link in the zoom chat. 178 00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:54.860 huda: Yes. 179 00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.300 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 180 00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.080 Jenny Duan: Okay, I just got there. 181 00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.430 Jenny Duan: Let's make it into present tense. 182 00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.710 Jenny Duan: I have 183 00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.880 Jenny Duan: oops once again. 184 00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.509 Jenny Duan: I have 3 hearts hovering over me 3 chances to survive. 185 00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.290 Jenny Duan: He spawned into the endless realm 186 00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.930 Jenny Duan: face with a task. Okay, I feel like this is not exactly a task. 187 00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.860 Jenny Duan: But 188 00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.259 Jenny Duan: this is okay. For now. 189 00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.649 Jenny Duan: Okay, I I love this. I love this like this format. This is so int, like. 190 00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.895 Jenny Duan: this is so interesting and written really, well, 191 00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:00.890 huda: Jacob. 192 00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.299 Jenny Duan: I think let's do more world building 193 00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.560 Jenny Duan: like 194 00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.450 Jenny Duan: before, like. 195 00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.129 Jenny Duan: But here, Upper in the other essay, we wrote about like 196 00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:32.640 Jenny Duan: paralleling your life to like animal crossing. I think we could add some more world building in the in the beginning, because it's kind of like you start your 1st task, but it's like the 1st thing that you notice about a game is what the characters look like, where they are in the world and like what their universe looks like. And I feel like here, you know, we're like in the game, but like 197 00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.710 Jenny Duan: it's a bit 198 00:22:35",
    ".580 --> 00:22:37.475 Jenny Duan: like unclear. What you're 199 00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.670 Jenny Duan: what your goal is, you know. 200 00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:51.700 Jenny Duan: and what your characters doing. So this isn't like. I think this join the Msa. Seems a little bit disjointed at the moment, because I'm not really sure like 201 00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.249 Jenny Duan: in what context it fits. 202 00:22:56.729 --> 00:23:03.639 huda: I have, like the essay from like the Brian Cameron essay. I think it was like the one about like 203 00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.559 huda: the location in Study Valley. 204 00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.380 huda: let me paste at the bottom. 205 00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.520 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 206 00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.240 Jenny Duan: okay. 207 00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.150 Jenny Duan: I also feel like, maybe we can like. 208 00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.159 Jenny Duan: I love this like these questions here. 209 00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.470 Jenny Duan: what is? And in this game like, what does it mean to win 210 00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.010 Jenny Duan: like what is what is like completing the game, or like, what does beating the game look like. 211 00:24:35.565 --> 00:24:37.689 huda: I was thinking, maybe like 212 00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.880 huda: experience, like having like a high experience points like maybe like 213 00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:51.039 huda: like, for example, if you like win a battle instead of like losing heart to like gaining experience. And 214 00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:56.299 huda: maybe like in the game. There's a good total map that you're supposed to reach like 215 00:24:57.375 --> 00:25:11.089 huda: like, for example, like if there's like 3 battles, they have to fight like the like. The total experience that you're supposed to earn is 300, and then each time you win a battle you get like 100 xb. That would kind of make sense. 216 00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.649 Jenny Duan: Okay, so like, what is this? But what ",
    "is I still understand? Like, what is this? Characters? 217 00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.830 Jenny Duan: Main goal? 218 00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.179 Jenny Duan: Because, like in every 219 00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:31.130 Jenny Duan: game like there's an objective besides, just like gaining xp. What what does gaining Xp mean to this character? 220 00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.509 huda: Not really sure, like 221 00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.719 huda: I was like. 222 00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:49.969 huda: like, I didn't really know like, how like, what type of like game to like base this off of like. I thought I was thinking kind. I was kind of basing this off of like pokemon, and like like the older pokemon games 223 00:25:50.334 --> 00:25:54.469 huda: like I have to like go into like kind of fight, different 224 00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:55.790 huda: characters. 225 00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.010 huda: and like 226 00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:04.980 huda: I guess, like be like the best, like pokemon trainer, but like and kind of converting it to like this context 227 00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.860 huda: by saying, like, you have to like, fight all these battles like. 228 00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:20.169 huda: like, for example, on this one, like the reason why, like, I'm supposed to be like getting like an Msa like leadership is because, like, I wanna like, bring like the Muslim girl experience. And like, let those like girls in 229 00:26:20.652 --> 00:26:23.390 huda: they're like waiting outside of the Msa building. 230 00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.529 huda: But like, yeah, like, I understand it, just it kind of doesn't make sense as a game. But 231 00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.130 huda: yeah. 232 00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:49.409 Jenny Duan: Okay, so let's let's 1st define, like, I guess these constraints of the game. So in normal Rpgs, what is the main like? There's always a characters quest right like what the character is trying to do and where they're trying to go. So in this game, what is your cha",
    "racters? Quest per se. 233 00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.080 huda: like 234 00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.710 huda: like Quest, like their end goal is that we're trying to ask. 235 00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.989 Jenny Duan: Exactly. Yeah. 236 00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.746 huda: Maybe like 237 00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.340 huda: like 238 00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:27.719 huda: Maybe like. So, for example, like as I wrote like, there's like the like, the line of girls who are able to be like getting in. So like, maybe like go and like help, like some of the other end. Pcs, like, we're like 239 00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:40.000 huda: like having problems and kind of stand up for them. Maybe like that could be like the goal. There would be like different instances where, like the character has to like, stand up for the other Npcs. 240 00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.380 Jenny Duan: Okay. 241 00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.890 Jenny Duan: arms. 242 00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.780 Jenny Duan: That makes sense. 243 00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:57.240 Jenny Duan: I'm I'm wondering.

If we eventually wrote a piece about centuria like. 244 00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.749 Jenny Duan: what would that look like, or what would you want that to look like. 245 00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:04.660 huda: Wait. Which I said. 246 00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.862 Jenny Duan: Like if we were to write an essay like hypothetically about 247 00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:15.179 Jenny Duan: Cynthoria like, how would you structure that essay? Because I'm wondering like. 248 00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:23.439 Jenny Duan: how does it make sense to structure this essay in the context of a game? And are you thinking about writing your other one like a game? Or how is that going to go. 249 00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.780 huda: I think about centuria like 250 00:28:32.284 --> 00:28:44.310 huda: I think like, especially like on my website, I also talked about how like the characters like represent like no",
    "t just like me and my sister, but like also like me and my younger self 251 00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:55.110 huda: cause there's like like you asked me like the older sister. She's like helping like the young girl Sana, like learn how to like, learn about AI and stuff. And I feel like 252 00:28:55.190 --> 00:29:03.449 huda: that's kind of like the relationship with, like the game developer, which is like me, and like the other young girls using it. So maybe I'd like read about like 253 00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.259 huda: kind of like a parallel story of like. 254 00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:17.699 huda: Oh, I think you know, be interesting, like, maybe, like a parallel story of like empowering AI and like synthoria. I don't know if that's too much, but I feel like it. It's kind of similar, like in terms of like 255 00:29:18.276 --> 00:29:21.480 huda: they're like goals and stuff, and like the characters. 256 00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.860 huda: So I think that would be interesting, if not like, with parallel to empowering AI just like a random, like story about like 257 00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:33.930 huda: like teaching like teaching like a young girl how to code. Maybe. 258 00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.478 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. 259 00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:43.119 Jenny Duan: okay, so let's like, kind of talk through again, like the the 260 00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.560 Jenny Duan: the Rpg, here. So 261 00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.489 Jenny Duan: rpg, game, like. 262 00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:51.679 Jenny Duan: what is the mission or the end goal is to 263 00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.450 Jenny Duan: is to what 264 00:29:55.130 --> 00:30:12.000 Jenny Duan: I guess. That's like the main question, what is this character trying to to achieve. And this character is you like, maybe we can position this creating some type of impact on the world. So like you get, you are obviously trying to create impact on the world. What is the type of impact that you hope to have in like o",
    "ur world? 265 00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.710 huda: I think, like 266 00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.390 huda: teaching people without like 267 00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.470 huda: teaching people that don't have 268 00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:27.289 huda: like resources, things like for free and stuff, and then kind of like allowing skill building. Maybe I think that's like 269 00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.869 huda: my goal that I want to have on people. 270 00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.439 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's awesome. Can you 271 00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.459 Jenny Duan: like what does? And what does that look like in a character 272 00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.940 Jenny Duan: like, what would that look like for a character to have that goal. 273 00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.850 huda: Maybe, like 274 00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.839 huda: I think, in terms of like a game 275 00:30:46.890 --> 00:31:01.690 huda: I don't know. I don't know. Like usually like main characters like the protagonist of games like don't really do this, but like it could be like a training scenes and like like on those like type of mini games. Where, like someone's like teaching you something. 276 00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.970 huda: but 277 00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.120 huda: like but. 278 00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.340 Jenny Duan: Yeah. But what is that? What did those late lead to in the long term. 279 00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:11.935 huda: Oh, 280 00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.009 huda: We have a bit confused on the question. 281 00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:22.050 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, so like, it's a series of mini games, you said. But like, what does that like? What is that 282 00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.529 Jenny Duan: mean for that character. In the long term. 283 00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.729 huda: Yeah, I think, like. 284 00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.000 huda: like. 285 00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:39.670 huda: I'm not really sure, like, like help, like training like other like Npcs to like, I don't know. Like fight their ow",
    "n kind of like 286 00:31:40.503 --> 00:31:58.339 huda: battle, I guess like. For example, there could be like an Npc. Who like, has like a battle against a robot or something, and they need to learn like AI. Then like then, like the main character could kinda like help with that, and like train them and stuff. 287 00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.610 huda: or there could be like someone who like really needs to like train for like 288 00:32:05.153 --> 00:32:06.400 huda: maybe like 289 00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.730 huda: learning about Islam, and then then I'd be able to like 290 00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.980 huda: train them with like Sunday school and stuff like that. I feel like that's kind of where I'm going with 291 00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.620 huda: like the training aspect. 292 00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.060 Jenny Duan: Okay, I I still feel like. 293 00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.590 Jenny Duan: like, would you play this game if it didn't have an end goal? 294 00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:36.119 huda: I I just I don't really know like how to like, make my life into a game. It's kind of my struggle here. 295 00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:41.629 Jenny Duan: Your life. What is your main goal after you get into college? What do you hope to do? 296 00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.449 Jenny Duan: Cause college is not the end right. College is the beginning of your new life. 297 00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:52.740 Jenny Duan: So let's like, forget about the game. Let's just talk about your life like after college. What does your dream, life, look like 298 00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.220 Jenny Duan: Nick. 299 00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.989 huda: Like, honestly, but like we like getting a job 300 00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:09.369 huda: and maybe like continuing to like teach people. I feel like I'm pretty passionate about that. And I still want to do that in college. And 301 00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.539 huda: like, I guess. 302 00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.790 huda: yeah. So having like a job 303 00:33:15.830 -->",
    " 00:33:19.789 huda: and teaching, people are like what I wanted to after. 304 00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:30.809 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, I think that like teaching is a great thing. So maybe your characters goal can be like to try to spread as much knowledge as possible, or to try to like 305 00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.060 Jenny Duan: accumulate knowledge, to like share to other people. 306 00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.399 Jenny Duan: That can be your character's goal, kind of like. 307 00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:43.539 Jenny Duan: I mean, I don't know if there's a game with a similar parallel to that. But like. 308 00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.220 Jenny Duan: I don't know your your character could be like some trying to. 309 00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.139 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like, gain as much knowledge as possible, or like. 310 00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.259 Jenny Duan: use that knowledge to like. 311 00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:01.160 Jenny Duan: I don't know, change other people, or to affect other people, and that could be like 312 00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.990 Jenny Duan: what you do quests for, to like. 313 00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.380 Jenny Duan: gain new knowledge. 314 00:34:08.259 --> 00:34:20.430 huda: And like writing the essay, I'm not sure how like signified that it's a video game cause, like a lot of like the essays like narration, and it just kind of sounds like this stuff is happening in their life, for like 315 00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:24.760 huda: and like, I don't know how to make it sound less like. 316 00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.720 huda: I don't know, like Corny, almost because I feel like I'm just like kind of saying a lot of stuff and not really showing. 317 00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:37.079 huda: I'm like I'm trying to, but I'm not really sure how to like change that. 318 00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.120 Jenny Duan: Can you tell me more. 319 00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.620 huda: Yeah. So like, for example, I don't like. 320 00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:59.089 huda: I feel like the ho",
    "ok it kind of like introduces that. It's a game. But then, like. I'm not sure if it kind of signifies that it's like in a game, you know, like people might be kind of confused cause when I was like reading it to my mom. She's a bit confused@firstst 321 00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:02.149 huda: She understood a little bit. But 322 00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:03.440 huda: yeah. 323 00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.850 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 324 00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.900 Jenny Duan: see? 325 00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.290 Jenny Duan: I think it's because there's no like world building in the beginning. 326 00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:30.499 huda: yeah, like, I just, I don't know like what I'm supposed to be describing, because it's like, I've never like written a game like about the video game before, like a story about like a video game before. So like, I'm not really sure how to 327 00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.820 huda: introduce like. But it's a video game. 328 00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.560 Jenny Duan: Okay. 329 00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.350 Jenny Duan: see it. 330 00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.010 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like the 3, 331 00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.830 Jenny Duan: you have 3 hearts. 332 00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:04.659 Jenny Duan: This is like, maybe instead of this being like the video game, you could be like, you're like. 333 00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.949 Jenny Duan: in some type of like battle, or like to to advance the next level 334 00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.959 Jenny Duan: like cause you're going to college, and college will be the next level, so 335 00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.669 Jenny Duan: we could turn it, instead of like looking at the game as a whole, to just like one small battle within the game. 336 00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:35.829 Jenny Duan: And it's like, what are the current challenges at this phase of your life to like? Move on to the next phase, and like the levels, could just be like each stage of your life that way. We don't have to set up like a fancy quest. We could jus",
    "t be like, you're just trying to get to like the next stage of life without, like some broader, deeper meaning. 337 00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.140 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 338 00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.280 Jenny Duan: What do you think about that? Is that slightly easier to conceptualize. 339 00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:50.558 huda: Yeah, I feel like, that's a lot easier than like, like, kind of the concept, like the whole game that's like has like a lot of things you have to like define. So maybe. 340 00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.960 Jenny Duan: And I won't take too much distraction away from you right. 341 00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.900 huda: Yeah. 342 00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.583 Jenny Duan: Let's see. 343 00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:05.540 Jenny Duan: let's see. 344 00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.000 Jenny Duan: So I think in the beginning, then you could talk about like 345 00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.920 Jenny Duan: I think, this customizing your appearance. 346 00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.090 Jenny Duan: It's not exactly a task. 347 00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.640 Jenny Duan: Facebook, like. 348 00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.729 Jenny Duan: customize my 349 00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.670 Jenny Duan: avatar in preparation for like 350 00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.849 Jenny Duan: this, next like 351 00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:41.150 Jenny Duan: this next level, or like this battle, or something like you don't have to say customizing it for the game like you can just put everything in the context of like one specific level or one like 352 00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.810 Jenny Duan: I don't know iteration of your life in in the context of the game. 353 00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:47.570 Jenny Duan: and then. 354 00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.820 Jenny Duan: with my character ready, I press, start, quest. 355 00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.379 Jenny Duan: Am I? 1st 356 00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.750 Jenny Duan: mission appears? 357 00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:11.914 huda: With. So so okay, just to clarify, I'm gonna ",
    "be writing this like as if I'm the character in the game, or if I'm like playing a game like of my life. 358 00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:19.110 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think that both would be good, but I I think that it's nice if 359 00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.115 Jenny Duan: your 360 00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.760 Jenny Duan: if you're there in it. 361 00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.770 huda: Okay, so like. 362 00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:29.440 huda: home. 363 00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.080 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's early! 364 00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.010 huda: It's all this like, start quest stuff, right? 365 00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.040 Jenny Duan: I think the start way. 366 00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.789 Jenny Duan: Do you want to be the player of the game, or do you want to be the character of the game? 367 00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.953 huda: And that's like I was a I was a bit confused about, but 368 00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:54.469 huda: I feel like it would be more like action packed if it's like, if I'm like the character in the game. 369 00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.050 huda: and like. 370 00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.709 huda: yeah, like, I'm I'm not really sure how to like write this. 371 00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.820 Jenny Duan: Okay. 372 00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:28.090 Jenny Duan: wait. I'm not sure how I feel about like this positioning of the story, because it seems like you have like 3 hearts to survive and like you're trying to get knocked and like you're getting knocked out every time. 373 00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.290 Jenny Duan: which makes me feel like it's like 374 00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.629 Jenny Duan: more negative than positive, because you keep on getting like knocked out. 375 00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:56.600 huda: Yeah, what I was going for was like, I'm getting like knocked out by like like these challenges like Msa and stuff. But then but then, like I go and like go to other experiences, like, for example, like the Myna and then like joining that, and then that like helps ",
    "that like gives me help. So it's kind of like 376 00:39:57.265 --> 00:40:01.990 huda: I guess, like finding solutions, for like the problems that like knocked me down before. 377 00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.940 Jenny Duan: okay. 378 00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.820 Jenny Duan: let's see. 379 00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.780 Jenny Duan: I think we're getting a little bit lost in this. 380 00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.125 huda: Yeah. 381 00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.499 Jenny Duan: I feel like this requires a lot of world building. 382 00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.730 Jenny Duan: but it seems challenging. Given the shortcount. 383 00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:30.369 huda: Is it possible if we could like brainstorm, maybe like a different essay idea? Because I feel like this, one has like a lot of like 384 00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.410 huda: like 385 00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.249 huda: do I write as a player is like or as like the character. And then there's also like. 386 00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:46.449 huda: I don't know, a lot of like aspects to it, cause it's like, not a game that already exists. So it's like you have to define a whole game, and it might not make sense to the reader. 387 00:40:47.590 --> 00:41:08.090 Jenny Duan: Wait. Maybe we pause on this, which is okay in the moment given that, like, there will be a lot of opportunities for you to use parts of this essay for another essay, and then we can always come back to it later if we need to. But I think maybe the best thing would just be like, pause here and try a different start. And also this is like really common with call with college app essays, like, I think I wrote like. 388 00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:13.790 Jenny Duan: I don't even know a lot of different drafts before getting like the essay that I wanted. 389 00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:23.050 Jenny Duan: okay, let's maybe come to a different theme, and then we can come back to this idea if if something new comes up, or if we like. 390 00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.217 Jenny Duan: I ",
    "don't know 391 00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.039 Jenny Duan: decide to come back to it. 392 00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:39.969 Jenny Duan: Okay? Also, I think if you're writing like a video type, video game type of essay for also my video freezing, it's like freezing a lot on my end, but I don't know if it's working fine. 393 00:41:40.312 --> 00:41:41.340 huda: No, it's not. 394 00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.819 huda: It's fine. Okay. 395 00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:53.830 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. I think that if we're already gonna be writing like a video game type of essay for the centuria essay, maybe we can structure your common app in a different way. 396 00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.924 huda: Wait for this in 3. I say, 397 00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.238 huda: Where would that like? Is that like a supplemental or 398 00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.269 Jenny Duan: That'd be a supplemental. Yeah. 399 00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.370 huda: Okay. 400 00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.810 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 401 00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:21.589 Jenny Duan: what other experience experiences, do you think have shaped you into who you are? What like objects, moments, or things have shaped you into who you are. 402 00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.100 huda: like. 403 00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.470 huda: okay? I think. 404 00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.780 huda: trying to think. But like 405 00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:57.409 huda: maybe like when I was younger, like, maybe like in middle school, I had like a lot of online friends. 406 00:42:57.842 --> 00:43:02.379 huda: and that kind of like had gave me like a lot of exposure to like 407 00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:08.562 huda: like different perspectives like we we kind of just like played like minecraft and stuff. But 408 00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:16.009 huda: like, I got to like definitely gain like new perspectives from people like all around the world. 409 00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.200 huda: and that was pretty formative. 410 00:43:19.122 --> 00:43:21.349 huda: And I think 411",
    " 00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.439 huda: but I feel like that's not really something like interesting enough to write about. 412 00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:26.570 huda: But 413 00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.630 Jenny Duan: What else do you feel like? Has shaped you as a person. 414 00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:40.739 huda: What do you do? You have like any like kind of examples of like 415 00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.220 huda: like an Essie, that someone might write like cause I I'm kind of 416 00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.750 huda: having trouble like thinking of, like specifically what 417 00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.740 huda: I might have like a story. 418 00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:52.880 huda: both. 419 00:43:53.900 --> 00:44:18.519 Jenny Duan: So for me, like the essay that I wrote was about the 1st time I held a brain, and I use that to connect to like, how I'm interested in what makes people human and what like brings people together cause like, I think, at the end of the day, like all of our brains are pretty much the same, or like look pretty much the same. But like there's so much individuality in each one of our experiences, and that's like what motivates me to be like a cognitive science major, and to think about 420 00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:24.920 Jenny Duan: like the way that people are and why they are the way they are, which are like the questions I think about every day. 421 00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:33.629 Jenny Duan: But for you, since you're interested in, like the intersection of you know, design technology, ethics, gaming film and media. 422 00:44:34.094 --> 00:44:37.550 Jenny Duan: Maybe there's like some object or some example that 423 00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.850 Jenny Duan: I guess, connects to. 424 00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah how you are or why you are the way you are. 425 00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.330 Jenny Duan: But let me think. 426 00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.000 Jenny Duan: Arms. 427 00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.849 huda: I feel like, maybe. 428 00:45:",
    "12.910 --> 00:45:36.840 huda: okay, this one's like, kind of going back into like game development. But like, maybe like this software was called Unity, and that's kind of like where I did a lot of like the script writing and like like story writing for centuria. But I also did a lot of the code, and also did a lot of the art, and like everything on that. And that was like kind of a really big 429 00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.110 huda: software that I use. But I think. 430 00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.410 huda: yeah, I don't know if that's like, really like. 431 00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.958 huda: like, kind of poetic enough. 432 00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:48.499 Jenny Duan: I I'm thinking about something that you could write about, like. 433 00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.480 Jenny Duan: how different words have, like. 434 00:45:52.030 --> 00:46:04.769 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me try to elucidate this in the clearest way that I can like. How different. Okay, so the the theme is like trying to draw the power of like storytelling words language together. And so you could write something about how like. 435 00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:13.760 Jenny Duan: okay, unity is is a word that means different things. Right? It's first, st it's a computer sign like, it's a computer programming thing that like 436 00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:26.475 Jenny Duan: allows you to create games and create new world unity is also a SIM synonym for like peace or togetherness, which is like what you strive to to do, and like your advocacy, including like folklift, and like 437 00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:36.420 Jenny Duan: the Muslim like mosque thing, etc, etc, etc. So you could talk about like the power of like storytelling languages and words, and like you could use that to connect 438 00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:39.060 Jenny Duan: for example, like 439 00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:43.077 Jenny Duan: speaking different languages and beyond English or 440 00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:50.639 Jenny Duan: you could use that to connect, like ",
    "you knowing computer science languages, and how those also enable you to like build new worlds. 441 00:46:50.690 --> 00:47:08.320 Jenny Duan: And but so I think, like something along that, like fuzzy realm of like languages, storytelling connection, and like connecting that to like computer science languages like your advocacy, the stories that you tell through folklift, through jcamp, etc, etc, etc, and like finding a way to piece all of that together. 442 00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:14.819 Jenny Duan: as like the main theme, I think that's something. But let me think about how to best structure that. 443 00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:27.065 huda: Okay, it could. I was thinking, like, maybe I could be like, unity takes many different forms. Unity is the software where I made my 1st game. Unity is 444 00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:34.230 huda: the like the communion of my Muslim community on Fridays, when we go to pray and then 445 00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.520 huda: sorry. What did he say? 446 00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.410 Jenny Duan: I said, that's amazing. Continue. 447 00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:43.309 huda: Thank you. And then like one more example, and then and then after that, I could be like. 448 00:47:44.138 --> 00:47:47.210 huda: unity is like 449 00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:52.899 huda: like. For example, I could also say, like unity is my! 450 00:47:53.640 --> 00:48:16.232 huda: Like the 4 languages I can speak all meaning the same thing at the end of the day, and then I can talk about like maybe, like like I could tell story through like through the coding languages that I know would like my games, and then I can talk about like how I can tell stories in English. Through like journalism. I can tell 451 00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.660 huda: I guess like stories through. 452 00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:33.549 huda: Okay, this one's a bit corny, but like like kindness, like supporting people. And that would be like also in like another language cause I, I see, like kindness, is kind of ofte",
    "n seen as like a language. So I think. 453 00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.959 huda: like saying, like, this is universal, and that's what make languages like 454 00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.890 huda: unite, I guess. 455 00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.498 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. 456 00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.040 Jenny Duan: I think that that's that's awesome. I mean, that sounds really good to me. 457 00:48:50.260 --> 00:49:05.850 Jenny Duan: and I think that, like the piece about unity or the phrasing about unity, I think that can go in the middle like I don't. I think that's like something that should go in the middle of the essay. But I'm trying to figure out like how to connect the overarching theme together. I feel like 458 00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:07.900 Jenny Duan: starting off with that is not 459 00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:14.740 Jenny Duan: super compelling, like I think you could find a way to make the beginning like a little bit more interesting. But right now I'm 460 00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.160 Jenny Duan: thinking about the best 461 00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.680 Jenny Duan: way to start this. Say. 462 00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:32.360 Jenny Duan: yeah. 463 00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.570 Jenny Duan: who may think? 464 00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:44.870 Jenny Duan: So you're we're writing about language. What gives what gives words meaning computer science technology. 465 00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.310 Jenny Duan: cetera. 466 00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:54.539 Jenny Duan: like I could see like there's something in the be. There's like one paragraph in the beginning. And then it goes, or like couple of paragraphs, and it goes like. 467 00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.979 Jenny Duan: take the word unity, for example. 468 00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:03.048 Jenny Duan: and then goes into like what you just said, and then it goes into something else. After that like I see that is like the. 469 00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:14.709 huda: I think away. I thought of like an interesting idea, ",
    "but I feel like I don't know if it W. Would work, but like so like, maybe, for like a hook, I can like write something in a language that I made up. 470 00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:23.640 huda: and then and then be like. This phrase means this, and then, I don't know. Okay, I feel like it might be like a bit confusing. But like 471 00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:35.499 huda: that's like kind of like talking about language like languages are just kind of like made up, but like they all like have the different meetings. That's kind of the whole thing that we're talking about 472 00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.999 huda: so I don't know. I feel like that would be an interesting hook, but I don't know if it makes sense like readers. 473 00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:51.280 Jenny Duan: I think that that could make sense. Tell me more about how you see that fitting in the context of the rest of your essay. 474 00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.490 huda: Like, for example, like, let me just. 475 00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.840 Jenny Duan: Are you typing in the doc? 476 00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.590 huda: Yeah. 477 00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.539 huda: no, I'm typing in the meeting chat. 478 00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:11.510 Jenny Duan: Okay. Okay. Cool. 479 00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:41.600 huda: Okay, wait. No. Actually thinking about this kind of sounds like, I don't think it would make sense like I don't know how to. I wouldn't be able to like articulate it well enough so that, like the person, will just be confused the whole time. So maybe like a different of good work. 480 00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.249 Jenny Duan: Wait. Did you send it into the chat? 481 00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:57.240 huda: Yeah, I don't. Okay. This is like the. This would be like the first, st like 2 sentences, and then. 482 00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:58.890 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, yeah. 483 00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.500 Jenny Duan: What is that? What is that? 484 00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.080 Jenny Duan: What language is that. 485 00:52:03.670 --> 00:",
    "52:05.490 huda: I just made it up. I'd be like 486 00:52:05.967 --> 00:52:14.879 huda: like languages are just something that like humans created on their own. But they but every language has the same meaning 487 00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.710 huda: and then, like. 488 00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:24.559 huda: I don't know. Maybe like, go into how like I'm able to use like different languages. To like 489 00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:28.150 huda: kind of do the same thing, which is like storytelling 490 00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:41.399 huda: and then, like, like, maybe like they use example later, like the paragraph about like unity, you'd be like, unity is just one word, but it's also takes many forms like game development. 491 00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:49.429 huda: like writing like that's kinda what I was thinking, but I don't know. I feel like this. This hook might not make sense. 492 00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:55.280 Jenny Duan: Hmm! I think that that makes sense. I'm wondering. 493 00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:04.109 Jenny Duan: Let me think of something else we could do. Let's okay. That's a good hook. Let me see if there's any other story you could bring into your life. 494 00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.129 Jenny Duan: You could. You could talk about how like 495 00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.520 Jenny Duan: another theme you could talk about is how like 496 00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:51.690 Jenny Duan: human connection evolves from the way that we communicate with one another in various forms, whether that's like 3 texting bubbles on a screen like handwritten letters by line in a news article, like something regardless of what it is like. There's different ways that we can signal our attention to other people. 497 00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:57.590 Jenny Duan: and like in a world where, like, there's so many things that draw our attention away like sometimes. 498 00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:58.860 Jenny Duan: like 499 00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.450 Jenny Duan: the time it takes to read, one sentence is like ",
    "very precious and valuable 500 00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:12.359 Jenny Duan: in like the broad scheme of things. But like, that's all like sort of the Meta analysis of the essay. But I'm like trying to focus on like how to get. 501 00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:22.140 Jenny Duan: I think the 1st part will be like kind of hard, because once you start into the like reflection aspect of it. I think there's like a lot to to pull out here. But like 502 00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:26.770 Jenny Duan: I'm wondering what's the best way you can capture someone's attention like right away. 503 00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:59.859 Jenny Duan: You remember what your 1st word was, or do you know? Didn't do? No, I guess you wouldn't remember. But like. 504 00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.719 huda: Yeah, I'll probably I'll I'll ask my parents. I don't know. 505 00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.300 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 506 00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.739 huda: Wait. Okay? And then I I edited like the In the chat I edited kind of like 507 00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.489 huda: what it would look like. So it'd be like 508 00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:35.400 huda: these random words, and I would be like, that means nice to meet you. I made that language 5 min ago, but it, interestingly enough, conveys the same meaning of a language made 5,000 years ago. 509 00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:51.890 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that seems good for now. Like, do you feel like, do you feel the source of information like, do you feel like you could just write this 510 00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.969 Jenny Duan: cause. I feel like sometimes like when you're thinking about an essay like it should feel a little bit natural like 511 00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.760 Jenny Duan: it should just flow. 512 00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.649 huda: Wait. How long is this essay supposed to be? Cause? I don't like 513 00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:03.935 huda: yeah. 514 00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:07.550 huda: How many words. 515 00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:08.860 Jenny Duan: 50. 516 00:56:09.570 ",
    "--> 00:56:10.140 huda: 50. 517 00:56:10.442 --> 00:56:12.260 Jenny Duan: 6 50. It's not that much. 518 00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.160 huda: Like what? 519 00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:31.480 huda: Okay? I think I think I should probably be able to. But I feel like with this essay, like I could definitely talk a little bit like a lot about like my different storytelling, like the different languages and stuff. But would kind of like analyzing the like 520 00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:36.139 huda: like language. And it's kind of ability to 521 00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:48.530 huda: or like like, would it like analyzing like language and its ability to like be used in different like mediums and stuff. Would that be like drawing like the attention away from myself in the essay. 522 00:56:49.200 --> 00:57:10.739 Jenny Duan: I think you would put yourself in the essay by talking about like your programming or your journalism, or like how language is a conduit for storytelling, for human connection, for kind of people all around the world like you can change a language on tick, tock to like, go viral, you know stuff like that like that's all. Encompass under the broader theme of like language. 523 00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:12.189 Jenny Duan: or communicate. 524 00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.710 huda: I was thinking like. 525 00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:21.630 huda: could I talk about like, how like in like spoken languages, specifically like, maybe telling 526 00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:29.430 huda: like a story like my mom telling a story to me when I was younger like. And then that being like said in Hindi, and then, like. 527 00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.320 huda: I don't know or like. 528 00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:40.599 huda: or how about like my grandma telling a story to my mom in Hindi and then like, now she tells it to me in English, and like. 529 00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.109 huda: would that like 530 00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:50.391 huda: draw like, would that be about someone else, or like, I feel lik",
    "e that? That'd be like an interesting thing to talk about as well. But again I don't wanna like 531 00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.199 Jenny Duan: What would you be trying to convey with that. 532 00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.030 huda: Like the fact that 533 00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.340 huda: I guess like 534 00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:06.670 huda: like the same kind of thing that I meant, and like the the hook that, like like languages don't draw away from like what you can do like, for example, like 535 00:58:07.012 --> 00:58:17.910 huda: like my grandma tells the same story as like my mom does, and even those in like different languages. It's like, it's still like teaching the same morals. Still, kind of like entertaining the same. 536 00:58:18.602 --> 00:58:20.899 huda: Yeah, that's kind of what I'm. 537 00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.930 Jenny Duan: Are different. 538 00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:26.620 Jenny Duan: There are words in some languages that don't have direct translations and say like English. 539 00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:29.450 Jenny Duan: And that's also like kind of interesting, too. 540 00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:39.030 Jenny Duan: because language holds more, so much more than just meaning. It holds like generations of context and history that can't really be captured in direct translation. Sometimes. 541 00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.900 huda: Yeah, I guess. But like. 542 00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:48.530 huda: if the whole like essay is about like how like language has no barriers, and I think 543 00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.970 huda: it kind of makes sense that like 544 00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.809 huda: kind of don't really like focus on, like 545 00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.600 huda: the few words that can't be translated, because, like. 546 00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.440 huda: I feel like, if the whole essay is about that, then 547 00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:06.590 huda: it might not be like a good topic. If it's like, if if there's like some meaning that's lost. 548 00:59:09.210 -",
    "-> 00:59:13.519 Jenny Duan: Yeah, can you tell me a bit about how this essay would be structured? Then. 549 00:59:15.616 --> 00:59:17.750 huda: Yeah. So after this hook. 550 00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:24.209 huda: maybe I talk about like I, I technically know, like 5 languages. 551 00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:25.620 huda: And so 552 00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:29.639 huda: thank you. And so like I can be like 553 00:59:32.008 --> 00:59:36.689 huda: Like knowing 5 languages. Verbally, or like, I guess. 554 00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:39.349 huda: knowing 5 languages. 555 00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:47.660 huda: cause, I know, like more languages technically, if it's like based off of like coding and stuff. So that's like. And that's what we're gonna talk about later. 556 00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:49.230 huda: But like 557 00:59:51.570 --> 01:00:07.250 huda: maybe right after the hook I could talk about like I'm a speaker of many languages, whether it be, and then like name, like the verbal languages that I know, and then or and like the coding languages that I know I could be like. 558 01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.531 huda: I I'm able to. 559 01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:16.600 huda: I guess I I tell stories in every. 560 01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.510 huda: in every 561 01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:20.959 huda: tongue that I can speak. I think 562 01:00:22.515 --> 01:00:24.339 huda: and then I can like 563 01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:46.569 huda: thank you. And then I could, and then I could like, do like different paragraphs, kind of like on, like the main things that I do like. For example, I think one thing I really should focus on is like game development. And that's like a 1 way. I really like like to tell stories. But and then the next one could be about like English and like 564 01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.499 huda: using and like telling stories. 565 01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.910 huda: I think. Wait. Would it be fine to like mention folklift? Because, like, I feel like. 566 01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:05.619 hud",
    "a: if I'm able to say that, like I'm promoting like stuff of my culture and like writing it, we're telling stories in English. I'm able to like portray it to people that only understand English 567 01:01:06.217 --> 01:01:09.430 huda: and that like breaks the barrier of language, like 568 01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.889 huda: the fact that, like 569 01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:14.469 huda: stories that would normally be told in like Hindi, to like. 570 01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:18.420 huda: break the barriers of language and be told to people that speak English. 571 01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:22.419 huda: So I think I could mention folklift there 572 01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:23.880 huda: and then. 573 01:01:24.656 --> 01:01:28.809 huda: After that I can maybe do like a like a paragraph about 574 01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.350 huda: maybe like filmmaking with like 575 01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:44.100 huda: photography and stuff. Cause that one's like a language that. 576 01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:53.980 huda: Well, okay, I think that kind of contradicts, like the topic of the essay. But, like visual language, should that like? Would that contradict it? Or 577 01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.970 huda: like, is photography fine. 578 01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:22.210 Jenny Duan: I think photography is fine. I think like language could be anything you want, because if the theme of the essay is like communication and storytelling. I don't think it has to be exactly like language like language could be interpreted super broadly. I think so. Photography could definitely count as a medium for communication. Just like, you know, language is a medium for communication. Journalism is a media medium for communication. So it's like Tiktok, even Youtube, even like game design. 579 01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.460 Jenny Duan: And obviously also photography. 580 01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:44.999 huda: Okay, then photography. And I don't know if like, I I was thinking, like, maybe like describing like one like a picture tha",
    "t I took which tells like, which is like, really like telling. Like, for example, I took. Okay, this is not really a good example, but like, for example, in London I like took a picture of like a guard, and then. 581 01:02:45.020 --> 01:03:04.229 huda: like the framing, showed it like the authority, and, like the people framed behind him like looked kind of like in awe. Slash like respectful but like this is not a good example, like I'll probably find like a better picture where I did storytelling. But yeah, and then I could like describe that. And like. 582 01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:09.869 huda: like a photographers like kind of thought process in telling stories through photography. 583 01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.129 huda: And then I think I could like wrap it up from there and be like 584 01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:17.389 huda: oh, well, actually like no, I think Anita mentioned Unity right? So I think 585 01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:20.870 huda: that could be like my concluding paragraph. Maybe, like 586 01:03:21.395 --> 01:03:38.000 huda: like the word unity is my game system, like the word unity is like the me volunteering, or like our Muslim community at the mosque. And then that could be like, maybe, like my concluding paragraph, or like right before. 587 01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:52.349 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. And then what is the contents of the essay? So like, what are you focusing within the inside of your essay? So starting off with talking about, like, you know the meaning of this of the story in in Hindi and English, right. 588 01:03:54.803 --> 01:03:55.569 Jenny Duan: And then. 589 01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.178 huda: I forgot about that. 590 01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:03.979 huda: I don't think I did. I don't think I mentioned that in like the overview. Where would I put that? I think. 591 01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.160 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! I thought you wanted to. I oh, sorry. Not the meeting like your mom telling you the story. 592 01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.190 Jenny ",
    "Duan: Yeah. So. 593 01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.419 huda: Got to add that into the story, but I think it. 594 01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.770 huda: I think. 595 01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.790 huda: Do you think they'll like add to the story, or like detract from it. 596 01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:20.319 Jenny Duan: I feel like. 597 01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.530 Jenny Duan: how else would do you want to start it 598 01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.680 Jenny Duan: like. 599 01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.559 huda: I was just gonna talk about like 600 01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:41.730 huda: like being able to speak many languages and like like, it wasn't the like. The the brag points that really like made me love ha! Being able to speak so many languages. It was like the fact that I'd be able to like tell stories. 601 01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:44.989 huda: I guess this could be like a good way to like 602 01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.550 huda: good way to 603 01:04:47.420 --> 01:05:17.059 huda: Tell it. And also like, maybe if I wanted to talk about like the story that my that my grandma said to my mom, I could be like, my, my grandma's told my mom the story in Hindi, and my mom told that story to me in English and knowing like now, as like someone who can speak many languages. I'm able to like. I can like hear this story from, like my grandmother and my mother, and like and pass it on, and kind of 604 01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:22.669 huda: break the barriers of language. I think that could be it if I wanted to use the 605 01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.119 huda: story that my grandmother said. 606 01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.949 Jenny Duan: Okay, are there? Is there any other way you think you can start this cause? I feel like 607 01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:33.790 Jenny Duan: like that could work too. I'm just curious. If you have any other ideas. 608 01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.650 huda: Hmm! 609 01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:54.539 huda: Maybe like I could talk about like 610 01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.819 huda: how as",
    " like a shy person 611 01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:05.270 huda: it like it feels like, you know, like 0 languages, I guess but like when but like 612 01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:16.119 huda: like as my like identity like I know, like 5 different languages, and like, I know, all these like different languages, and so, like being our be able to like. Use them as like 613 01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:22.680 huda: like articulation to tell stories like, I think that's how I could go about it. 614 01:06:23.295 --> 01:06:23.890 huda: Maybe 615 01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:24.840 huda: like. 616 01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:35.730 huda: like, maybe like finding as like someone who feels like they have like 0 languages going to feel like they have like 5 plus languages after they tell stories. Maybe that could be like 617 01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.260 huda: a good way to start it. 618 01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:44.780 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, is there like a specific scene? You can put someone into the reader into. 619 01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:53.490 Jenny Duan: Avoid as much like pure description as possible, and try to put the reader even seen. 620 01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.590 huda: Could it be like? 621 01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:57.920 huda: Could it be like a scene where 622 01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:07.730 huda: like, I don't know, like just an instance of like me being like quiet or like shy, and then, like someone asked me, like. 623 01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:15.349 huda: are kind of like saying like, Oh, you know 0 languages. And then I can like, reflect on like. 624 01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:28.010 huda: did like? Do I really know 0 languages? I technically know? 5. But what's my like ability? What what are like the languages that I know without being able to tell stories with them. 625 01:07:28.856 --> 01:07:30.559 huda: That could be like 626 01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:33.160 huda: like a story like a setting that I could 627 01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.370 huda: say 628 01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:37.850 huda: I like ",
    "dialogue. 629 01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.839 Jenny Duan: Cool. Sounds perfect. 630 01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:51.850 Jenny Duan: I think that's a good start. Why don't we try that? If you could just write like 631 01:07:52.590 --> 01:08:07.030 Jenny Duan: spend only like 2 h and just write like a really really bad 1st draft. And we should just check in on this next time we meet to see if it feels natural if we want to pivot again and like what you're thinking about this. I know we have a meeting set up on 632 01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.380 Jenny Duan: I. We have these have tomorrow. Do you think that's enough time for you to 633 01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:17.729 Jenny Duan: come back to this? Or do you wanna skip our meeting tomorrow and just do it on Tuesday? 634 01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:21.080 huda: Wait. What time will the meeting tomorrow be? 635 01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.279 Jenny Duan: Have it from 3 30 to 4 30 pst. 636 01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:28.649 huda: A, 637 01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:29.809 huda: I think. 638 01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:34.899 huda: Can I get back to you like maybe by tonight, like 639 01:08:35.049 --> 01:08:43.809 huda: I can like, ask my mom for going anywhere at that time, and as well cause if we're going then I'll be able to just like work on the essay in the morning. But 640 01:08:44.099 --> 01:08:46.299 huda: yeah, I'll let you know by like. 641 01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:49.689 huda: maybe like a couple like minutes after the call. 642 01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:54.539 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, no pressure at all. I think. Like as long as you're able to spend just like 643 01:08:54.599 --> 01:09:08.699 Jenny Duan: one to 2 h like, just don't spend a lot of time on this. Just start writing it to see if the structure and flow feels like good to you, and then we can discuss. If we want to like, continue workshopping this essay, or if you want to pivot to a different theme later on. 644 01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:09.330 huda: Okay. 645 01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:17.100 Jenny ",
    "Duan: I feel like this is a good good idea so far I'm excited to see you write it. But like, how do you feel about it right now? 646 01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:25.829 huda: I feel like I definitely have, like a stronger foundation with this essay than the last one. So I I'm feeling a little more confident about like writing this. 647 01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:31.769 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you have any questions I can answer like anything you want to clarify before you get started drafting it. 648 01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:38.070 huda: Not at the moment. I think it makes sense right now. Yeah. 649 01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:44.669 Jenny Duan: Okay, feel free to text me if you have any questions, and then we'll either meet tomorrow or if not tomorrow. Then on Tuesday. 650 01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.830 huda: Okay. Great. 651 01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:48.739 Jenny Duan: Alright awesome bye. Take care! 652 01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.115 huda: Bye."
