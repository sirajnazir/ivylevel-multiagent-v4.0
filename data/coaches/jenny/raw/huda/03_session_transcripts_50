How's it going. 2 00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.000 huda: Hi, Jenny! 3 00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.450 Jenny Duan: Hi! How's it going. 4 00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.924 huda: It's going well, how are you? 5 00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:05.942 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well, too. I thought I wanted to see what you wanted to focus today. Session on if you wanted to. 6 00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:15.290 Jenny Duan: keep on working on scaling social medias in your marketing. Or if there's something else that you wanted to like cover today. 7 00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.560 huda: I think today we could focus a little more on the college applications, or like maybe the notion. 8 00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So I'm wondering if you got a chance to fill it in some more. Let me take a look at that right now. 9 00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:41.259 huda: Yeah, I put in. I think 10 of colleges and the the only like, I guess, safe or like match was chapman. 10 00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.984 Jenny Duan: Okay? So okay, yeah, I see, I see there's 9 schools here. 11 00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.579 Jenny Duan: so I think we should kind of expand on like some more safety and match schools. 12 00:06:56.148 --> 00:07:05.679 Jenny Duan: I think we can count like the Uc. Application as sort of one application. But how many schools do you plan to apply to out of all the Ucs. 13 00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.910 huda: I think 14 00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.720 huda: I tried. I think maybe like 15 00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.599 huda: I don't really want to apply to Merced 16 00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.160 huda: but like I think 17 00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.779 huda: all of them besides, like maybe San Diego and Santa Barbara Emer, said. 18 00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.090 Jenny Duan: Oh, why not San Diego? 19 00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:35.090 huda: I'm not sure I don't. I don't think they have like a really great like program for what I like. And yeah. 20 00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.219 Jenny Duan: Got it? 21 00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.960 Jenny Duan: you know. I think that their Cs program is like, pretty good. But 22 00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.920 Jenny Duan: is it? Are you? Do you have issues with like the program or the school. 23 00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:54.880 huda: I mean, I don't really think I have like an any issue with San Diego. I could. I could possibly apply there. But I haven't really considered it. 24 00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.185 Jenny Duan: Okay, got it. 25 00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.879 Jenny Duan: is there a reason why you haven't considered? I just. I'm curious, because I feel like that's 1 of the more popular Ucs. 26 00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.455 huda: Yeah, I don't know. I just 27 00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:17.819 huda: yeah, like, I haven't heard anything like a sounding about it. But I think I mean, like I could apply there. I just haven't like looked at the majors or anything. But yeah. 28 00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.950 Jenny Duan: Okay? So maybe we can like fill in 29 00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:24.400 Jenny Duan: the rest of the Ucs. So 30 00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.576 Jenny Duan: we plan to do like Uc. Berkeley. 31 00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:38.849 Jenny Duan: let me just open up the Uc. Application like tab of your notion. You see, Berkeley, Uc. LA. You see, Irvine. 32 00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.819 Jenny Duan: what else? 33 00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:49.029 Jenny Duan: What other uses do you want to apply to. So you said not Merced, not Santa Barbara, not San Diego. What else. 34 00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.195 huda: Thing. 35 00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.849 Jenny Duan: Oh, Hi! I think you're freezing a little bit. Okay. You're back now. 36 00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.640 huda: Okay, so let me just pull up all the uses. 37 00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.440 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 38 00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.439 Jenny Duan: I think you're cutting in and out for me. Still, wait. Okay, now you're back. 39 00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.410 Jenny Duan: Can you repeat what you just said? 40 00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.430 huda: Oh, wait! Did I cut up. 41 00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.195 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you just dropped, and now you're back. But I think you're 42 00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.020 Jenny Duan: still cutting in and out for me. 43 00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.360 Jenny Duan: Hey, Sarajeh? 44 00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.190 Jenny Duan: Yes. 45 00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:36.551 Siraj Nazir: Hi, I'm I'm actually joining in my desk computer because mine isn't like working. For some reason. 46 00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.047 Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. Glad that you were able to make it back. 47 00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:48.090 Jenny Duan: okay. So just to pick up our conversation, I think that we 48 00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.409 Jenny Duan: would 49 00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:00.909 Jenny Duan: like. Let's continue talking about the Uc schools. So what schools are you interested in? I think we talked about this before. But just to confirm. You see, Berkeley, ucla uc Irvine. 50 00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:10.869 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. So uc, Berkeley, uc, Davis, uc irvine ucla maybe just uc riverside as a backup. 51 00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.186 Siraj Nazir: and then 52 00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:20.555 Siraj Nazir: you, I guess. You see, San Diego, I think I might have to do a little research on like what metered do there and then. 53 00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.070 Siraj Nazir: uc Santa Cruz. 54 00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.199 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's look at the majors right now. Actually. 55 00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.290 Jenny Duan: so 56 00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.359 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna go on their website and look at their majors. 57 00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.570 Jenny Duan: okay. 58 00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.950 Jenny Duan: majors within the CS. 59 00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.453 Jenny Duan: They have 60 00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.311 Jenny Duan: computer science. Obviously, let's see if they have media studies. 61 00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.060 Jenny Duan: hey? 62 00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.310 Siraj Nazir: They have visual arts, media. 63 00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.719 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's that's like an art degree. I don't know if that's what you're looking for. 64 00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.550 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 65 00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.753 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think they would have just like a general computer science major. 66 00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.959 Jenny Duan: or they have cognitive sciences if you're interested in that. But I think. 67 00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:26.670 Jenny Duan: Do any of these majors interest you? 68 00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:33.520 Siraj Nazir: I think cognitive science, if they have like some sort of I know. 69 00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:38.189 Siraj Nazir: for for some of the colleges that I looked at I think it was 70 00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.550 Siraj Nazir: owned 71 00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:48.419 Siraj Nazir: one of the majors I looked at there was like cognitive side. So like focus on 72 00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.540 Siraj Nazir: like media arts or something. 73 00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.159 Siraj Nazir: I don't know if that's the correct or it was a focus on computer science or something like that. 74 00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:01.430 Jenny Duan: I have a cognitive science with a focus on machine learning and neural computation. 75 00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.640 Jenny Duan: What do you think. 76 00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.490 Siraj Nazir: I think, yeah, I think that's something I'd be interested in. 77 00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.719 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and then 78 00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.200 Jenny Duan: I think. 79 00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:17.090 Jenny Duan: okay, so would Ucsd be a a school that you want to go to 80 00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:24.929 Jenny Duan: cause. If it's not. Then, I think, like there's no point to go. But if you, if you would want to go there, then obviously 81 00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.300 Jenny Duan: it would be good. 82 00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.539 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean, I think if I got in then I'd definitely love to go. 83 00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:30.960 Jenny Duan: Okay? 84 00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.109 Jenny Duan: Then let's put that down 85 00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.860 Jenny Duan: on the other side 86 00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.719 Jenny Duan: for the other schools. Do you know what, Major? You wanna apply to. 87 00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.319 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. So for Irvine, I wanna do interactive media and game design. 88 00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.960 Jenny Duan: Great. Would you be able to add this to the notion? 89 00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.220 Jenny Duan: Do you see where I'm typing right now? I don't know if you can see, actually live updates on notion. 90 00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.100 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I don't think I can. 91 00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.380 Siraj Nazir: Is it like the major list? 92 00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.190 Jenny Duan: No, I'm typing. 93 00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.840 Jenny Duan: Maybe that would actually be a better place to add it. 94 00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:16.529 Jenny Duan: I'm just typing it in the Uc. Application. But I think. Let me add it to the major list. That would probably be better. 95 00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.400 Jenny Duan: Okay. You see, San Diego would be like cognitive signs. 96 00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.550 Jenny Duan: Let me see, is this the Ps or BA, 97 00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.980 Jenny Duan: BS, okay. 98 00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.639 Jenny Duan: okay. Do you see where I added it. 99 00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:48.949 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I can see it. 100 00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 101 00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.699 Jenny Duan: It's not a, it's not a selective status major. So it should be okay. 102 00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.600 Siraj Nazir: Hmm. 103 00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.834 Siraj Nazir: okay, and then for Irvine, there's a major. 104 00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.550 Jenny Duan: You said you said a school before San Diego. What was the other school. 105 00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.756 Siraj Nazir: I think. Did I say? 106 00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:14.100 Siraj Nazir: Davis? Yeah. 107 00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:16.400 Jenny Duan: No! What was Davis's again. 108 00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:19.889 Siraj Nazir: Davis was also cognitive science. I think. 109 00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.740 Jenny Duan: With a specialization in. 110 00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.479 Siraj Nazir: Let me look into that actually. 111 00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.019 Siraj Nazir: I don't know if they have that. 112 00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.770 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 113 00:23:52.793 --> 00:23:53.919 Siraj Nazir: Maybe like 114 00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.930 Siraj Nazir: they 115 00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:02.290 Siraj Nazir: show like logic for artificial intelligence. But I'm not sure if that's like a specialization. 116 00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.840 Jenny Duan: Okay, is that a specialization in cognitive science. 117 00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:18.649 Siraj Nazir: There's there's a yeah. There's a major in cognitive science. Which is a Bs, and then there's a computational emphasis. And then that's like 118 00:24:19.286 --> 00:24:20.220 Siraj Nazir: more about 119 00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.979 Siraj Nazir: like coding, and everything. 120 00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. So so for Uc. Davis, it's Bs come to signs with the computation emphasis. 121 00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.090 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 122 00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.940 Jenny Duan: Okay, and what about Irvine? 123 00:24:30.985 --> 00:24:32.925 Siraj Nazir: So there's a major 124 00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:38.419 Siraj Nazir: game. There's a BS called game design and interactive media. 125 00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:38.949 Jenny Duan: Okay. 126 00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.440 Jenny Duan: That's like a Really, that's like a perfect major for you. 127 00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.825 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 128 00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.840 Siraj Nazir: yeah. I don't think there's any focuses on this one. 129 00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.850 Jenny Duan: Okay. 130 00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:54.819 Siraj Nazir: But yeah. 131 00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.716 Siraj Nazir: and then 132 00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.030 Jenny Duan: What are the other schools? So the other Uc schools. 133 00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.549 Siraj Nazir: So for Berkeley, I wanted to do 134 00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.520 Siraj Nazir: media studies with a focus on. 135 00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.940 Jenny Duan: Fba. Or Bs. 136 00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:18.806 Siraj Nazir: Let me check again. 137 00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.100 Jenny Duan: No worries. 138 00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.883 Siraj Nazir: Actually, I'm not sure. 139 00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.289 Siraj Nazir: wait. I'm not sure if it's a BS or B 140 00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.660 Siraj Nazir: home. 141 00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.570 Jenny Duan: Let me look it up really quickly. 142 00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.329 Jenny Duan: What is the major name? Can you repeat that one more time. 143 00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.779 Siraj Nazir: Media studies. 144 00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.439 Jenny Duan: I think it's probably a BA 145 00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.150 Jenny Duan: Erm, ly. 146 00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.749 Jenny Duan: BA. Okay. 147 00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.110 Jenny Duan: Okay, what about Uc riverside? 148 00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.720 Siraj Nazir: Let me check what? Major. 149 00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.740 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 150 00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.680 Siraj Nazir: Hmm. 151 00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:44.119 Siraj Nazir: maybe data science. I'm not sure if they have anything similar to cognitive science or 152 00:27:44.709 --> 00:27:51.189 Siraj Nazir: yeah, I don't see anything of a sort, and I don't really want to do media studies. If I do end up going here. 153 00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, so do you. Wanna remove Uc. Riverside from the list. Then. 154 00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.944 Siraj Nazir: I kinda wanna have it as a safety, but 155 00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.989 Jenny Duan: You wanna apply computer science. 156 00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.820 Siraj Nazir: I feel like, I prefer data science over computer science. 157 00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.215 Jenny Duan: Okay. 158 00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.399 Jenny Duan: then let me add data. Science. Then. 159 00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.820 Jenny Duan: okay, what about Santa Cruz? 160 00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.910 Siraj Nazir: I think. And I've heard of like a good game development program there. So 161 00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.310 Siraj Nazir: hmm. 162 00:28:50.745 --> 00:28:52.375 Siraj Nazir: okay, there's 163 00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.100 Siraj Nazir: There's 164 00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.019 Siraj Nazir: yeah. I think I'll do one which is like a Bs and 165 00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.250 Siraj Nazir: computer science computer game design. 166 00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.940 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. 167 00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.220 Jenny Duan: let me write that down. 168 00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:13.679 Siraj Nazir: Options. There's there's a art and design games and playable media. But I think that's a BA 169 00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.399 Jenny Duan: So is there? You said, there's Bs computer science game design. 170 00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.310 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 171 00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.593 Jenny Duan: Oh, that seems like a really good 172 00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:24.610 Jenny Duan: idea! 173 00:29:27.445 --> 00:29:27.940 Siraj Nazir: Hmm. 174 00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.665 Jenny Duan: okay? And then what about 175 00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.919 Jenny Duan: Uc, is that everything? Ucla. 176 00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.319 Siraj Nazir: I don't really have anything for game 177 00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.800 Siraj Nazir: on development. 178 00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:11.529 Siraj Nazir: but they I think they do have something for media. But I know that's like kind of 179 00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.160 Siraj Nazir: more competitive for 180 00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.930 Siraj Nazir: Ucla. Yes. 181 00:30:18.945 --> 00:30:19.610 Siraj Nazir: e. 182 00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.629 Siraj Nazir: Maybe I could also try to do cognitive science here. I'm not sure. 183 00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:40.729 Jenny Duan: Okay, think about what I think would be best to figure out like what would be best for you, not what is least competitive in this case, cause, I think, like game design. Do you think the game design, major is going to be super competitive? Is that your concern. 184 00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.988 Siraj Nazir: They don't have a game design. They they just have like media arts, and I think 185 00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.410 Siraj Nazir: a lot more a lot more like design 186 00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.770 Siraj Nazir: oriented than the other schools. 187 00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.429 Jenny Duan: Would you rather do the more designed one? Or would you rather do like the computer science? One. 188 00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:04.750 Siraj Nazir: I think I'd rather like focus more on computer science, maybe, cause that's a little I know a little more about that. 189 00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.389 Jenny Duan: So for Ucla, would you want to do computer science or data science. 190 00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.345 Siraj Nazir: I was thinking like, maybe since 191 00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:19.660 Siraj Nazir: I've been doing like cognitive science for the other schools. It will be best for this one as well. 192 00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.591 Jenny Duan: Okay, then, maybe data science or cognitive science. 193 00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.360 Jenny Duan: Then, like, we can apply it to like 194 00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.220 Jenny Duan: cognitive science. And then data science as a second 195 00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:32.480 Jenny Duan: like, you know, when they have the list. 196 00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:43.770 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think I don't know. I think that cognitive science if they have like like a focus on kind of computing, then maybe that will be perfect. But. 197 00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.040 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me let's research that right now. 198 00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.100 Jenny Duan: key. 199 00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.209 Jenny Duan: it doesn't look like they. It's in the department of psychology. 200 00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:08.270 Jenny Duan: I don't know if they have a like concentration. 201 00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.890 Jenny Duan: But it's just the code it assigns, Major. 202 00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.290 Jenny Duan: if that's what you're interested in. 203 00:32:15.189 --> 00:32:18.019 Siraj Nazir: I think this is definitely like a lot more 204 00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:25.579 Siraj Nazir: philosophical. So maybe maybe data science would be better than this. 205 00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.820 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good. Then. 206 00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.520 Jenny Duan: okay. 207 00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:40.720 Jenny Duan: I think that's let me see, that's it for all the Uc schools. So 208 00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:47.859 Jenny Duan: now that we have all of these schools. I think that looking at your college list, it would be nice to add a couple of more safety schools. 209 00:32:48.177 --> 00:32:52.782 Jenny Duan: I know that we've kind of discussed this in the past. So are there any 210 00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.049 Jenny Duan: Let me let me look at our list and see like what other schools we've identified for you. 211 00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.420 Jenny Duan: yeah, I do think it'd be nice to add a couple more safety schools, because I feel like this is a pretty 212 00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:13.449 Jenny Duan: tough list so far. Are there any other schools that you would want to consider applying to in California or outside California, too? 213 00:33:14.673 --> 00:33:17.660 Siraj Nazir: I was seeing maybe cal quality, slow. 214 00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:23.295 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think, okay. Cal, Poly, Slow is a good school. I still don't know if that's a safety school. 215 00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:33.859 Jenny Duan: well, yeah, I don't think it's a safety school. I'm gonna say, maybe match let's do regular decision. And then what, Major, would you want to do in poly slow. 216 00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:35.899 Siraj Nazir: Let me check. 217 00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:38.540 Jenny Duan: Okay. I'm also gonna look at the list. 218 00:33:39.916 --> 00:33:42.609 Siraj Nazir: They actually do have a game development program. 219 00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:47.540 Siraj Nazir: So either I can see if they have anything else. 220 00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.190 Jenny Duan: Okay. Awesome. 221 00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:52.069 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think. The game development? 222 00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.910 Siraj Nazir: oh, yeah. And you get to do a lot of like artificial intelligence and everything as well. 223 00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.757 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems 224 00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.279 Jenny Duan: that seems good to me. 225 00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.390 Jenny Duan: Let's add that 226 00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.440 Jenny Duan: is, it Bs game development. 227 00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.829 Siraj Nazir: I think it's actually a concentration for computer science. 228 00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.909 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's not. That's not bad, either. That's fine. 229 00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.470 Siraj Nazir: So it's a Bs computer science with a concentration in 230 00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.580 Siraj Nazir: concentration and video game. 231 00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.679 Siraj Nazir: Bye. 232 00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:49.989 Jenny Duan: Let's see how many schools this is, or how many applications. 12345678910. I think we can add, like 233 00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.350 Jenny Duan: maybe 234 00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.309 Jenny Duan: 2, to like 5 more, 2 to 5 more schools. 235 00:34:57.277 --> 00:35:05.910 Jenny Duan: I know it sounds like a lot of schools, but it's just because the Uc application is is one application for so many schools. That I think it's fine. 236 00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.360 Jenny Duan: what other schools do you think you might be interested in. 237 00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.873 Siraj Nazir: I mean, I think, as a safety, maybe. 238 00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.000 Siraj Nazir: csu Fullerton. 239 00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:31.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, Csu F, and then what school? I mean? What major with it? See with Csu F. 240 00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.090 Siraj Nazir: Let me check. 241 00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.270 Siraj Nazir: Hmm! 242 00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.169 Siraj Nazir: I'm not sure if there's any features for game development. 243 00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.919 Siraj Nazir: Oh, there's signs, though. 244 00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.680 Jenny Duan: There is computer science. 245 00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.300 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 246 00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.890 Jenny Duan: Alright. Let's just add that. And then. 247 00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.790 Jenny Duan: are there any other schools that you think you might be interested in. 248 00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.650 Siraj Nazir: You see if there's any other new csus. 249 00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.719 Siraj Nazir: maybe Csu Long Beach. 250 00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:15.072 Jenny Duan: Okay, would you be genuinely interested to going to to going to this school. 251 00:37:17.086 --> 00:37:18.419 Siraj Nazir: Not really. 252 00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.320 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's not add it. Then what about Csu F. 253 00:37:23.075 --> 00:37:28.079 Siraj Nazir: Csuf. I feel like it's kind of far, I mean, like. 254 00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:36.230 Siraj Nazir: honestly, I think if I weren't to get into like my my top Ucs. I'd probably go to community college and try to do the tag program 255 00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.380 Siraj Nazir: and then. 256 00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:51.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, then let's so. Would you be interested in applying to see to Csu F. Then, if you like to, I think if you don't think you would want to go there. Then let's take it off the list. But what about Cal Poly? Slow? Would you be interested in going to Cal Poly. 257 00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.619 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think that actually be interesting going there. 258 00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:58.590 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's see, like what other schools might be a good fit for you that have, like 259 00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.520 Jenny Duan: less competitive 260 00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.739 Jenny Duan: programs that you would still want to go to 261 00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.780 Jenny Duan: See? 262 00:38:16.016 --> 00:38:18.760 Jenny Duan: What about Georgia? Tech. 263 00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.070 Siraj Nazir: Oh, I thought that was kind of more competitive. 264 00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.110 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's actually, it's more competitive. But 265 00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.259 Jenny Duan: okay, what about Rochester Institute of Technology? Have you heard of that? 266 00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.650 Siraj Nazir: Oh, I haven't. 267 00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.945 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's in Rochester, New York. 268 00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.470 Jenny Duan: they have, like a pretty good 269 00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.649 Jenny Duan: sales made game design major program. 270 00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.020 Jenny Duan: let me write it. Let me give you their website. 271 00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.750 Jenny Duan: None. 272 00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:55.296 Jenny Duan: And I think you could look into this. But I don't know if you would want to go into the 273 00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.070 Jenny Duan: into the east coast. But 274 00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.700 Jenny Duan: this is one option that we can consider. 275 00:39:04.382 --> 00:39:13.350 Siraj Nazir: I think I think that'd be interested in applying. I think it's definitely worth looking at it. If they have a good game development. 276 00:39:14.705 --> 00:39:15.440 Siraj Nazir: program. 277 00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:22.237 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Let's just write it down. It's in upstate New York. That's the only thing like, I don't know if you would want to. 278 00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.580 Jenny Duan: If you're okay with that, then 279 00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.050 Jenny Duan: that's fine. 280 00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.740 Siraj Nazir: I think like if I have to. I I probably would. 281 00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, let me add it down. Then 282 00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.220 Jenny Duan: Rochester 283 00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.540 Jenny Duan: Institute 284 00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.849 Jenny Duan: of Technology. Let's say it's the safety. And then say, regular decision. 285 00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:55.029 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Same design and development. Okay, I think this is enough safety schools. I don't think that you need more safety schools. But are there any other just general schools that you would be interested in applying to. 286 00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:03.189 Siraj Nazir: I'm I'm not sure. I think I think that's all for now. 287 00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.520 Siraj Nazir: Okay. 288 00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:11.300 Jenny Duan: So then, that means like about 11 applications. Total does. Is that feeling good for you? 289 00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.139 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, is that a law or. 290 00:40:13.833 --> 00:40:18.386 Jenny Duan: No, it's it's it's actually I feel like on the lower end for most people. 291 00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:25.740 Jenny Duan: But I don't think that's like a bad thing like, I think that this is a this is a good amount, and I think that you 292 00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.670 Jenny Duan: have a really impressive profile at this point. So I feel like. 293 00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:33.140 Jenny Duan: you know, it's not gonna be an issue. 294 00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.300 Jenny Duan: yeah. Do you have any 295 00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.669 Jenny Duan: like questions or anything else that you would want to add to this list? 296 00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:58.320 Siraj Nazir: No, I think I think this is like a good list, and if like maybe say, say, I get like rejected from all these. I think it's like it's fine, cause I'd probably just be able to do the tag program. 297 00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:14.670 Jenny Duan: Well, I don't think you're gonna get rejected for all of these, or that's that's like, ideally, ideally. Not. So let's not think that way. But being in California, you're right that the community college program is good. But I think that you know, you have a really strong profile, and we're like working on, strengthening it even more still. And so I think 298 00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.780 Jenny Duan: there shouldn't be an issue here. 299 00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.810 Siraj Nazir: Okay. 300 00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 301 00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.460 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 302 00:41:21.963 --> 00:41:28.649 Jenny Duan: Any just double checking anything else that you would wanna add, or do you? Do you feel comfortable with, how this is? 303 00:41:29.457 --> 00:41:33.120 Siraj Nazir: I can maybe do some like research. Like 304 00:41:33.723 --> 00:41:41.050 Siraj Nazir: see if there's any other colleges that I'd be interested in applying to, but for now I think this list is looking pretty good. 305 00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.369 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds good to me. 306 00:41:43.757 --> 00:41:56.640 Jenny Duan: So now I think our next step should be to take a look at your common app essay and start like brainstorming and thinking about this. I I do think, however, that, like common app. 307 00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:01.710 Jenny Duan: actually, I think it might be better to wait till August for the common Fsa. Because 308 00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:12.870 Jenny Duan: I want to have the opportunity to build off of your experiences from the summer into your essay. So I think that we can actually leave this to the end of summer and start this in August. 309 00:42:13.365 --> 00:42:16.450 Jenny Duan: So I don't think that that's like a 310 00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.250 Jenny Duan: going to be a concern. 311 00:42:18.658 --> 00:42:33.360 Jenny Duan: I think that once, now that we have the college list settled in the major list settled, I feel pretty comfortable with the rest of your like college major list document. For now do you have any concerns that you would want to address right now in regards to this list? 312 00:42:34.769 --> 00:42:46.920 Siraj Nazir: not regarding the list. But if we could probably like maybe right now, if we could focus on maybe some scholarships to apply to, since I think that's kind of the next step to do this summer. 313 00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:52.680 Jenny Duan: Definitely. Actually, why don't we start a new tab here? That's like a scholarship planning list? 314 00:42:53.064 --> 00:42:55.069 Jenny Duan: How do you feel about that? 315 00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.969 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, that's great. I think that'd be helpful. 316 00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:02.300 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's see. Well, you did. You customize this? It looks really good. 317 00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.790 Jenny Duan: like all of this. 318 00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.700 Siraj Nazir: Oh, I think like my dad got like 319 00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.010 Jenny Duan: The template. 320 00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:08.670 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 321 00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.410 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it looks.

I just found one more. I just want to add 683 01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:50.590 Jenny Duan: ship 684 01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.019 Jenny Duan: better together. Stem scholarship. 685 01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:56.320 Jenny Duan: Okay. 686 01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:18.590 Jenny Duan: But do you have any other questions? I think this is like a good start for us, and then once we start filling out these applications, we'll like like in newsletters and things. We'll hear more and more on the way. 687 01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.659 Jenny Duan: I think you're muted. 688 01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:35.439 Siraj Nazir: So for for these scholarships, these are kind of things that we're gonna be doing. That I'm gonna be working on next summer or not next summer, but maybe, like next winter, slash, spring. 689 01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.500 Jenny Duan: More like fall, slash, winter, slash, spring. 690 01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:40.460 Siraj Nazir: Oh! This full. 691 01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:41.610 Jenny Duan: This fall. Yeah. 692 01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:42.240 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 693 01:23:43.201 --> 01:23:46.089 Siraj Nazir: Select while while applying to college. 694 01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:47.340 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 695 01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.680 Siraj Nazir: Okay. 696 01:23:49.928 --> 01:23:54.099 Siraj Nazir: okay, that makes sense. I kinda thought I thought it was this summer. But. 697 01:23:54.392 --> 01:24:06.090 Jenny Duan: It's some of them like I don't. I think most of them open it somewhere from the fall to the spring around the same time as the other Scott as the college applications, and like a little bit after the 698 01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.659 Jenny Duan: the college application season. 699 01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.259 Siraj Nazir: Okay, that makes sense. 700 01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:13.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Any other questions. 701 01:24:13.918 --> 01:24:15.589 Siraj Nazir: No, that's all for this week. 702 01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:28.350 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool do you have a focus that you wanted to work on next time? Just so I can like, do any research, or prepare any notes beforehand. If not, we can just like figure it out on the day of too. But is it. 703 01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.990 Siraj Nazir: I think. 704 01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.640 Jenny Duan: Big. 705 01:24:29.977 --> 01:24:43.119 Siraj Nazir: I think we could probably like check back in with kind of scaling. Maybe and I could like give you an update on how like the action items are going. And then as well as 706 01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.259 Siraj Nazir: kind of how to like. 707 01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.379 Siraj Nazir: I guess, like market to things that I've been doing 708 01:24:48.982 --> 01:24:55.290 Siraj Nazir: well, like all my extra curriculars, for like. So they're like the strongest extra curriculas, for when I'm applying. 709 01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:58.009 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. We'll talk about that next time. Then. 710 01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:00.740 Jenny Duan: alright! Take care, bye.",

How's it going. 2 00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.000 huda: Hi, Jenny! 3 00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.450 Jenny Duan: Hi! How's it going. 4 00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.924 huda: It's going well, how are you? 5 00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:05.942 Jenny Duan: I'm doing well, too. I thought I wanted to see what you wanted to focus today. Session on if you wanted to. 6 00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:15.290 Jenny Duan: keep on working on scaling social medias in your marketing. Or if there's something else that you wanted to like cover today. 7 00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.560 huda: I think today we could focus a little more on the college applications, or like maybe the notion. 8 00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.280 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So I'm wondering if you got a chance to fill it in some more. Let me take a look at that right now. 9 00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:41.259 huda: Yeah, I put in. I think 10 of colleges and the the only like, I guess, safe or like match was chapman. 10 00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.984 Jenny Duan: Okay? So okay, yeah, I see, I see there's 9 schools here. 11 00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.579 Jenny Duan: so I think we should kind of expand on like some more safety and match schools. 12 00:06:56.148 --> 00:07:05.679 Jenny Duan: I think we can count like the Uc. Application as sort of one application. But how many schools do you plan to apply to out of all the Ucs. 13 00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.910 huda: I think 14 00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.720 huda: I tried. I think maybe like 15 00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.599 huda: I don't really want to apply to Merced 16 00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.160 huda: but like I think 17 00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.779 huda: all of them besides, like maybe San Diego and Santa Barbara Emer, said. 18 00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.090 Jenny Duan: Oh, why not San Diego? 19 00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:35.090 huda: I'm not sure I don't. I don'",
    "t think they have like a really great like program for what I like. And yeah. 20 00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.219 Jenny Duan: Got it? 21 00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.960 Jenny Duan: you know. I think that their Cs program is like, pretty good. But 22 00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.920 Jenny Duan: is it? Are you? Do you have issues with like the program or the school. 23 00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:54.880 huda: I mean, I don't really think I have like an any issue with San Diego. I could. I could possibly apply there. But I haven't really considered it. 24 00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.185 Jenny Duan: Okay, got it. 25 00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.879 Jenny Duan: is there a reason why you haven't considered? I just. I'm curious, because I feel like that's 1 of the more popular Ucs. 26 00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.455 huda: Yeah, I don't know. I just 27 00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:17.819 huda: yeah, like, I haven't heard anything like a sounding about it. But I think I mean, like I could apply there. I just haven't like looked at the majors or anything. But yeah. 28 00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.950 Jenny Duan: Okay? So maybe we can like fill in 29 00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:24.400 Jenny Duan: the rest of the Ucs. So 30 00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.576 Jenny Duan: we plan to do like Uc. Berkeley. 31 00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:38.849 Jenny Duan: let me just open up the Uc. Application like tab of your notion. You see, Berkeley, Uc. LA. You see, Irvine. 32 00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.819 Jenny Duan: what else? 33 00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:49.029 Jenny Duan: What other uses do you want to apply to. So you said not Merced, not Santa Barbara, not San Diego. What else. 34 00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.195 huda: Thing. 35 00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.849 Jenny Duan: Oh, Hi! I think you're freezing a little bit. Okay. You're back now. 36 00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.640 huda: Okay, so let me just pull up all the uses. 37 00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.440 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 38 00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.439 Jenny Duan: I think you're cut",
    "ting in and out for me. Still, wait. Okay, now you're back. 39 00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.410 Jenny Duan: Can you repeat what you just said? 40 00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.430 huda: Oh, wait! Did I cut up. 41 00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.195 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you just dropped, and now you're back. But I think you're 42 00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.020 Jenny Duan: still cutting in and out for me. 43 00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.360 Jenny Duan: Hey, Sarajeh? 44 00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.190 Jenny Duan: Yes. 45 00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:36.551 Siraj Nazir: Hi, I'm I'm actually joining in my desk computer because mine isn't like working. For some reason. 46 00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.047 Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. Glad that you were able to make it back. 47 00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:48.090 Jenny Duan: okay. So just to pick up our conversation, I think that we 48 00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.409 Jenny Duan: would 49 00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:00.909 Jenny Duan: like. Let's continue talking about the Uc schools. So what schools are you interested in? I think we talked about this before. But just to confirm. You see, Berkeley, ucla uc Irvine. 50 00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:10.869 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. So uc, Berkeley, uc, Davis, uc irvine ucla maybe just uc riverside as a backup. 51 00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.186 Siraj Nazir: and then 52 00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:20.555 Siraj Nazir: you, I guess. You see, San Diego, I think I might have to do a little research on like what metered do there and then. 53 00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.070 Siraj Nazir: uc Santa Cruz. 54 00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.199 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's look at the majors right now. Actually. 55 00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.290 Jenny Duan: so 56 00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.359 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna go on their website and look at their majors. 57 00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.570 Jenny Duan: okay. 58 00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.950 Jenny Duan: majors within the CS. 59 00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.453 Jenny Duan: They have 60 00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.311 Jenn",
    "y Duan: computer science. Obviously, let's see if they have media studies. 61 00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.060 Jenny Duan: hey? 62 00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.310 Siraj Nazir: They have visual arts, media. 63 00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.719 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's that's like an art degree. I don't know if that's what you're looking for. 64 00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.550 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 65 00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.753 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think they would have just like a general computer science major. 66 00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.959 Jenny Duan: or they have cognitive sciences if you're interested in that. But I think. 67 00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:26.670 Jenny Duan: Do any of these majors interest you? 68 00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:33.520 Siraj Nazir: I think cognitive science, if they have like some sort of I know. 69 00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:38.189 Siraj Nazir: for for some of the colleges that I looked at I think it was 70 00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.550 Siraj Nazir: owned 71 00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:48.419 Siraj Nazir: one of the majors I looked at there was like cognitive side. So like focus on 72 00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.540 Siraj Nazir: like media arts or something. 73 00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.159 Siraj Nazir: I don't know if that's the correct or it was a focus on computer science or something like that. 74 00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:01.430 Jenny Duan: I have a cognitive science with a focus on machine learning and neural computation. 75 00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.640 Jenny Duan: What do you think. 76 00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.490 Siraj Nazir: I think, yeah, I think that's something I'd be interested in. 77 00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.719 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool and then 78 00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.200 Jenny Duan: I think. 79 00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:17.090 Jenny Duan: okay, so would Ucsd be a a school that you want to go to 80 00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:24.929 Jenny Duan: cause. If it's not. Then, I think, like there's no point to go. But if you, if you would want to go there,",
    " then obviously 81 00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.300 Jenny Duan: it would be good. 82 00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.539 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I mean, I think if I got in then I'd definitely love to go. 83 00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:30.960 Jenny Duan: Okay? 84 00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.109 Jenny Duan: Then let's put that down 85 00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.860 Jenny Duan: on the other side 86 00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.719 Jenny Duan: for the other schools. Do you know what, Major? You wanna apply to. 87 00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.319 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. So for Irvine, I wanna do interactive media and game design. 88 00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.960 Jenny Duan: Great. Would you be able to add this to the notion? 89 00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.220 Jenny Duan: Do you see where I'm typing right now? I don't know if you can see, actually live updates on notion. 90 00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.100 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I don't think I can. 91 00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.380 Siraj Nazir: Is it like the major list? 92 00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.190 Jenny Duan: No, I'm typing. 93 00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.840 Jenny Duan: Maybe that would actually be a better place to add it. 94 00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:16.529 Jenny Duan: I'm just typing it in the Uc. Application. But I think. Let me add it to the major list. That would probably be better. 95 00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.400 Jenny Duan: Okay. You see, San Diego would be like cognitive signs. 96 00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.550 Jenny Duan: Let me see, is this the Ps or BA, 97 00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.980 Jenny Duan: BS, okay. 98 00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.639 Jenny Duan: okay. Do you see where I added it. 99 00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:48.949 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I can see it. 100 00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.710 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 101 00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.699 Jenny Duan: It's not a, it's not a selective status major. So it should be okay. 102 00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.600 Siraj Nazir: Hmm. 103 00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.834 Siraj Nazir: okay, and then for Irvine, ther",
    "e's a major. 104 00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.550 Jenny Duan: You said you said a school before San Diego. What was the other school. 105 00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.756 Siraj Nazir: I think. Did I say? 106 00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:14.100 Siraj Nazir: Davis? Yeah. 107 00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:16.400 Jenny Duan: No! What was Davis's again. 108 00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:19.889 Siraj Nazir: Davis was also cognitive science. I think. 109 00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.740 Jenny Duan: With a specialization in. 110 00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.479 Siraj Nazir: Let me look into that actually. 111 00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.019 Siraj Nazir: I don't know if they have that. 112 00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.770 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 113 00:23:52.793 --> 00:23:53.919 Siraj Nazir: Maybe like 114 00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.930 Siraj Nazir: they 115 00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:02.290 Siraj Nazir: show like logic for artificial intelligence. But I'm not sure if that's like a specialization. 116 00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.840 Jenny Duan: Okay, is that a specialization in cognitive science. 117 00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:18.649 Siraj Nazir: There's there's a yeah. There's a major in cognitive science. Which is a Bs, and then there's a computational emphasis. And then that's like 118 00:24:19.286 --> 00:24:20.220 Siraj Nazir: more about 119 00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.979 Siraj Nazir: like coding, and everything. 120 00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. So so for Uc. Davis, it's Bs come to signs with the computation emphasis. 121 00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.090 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 122 00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.940 Jenny Duan: Okay, and what about Irvine? 123 00:24:30.985 --> 00:24:32.925 Siraj Nazir: So there's a major 124 00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:38.419 Siraj Nazir: game. There's a BS called game design and interactive media. 125 00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:38.949 Jenny Duan: Okay. 126 00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.440 Jenny Duan: That's like a Really, that's like a perfect major for you. 127 00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.825 Siraj",
    " Nazir: Yeah. 128 00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.840 Siraj Nazir: yeah. I don't think there's any focuses on this one. 129 00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.850 Jenny Duan: Okay. 130 00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:54.819 Siraj Nazir: But yeah. 131 00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.716 Siraj Nazir: and then 132 00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.030 Jenny Duan: What are the other schools? So the other Uc schools. 133 00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.549 Siraj Nazir: So for Berkeley, I wanted to do 134 00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.520 Siraj Nazir: media studies with a focus on. 135 00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.940 Jenny Duan: Fba. Or Bs. 136 00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:18.806 Siraj Nazir: Let me check again. 137 00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.100 Jenny Duan: No worries. 138 00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.883 Siraj Nazir: Actually, I'm not sure. 139 00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.289 Siraj Nazir: wait. I'm not sure if it's a BS or B 140 00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.660 Siraj Nazir: home. 141 00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.570 Jenny Duan: Let me look it up really quickly. 142 00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.329 Jenny Duan: What is the major name? Can you repeat that one more time. 143 00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.779 Siraj Nazir: Media studies. 144 00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.439 Jenny Duan: I think it's probably a BA 145 00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.150 Jenny Duan: Erm, ly. 146 00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.749 Jenny Duan: BA. Okay. 147 00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.110 Jenny Duan: Okay, what about Uc riverside? 148 00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.720 Siraj Nazir: Let me check what? Major. 149 00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.740 Jenny Duan: Okay. Cool. 150 00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.680 Siraj Nazir: Hmm. 151 00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:44.119 Siraj Nazir: maybe data science. I'm not sure if they have anything similar to cognitive science or 152 00:27:44.709 --> 00:27:51.189 Siraj Nazir: yeah, I don't see anything of a sort, and I don't really want to do media studies. If I do end up going here. 153 00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, so do you. Wanna remove Uc. Riverside fr",
    "om the list. Then. 154 00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.944 Siraj Nazir: I kinda wanna have it as a safety, but 155 00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.989 Jenny Duan: You wanna apply computer science. 156 00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.820 Siraj Nazir: I feel like, I prefer data science over computer science. 157 00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.215 Jenny Duan: Okay. 158 00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.399 Jenny Duan: then let me add data. Science. Then. 159 00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.820 Jenny Duan: okay, what about Santa Cruz? 160 00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.910 Siraj Nazir: I think. And I've heard of like a good game development program there. So 161 00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.310 Siraj Nazir: hmm. 162 00:28:50.745 --> 00:28:52.375 Siraj Nazir: okay, there's 163 00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.100 Siraj Nazir: There's 164 00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.019 Siraj Nazir: yeah. I think I'll do one which is like a Bs and 165 00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.250 Siraj Nazir: computer science computer game design. 166 00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.940 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay. 167 00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.220 Jenny Duan: let me write that down. 168 00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:13.679 Siraj Nazir: Options. There's there's a art and design games and playable media. But I think that's a BA 169 00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.399 Jenny Duan: So is there? You said, there's Bs computer science game design. 170 00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.310 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 171 00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.593 Jenny Duan: Oh, that seems like a really good 172 00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:24.610 Jenny Duan: idea! 173 00:29:27.445 --> 00:29:27.940 Siraj Nazir: Hmm. 174 00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.665 Jenny Duan: okay? And then what about 175 00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.919 Jenny Duan: Uc, is that everything? Ucla. 176 00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.319 Siraj Nazir: I don't really have anything for game 177 00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.800 Siraj Nazir: on development. 178 00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:11.529 Siraj Nazir: but they I think they do have something for media. But I know that's like ",
    "kind of 179 00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.160 Siraj Nazir: more competitive for 180 00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.930 Siraj Nazir: Ucla. Yes. 181 00:30:18.945 --> 00:30:19.610 Siraj Nazir: e. 182 00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.629 Siraj Nazir: Maybe I could also try to do cognitive science here. I'm not sure. 183 00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:40.729 Jenny Duan: Okay, think about what I think would be best to figure out like what would be best for you, not what is least competitive in this case, cause, I think, like game design. Do you think the game design, major is going to be super competitive? Is that your concern. 184 00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.988 Siraj Nazir: They don't have a game design. They they just have like media arts, and I think 185 00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.410 Siraj Nazir: a lot more a lot more like design 186 00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.770 Siraj Nazir: oriented than the other schools. 187 00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.429 Jenny Duan: Would you rather do the more designed one? Or would you rather do like the computer science? One. 188 00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:04.750 Siraj Nazir: I think I'd rather like focus more on computer science, maybe, cause that's a little I know a little more about that. 189 00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.389 Jenny Duan: So for Ucla, would you want to do computer science or data science. 190 00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.345 Siraj Nazir: I was thinking like, maybe since 191 00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:19.660 Siraj Nazir: I've been doing like cognitive science for the other schools. It will be best for this one as well. 192 00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.591 Jenny Duan: Okay, then, maybe data science or cognitive science. 193 00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.360 Jenny Duan: Then, like, we can apply it to like 194 00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.220 Jenny Duan: cognitive science. And then data science as a second 195 00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:32.480 Jenny Duan: like, you know, when they have the list. 196 00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:43.770 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think I don't know. I think that c",
    "ognitive science if they have like like a focus on kind of computing, then maybe that will be perfect. But. 197 00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.040 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me let's research that right now. 198 00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.100 Jenny Duan: key. 199 00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.209 Jenny Duan: it doesn't look like they. It's in the department of psychology. 200 00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:08.270 Jenny Duan: I don't know if they have a like concentration. 201 00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.890 Jenny Duan: But it's just the code it assigns, Major. 202 00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.290 Jenny Duan: if that's what you're interested in. 203 00:32:15.189 --> 00:32:18.019 Siraj Nazir: I think this is definitely like a lot more 204 00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:25.579 Siraj Nazir: philosophical. So maybe maybe data science would be better than this. 205 00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.820 Jenny Duan: Okay, that seems good. Then. 206 00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.520 Jenny Duan: okay. 207 00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:40.720 Jenny Duan: I think that's let me see, that's it for all the Uc schools. So 208 00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:47.859 Jenny Duan: now that we have all of these schools. I think that looking at your college list, it would be nice to add a couple of more safety schools. 209 00:32:48.177 --> 00:32:52.782 Jenny Duan: I know that we've kind of discussed this in the past. So are there any 210 00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.049 Jenny Duan: Let me let me look at our list and see like what other schools we've identified for you. 211 00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.420 Jenny Duan: yeah, I do think it'd be nice to add a couple more safety schools, because I feel like this is a pretty 212 00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:13.449 Jenny Duan: tough list so far. Are there any other schools that you would want to consider applying to in California or outside California, too? 213 00:33:14.673 --> 00:33:17.660 Siraj Nazir: I was seeing maybe cal quality, slow. 214 00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:23.295 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think, okay. Cal, Poly, Sl",
    "ow is a good school. I still don't know if that's a safety school. 215 00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:33.859 Jenny Duan: well, yeah, I don't think it's a safety school. I'm gonna say, maybe match let's do regular decision. And then what, Major, would you want to do in poly slow. 216 00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:35.899 Siraj Nazir: Let me check. 217 00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:38.540 Jenny Duan: Okay. I'm also gonna look at the list. 218 00:33:39.916 --> 00:33:42.609 Siraj Nazir: They actually do have a game development program. 219 00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:47.540 Siraj Nazir: So either I can see if they have anything else. 220 00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.190 Jenny Duan: Okay. Awesome. 221 00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:52.069 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think. The game development? 222 00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.910 Siraj Nazir: oh, yeah. And you get to do a lot of like artificial intelligence and everything as well. 223 00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.757 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that seems 224 00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.279 Jenny Duan: that seems good to me. 225 00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.390 Jenny Duan: Let's add that 226 00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.440 Jenny Duan: is, it Bs game development. 227 00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.829 Siraj Nazir: I think it's actually a concentration for computer science. 228 00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.909 Jenny Duan: Okay, that's not. That's not bad, either. That's fine. 229 00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.470 Siraj Nazir: So it's a Bs computer science with a concentration in 230 00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.580 Siraj Nazir: concentration and video game. 231 00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.679 Siraj Nazir: Bye. 232 00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:49.989 Jenny Duan: Let's see how many schools this is, or how many applications. 12345678910. I think we can add, like 233 00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.350 Jenny Duan: maybe 234 00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.309 Jenny Duan: 2, to like 5 more, 2 to 5 more schools. 235 00:34:57.277 --> 00:35:05.910 Jenny Duan: I know it sounds like a lot of schools, but it's just because the Uc appl",
    "ication is is one application for so many schools. That I think it's fine. 236 00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.360 Jenny Duan: what other schools do you think you might be interested in. 237 00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.873 Siraj Nazir: I mean, I think, as a safety, maybe. 238 00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.000 Siraj Nazir: csu Fullerton. 239 00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:31.310 Jenny Duan: Okay, Csu F, and then what school? I mean? What major with it? See with Csu F. 240 00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.090 Siraj Nazir: Let me check. 241 00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.270 Siraj Nazir: Hmm! 242 00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.169 Siraj Nazir: I'm not sure if there's any features for game development. 243 00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.919 Siraj Nazir: Oh, there's signs, though. 244 00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.680 Jenny Duan: There is computer science. 245 00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.300 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 246 00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.890 Jenny Duan: Alright. Let's just add that. And then. 247 00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.790 Jenny Duan: are there any other schools that you think you might be interested in. 248 00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.650 Siraj Nazir: You see if there's any other new csus. 249 00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.719 Siraj Nazir: maybe Csu Long Beach. 250 00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:15.072 Jenny Duan: Okay, would you be genuinely interested to going to to going to this school. 251 00:37:17.086 --> 00:37:18.419 Siraj Nazir: Not really. 252 00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.320 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's not add it. Then what about Csu F. 253 00:37:23.075 --> 00:37:28.079 Siraj Nazir: Csuf. I feel like it's kind of far, I mean, like. 254 00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:36.230 Siraj Nazir: honestly, I think if I weren't to get into like my my top Ucs. I'd probably go to community college and try to do the tag program 255 00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.380 Siraj Nazir: and then. 256 00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:51.089 Jenny Duan: Okay, then let's so. Would you be interested in applying to see to Csu F. Then, if you like to, I think if you don't th",
    "ink you would want to go there. Then let's take it off the list. But what about Cal Poly? Slow? Would you be interested in going to Cal Poly. 257 00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.619 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, I think that actually be interesting going there. 258 00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:58.590 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's see, like what other schools might be a good fit for you that have, like 259 00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.520 Jenny Duan: less competitive 260 00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.739 Jenny Duan: programs that you would still want to go to 261 00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.780 Jenny Duan: See? 262 00:38:16.016 --> 00:38:18.760 Jenny Duan: What about Georgia? Tech. 263 00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.070 Siraj Nazir: Oh, I thought that was kind of more competitive. 264 00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.110 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's actually, it's more competitive. But 265 00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.259 Jenny Duan: okay, what about Rochester Institute of Technology? Have you heard of that? 266 00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.650 Siraj Nazir: Oh, I haven't. 267 00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.945 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's in Rochester, New York. 268 00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.470 Jenny Duan: they have, like a pretty good 269 00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.649 Jenny Duan: sales made game design major program. 270 00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.020 Jenny Duan: let me write it. Let me give you their website. 271 00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.750 Jenny Duan: None. 272 00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:55.296 Jenny Duan: And I think you could look into this. But I don't know if you would want to go into the 273 00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.070 Jenny Duan: into the east coast. But 274 00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.700 Jenny Duan: this is one option that we can consider. 275 00:39:04.382 --> 00:39:13.350 Siraj Nazir: I think I think that'd be interested in applying. I think it's definitely worth looking at it. If they have a good game development. 276 00:39:14.705 --> 00:39:15.440 Siraj Nazir: program. 277 00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:22.237 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. L",
    "et's just write it down. It's in upstate New York. That's the only thing like, I don't know if you would want to. 278 00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.580 Jenny Duan: If you're okay with that, then 279 00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.050 Jenny Duan: that's fine. 280 00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.740 Siraj Nazir: I think like if I have to. I I probably would. 281 00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, okay, let me add it down. Then 282 00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.220 Jenny Duan: Rochester 283 00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.540 Jenny Duan: Institute 284 00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.849 Jenny Duan: of Technology. Let's say it's the safety. And then say, regular decision. 285 00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:55.029 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Same design and development. Okay, I think this is enough safety schools. I don't think that you need more safety schools. But are there any other just general schools that you would be interested in applying to. 286 00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:03.189 Siraj Nazir: I'm I'm not sure. I think I think that's all for now. 287 00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.520 Siraj Nazir: Okay. 288 00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:11.300 Jenny Duan: So then, that means like about 11 applications. Total does. Is that feeling good for you? 289 00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.139 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, is that a law or. 290 00:40:13.833 --> 00:40:18.386 Jenny Duan: No, it's it's it's actually I feel like on the lower end for most people. 291 00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:25.740 Jenny Duan: But I don't think that's like a bad thing like, I think that this is a this is a good amount, and I think that you 292 00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.670 Jenny Duan: have a really impressive profile at this point. So I feel like. 293 00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:33.140 Jenny Duan: you know, it's not gonna be an issue. 294 00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.300 Jenny Duan: yeah. Do you have any 295 00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.669 Jenny Duan: like questions or anything else that you would want to add to this list? 296 00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:58.320 Siraj Nazir: No, I ",
    "think I think this is like a good list, and if like maybe say, say, I get like rejected from all these. I think it's like it's fine, cause I'd probably just be able to do the tag program. 297 00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:14.670 Jenny Duan: Well, I don't think you're gonna get rejected for all of these, or that's that's like, ideally, ideally. Not. So let's not think that way. But being in California, you're right that the community college program is good. But I think that you know, you have a really strong profile, and we're like working on, strengthening it even more still. And so I think 298 00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.780 Jenny Duan: there shouldn't be an issue here. 299 00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.810 Siraj Nazir: Okay. 300 00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.030 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 301 00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.460 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 302 00:41:21.963 --> 00:41:28.649 Jenny Duan: Any just double checking anything else that you would wanna add, or do you? Do you feel comfortable with, how this is? 303 00:41:29.457 --> 00:41:33.120 Siraj Nazir: I can maybe do some like research. Like 304 00:41:33.723 --> 00:41:41.050 Siraj Nazir: see if there's any other colleges that I'd be interested in applying to, but for now I think this list is looking pretty good. 305 00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.369 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds good to me. 306 00:41:43.757 --> 00:41:56.640 Jenny Duan: So now I think our next step should be to take a look at your common app essay and start like brainstorming and thinking about this. I I do think, however, that, like common app. 307 00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:01.710 Jenny Duan: actually, I think it might be better to wait till August for the common Fsa. Because 308 00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:12.870 Jenny Duan: I want to have the opportunity to build off of your experiences from the summer into your essay. So I think that we can actually leave this to the end of summer and start this in August. 309 00:42:13.365 --> 00:42:16.450 Jenny Duan: So I don't think that that's",
    " like a 310 00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.250 Jenny Duan: going to be a concern. 311 00:42:18.658 --> 00:42:33.360 Jenny Duan: I think that once, now that we have the college list settled in the major list settled, I feel pretty comfortable with the rest of your like college major list document. For now do you have any concerns that you would want to address right now in regards to this list? 312 00:42:34.769 --> 00:42:46.920 Siraj Nazir: not regarding the list. But if we could probably like maybe right now, if we could focus on maybe some scholarships to apply to, since I think that's kind of the next step to do this summer. 313 00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:52.680 Jenny Duan: Definitely. Actually, why don't we start a new tab here? That's like a scholarship planning list? 314 00:42:53.064 --> 00:42:55.069 Jenny Duan: How do you feel about that? 315 00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.969 Siraj Nazir: Yeah, that's great. I think that'd be helpful. 316 00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:02.300 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's see. Well, you did. You customize this? It looks really good. 317 00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.790 Jenny Duan: like all of this. 318 00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.700 Siraj Nazir: Oh, I think like my dad got like 319 00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.010 Jenny Duan: The template. 320 00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:08.670 Siraj Nazir: Yeah. 321 00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.410 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it looks. It looks really good. Okay. 322 00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:18.839 Jenny Duan: let's, I'm gonna make a new untitled. And 323 00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.580 Jenny Duan: I want to build you a tracker. But I feel like. 324 00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:27.330 Jenny Duan: so so, okay, how do I talk? Okay, I'm just gonna duplicate this call 325 00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.349 Jenny Duan: college and majors list 326 00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:32.919 Jenny Duan: and just say, who does scholarship list 327 00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:35.860 Jenny Duan: on. 328 00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:45.480 Jenny Duan: You see this on who does?

It's just called who does scholarship list. 331 00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.570 Siraj Nazir: Oh, yeah, I see it. 332 00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.290 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. 333 00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.340 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna delete this table 334 00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:08.880 Jenny Duan: and 335 00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.459 Jenny Duan: rename.

Okay. 632 01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.430 Jenny Duan: I also wonder if, like California 633 01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.780 Jenny Duan: Californian students. 634 01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:47.550 Jenny Duan: me 635 01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.650 Jenny Duan: stay 636 01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:40.079 Jenny Duan: I'm looking for specific California scholarships right now. 637 01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:45.160 Siraj Nazir: There's a Cal Grant award.

There's things you can do to like. 649 01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:17.690 Jenny Duan: Try to get your adjusted gross income as low as possible in order to like, be more eligible for scholarships 650 01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:22.540 Jenny Duan: and benefits for that. But t",
    "hat's something I'll talk to your dad about, and I think 651 01:20:23.115 --> 01:20:25.180 Jenny Duan: like you'd have to worry about that. 652 01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:28.000 Jenny Duan: let's see. 653 01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:30.710 Jenny Duan: I feel like. 654 01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:34.380 Jenny Duan: or 655 01:20:35.650 --> 01:20:36.870 Jenny Duan: family. 656 01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.970 Jenny Duan: California Credit Union. 657 01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.370 Jenny Duan: see. 658 01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.789 Jenny Duan: there's just so many scholarships out there that, like. 659 01:20:54.810 --> 01:21:00.720 Jenny Duan: it's all about finding and and identifying the ones that are best fit for you. 660 01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:02.380 Jenny Duan: like basically as 661 01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.850 Jenny Duan: specific as possible 662 01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:07.420 Jenny Duan: to you. 663 01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:08.980 Siraj Nazir: Hmm 664 01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.699 Jenny Duan: What, Tony, are you?

Okay, I just added a couple more. 674 01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.580 Jenny Duan: I think that if you want to. 675 01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.020 Jenny Duan: I've been like 676 01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:21.720 Jenny Duan: peering through this list. 677 01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.999 Jenny Duan: You don",
    "'t have to spend too much time pairing through this list, but it's like a good start 678 01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.450 Jenny Duan: for California scholarships. 679 01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:38.946 Jenny Duan: And I think but I do think that right now, since we already have like almost 25 scholarships, we can just start here. 680 01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:40.900 Jenny Duan: and 681 01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.010 Jenny Duan: let's see, go from here. 682 01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.449 Jenny Duan: PGNE. I just found one more. I just want to add 683 01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:50.590 Jenny Duan: ship 684 01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.019 Jenny Duan: better together.

I think this is like a good start for us, and then once we start filling out these applications, we'll like like in newsletters and things. We'll hear more and more on the way. 687 01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.659 Jenny Duan: I think you're muted. 688 01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:35.439 Siraj Nazir: So for for these scholarships, these are kind of things that we're gonna be doing. That I'm gonna be working on next summer or not next summer, but maybe, like next winter, slash, spring. 689 01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.500 Jenny Duan: More like fall, slash, winter, slash, spring. 690 01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:40.460 Siraj Nazir: Oh! This full. 691 01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:41.610 Jenny Duan: This fall.

I kinda thought I thought it was this summer. But. 697 01:23:54.392 --> 01:24:06.090 Jenny Duan: It's some of them like I don't. I think most of them open it somewhere from",
    " the fall to the spring around the same time as the other Scott as the college applications, and like a little bit after the 698 01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.659 Jenny Duan: the college application season. 699 01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.259 Siraj Nazir: Okay, that makes sense. 700 01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:13.010 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Any other questions. 701 01:24:13.918 --> 01:24:15.589 Siraj Nazir: No, that's all for this week. 702 01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:28.350 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool do you have a focus that you wanted to work on next time?

But is it. 703 01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.990 Siraj Nazir: I think. 704 01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.640 Jenny Duan: Big. 705 01:24:29.977 --> 01:24:43.119 Siraj Nazir: I think we could probably like check back in with kind of scaling. Maybe and I could like give you an update on how like the action items are going. And then as well as 706 01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.259 Siraj Nazir: kind of how to like. 707 01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.379 Siraj Nazir: I guess, like market to things that I've been doing 708 01:24:48.982 --> 01:24:55.290 Siraj Nazir: well, like all my extra curriculars, for like. So they're like the strongest extra curriculas, for when I'm applying. 709 01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:58.009 Jenny Duan: Okay, sounds good. We'll talk about that next time.
