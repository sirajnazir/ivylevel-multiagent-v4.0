Sorry for joining late. I I just got home from school, so I forgot about the call. 4 00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.550 Jenny Duan: Hi! No worries! How's it going. 5 00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.252 huda s: It's going well, how are you? 6 00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:33.995 Jenny Duan: Doing well, too good to see you. Let's just get started. I think we're already running a little behind. So let's just get started. 7 00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:40.020 Jenny Duan: first of all, did you get any of the text that I sent you about? Sending the update to your teacher for J. Camp? 8 00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.890 huda s: oh, yeah, I just I just saw that. Yeah. 9 00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:54.370 Jenny Duan: Okay, did. Do you wanna draft like a quick email? Or do you wanna tell them in person? Maybe cause I feel like. 10 00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.230 Jenny Duan: now it's definitely good to give them an update about your progress. 11 00:11:59.215 --> 00:12:04.740 huda s: Maybe in person. I don't think they I don't think he responds to emails that much. 12 00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:13.159 Jenny Duan: Oh, right, it's this teacher. Oh, my goodness, okay. Well, be sure to tell him in person. I'm sure he'll be really happy to hear the news? 13 00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.999 Jenny Duan: okay. Awesome. 14 00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:32.690 Jenny Duan: next. The other thing is, did you see this breakthrough Junior challenge that I sent you? We could also take a look at that right now. I don't have. We talked about this in the past. There's a chance that I've already brought it up, but I'm not sure if I have. 15 00:12:33.088 --> 00:12:35.079 huda s: I don't think we have. 16 00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:43.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's take a look at this. So this is on a challenge called Breakthrough. It's run by an academy. 17 00:12:43.715 --> 00:12:49.184 Jenny Duan: And if you win this. It's like a big scholarship. But it's 18 00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.670 Jenny Duan: I think it's a 2 min video about 19 00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:57.760 Jenny Duan: anything like science? A science topic. 20 00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:09.490 Jenny Duan: yeah, yours. You're submitting an original video 2 min that brings to life a concept or theory in the life sciences, physics, or mathematics. So it's about science communication. 21 00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:19.250 Jenny Duan: and if you win, you get like $100,000. Your school gets money like you get money for a lab like, it's it's a very big project. 22 00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.250 Jenny Duan: And 23 00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.260 Jenny Duan: yeah. 24 00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:34.939 Jenny Duan: so I think that you could, you could definitely be eligible for this and I think that you could make like a really good video, since you already do a lot of like science communication type of work. 25 00:13:36.084 --> 00:13:42.119 huda s: For science communication like, what does that specifically mean? Like, so 26 00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.416 huda s: this, could it be including like computer science? Or is it just kind of. 27 00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.269 Jenny Duan: No, I think life, sciences, physics, or mathematics. 28 00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.670 Jenny Duan: Let's look at some of the previous winners 29 00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.519 Jenny Duan: my friends was. She's from Mauritius, like the country. 30 00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.189 Jenny Duan: But let me show you hers. 31 00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.570 Jenny Duan: look. Okay, let me show you. Let me share my screen. Can see this as well. 32 00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.120 Jenny Duan: Golf. 33 00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:35.190 Jenny Duan: Can you see this. 34 00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.509 Jenny Duan: Okay, so it's positively charged. And this one has a negative charge close together. 35 00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:49.559 huda s: They attract. That's no surprise. But what if they weren't charged on neutral objects? Could they still attract each other? 36 00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.050 huda s: Do 37 00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.420 huda s: they actually can. But if you're thinking 38 00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.669 huda s: that's impossible, let's change perspectives and take a look closer 39 00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:17.810 huda s: me through the atomic and molecular worlds where negative electrons and positive nucleus rate, their charges cancel to 0 when they form atoms, atoms from molecules, and these particles build pretty much everything around us. But even with 0 charge, these particles can attract. 40 00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:32.099 huda s: How well, think about this molecule as a school. When the electron students play catch outside, they constantly, randomly move around the nucleus campus, keeping overall charge 0 with their random movement, can result in more electrons found on one side than the other. 41 00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:53.910 huda s: This electron heavy area takes a temporary, small or partial negative charge, and the other a positive one. Surrounding molecules can induce. Into this trend, and since opposite charges attract the molecules, get pulled together. We call these fender vowels, forces correctly aligned for closed neutral surfaces together. That's how Geckos climbed the walls, and how engineers created these amazing Geffel clows 42 00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:13.610 huda s: whoa so thunder vowels forces allow neutral objects to attract. But guess what? There's another way this can happen, explained by the Casmia effect in the quantum world, and the quantum world is pretty weird. This particle also behaves like a wave, and waves have different wavelengths. Now watch what happens when I place these 2 boats in this area full of waves. 43 00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:39.329 huda s: You can see that waves of all wavelengths hit their bose from outside, but only some fit between more waves means greater forces exerted on their Bose from outside than between. So the boats get pushed together. Now let's apply this knowledge to the Casmir effect. If we create what we would think as empty space, a vacuum removing all matter and reducing energy to minimum. There are still virtual particles and antiparticles that pop PIN in pairs and annulate out of existence. 44 00:16:39.330 --> 00:17:04.299 huda s: When we place these 2 neutral metal plates parallel and close together, the plates act as mirrors for virtual photons, virtual particles of light, virtual photons of all wavelength sparks off the plates from outside, where only those whose wavelengths fit a whole number of times into the gap bounce between, like we saw in the boats. More virtual photons means. A greater force is exerted on the plates from outside and between. So the plates get pushed together. That's how Lecasmia force allows 45 00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.690 huda s: surfaces to attract 46 00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:33.319 huda s: the worst to use. Will ever wanted your computer lighter and faster. Yeah, smaller and more powerful. Nano Chips could be the answer. But at such small scale the Casimir force attracts the components inside, making these innovations more difficult. So you see whether we notice it or not, we're surrounded by strange phenomena capable of explaining seemingly absurd ideas. So whatever the situation, if something seems impossible, change perspectives, take a step closer or further and 47 00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.190 huda s: find a way to make that impossible possible. 48 00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.726 huda s: That's cool. 49 00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:40.980 Jenny Duan: Think. 50 00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:47.611 huda s: I think it's really I think it's kind of complicated like to be honest. I don't 51 00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:54.760 huda s: know much about like sciences. So maybe I won't be able to do something as complex as that. But 52 00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.929 huda s: yeah, I was pretty. 53 00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.200 Jenny Duan: You can also do it about science. You can also do it about 54 00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:12.330 Jenny Duan: life, about mathematics, life, sciences, fundamental physics. And also yours is gonna be only 2 min. Hers is 3 min, but the limit this year is only 2 min. 55 00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.599 Jenny Duan: So, but I feel like you'll have enough time to like, learn about, concept and explain it. 56 00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.440 huda s: Yeah. 57 00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:28.610 Jenny Duan: In detail. I think the primary thing is just not the concept itself, but like how well you explain it, and also the level of editing that you use cause like I think her editing was really good. 58 00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.390 huda s: Yeah. 59 00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:34.450 Jenny Duan: Like that probably contributed to her win. But I feel like you're good at editing, too, so that shouldn't be a problem. 60 00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:43.284 huda s: Yeah, hopefully, so maybe I could probably do something. Maybe more based around math. 61 00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.220 huda s: And 62 00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.370 huda s: I can explain. 63 00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.300 huda s: maybe like 64 00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.399 huda s: something like derivatives, or something like that. 65 00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:04.263 Jenny Duan: I think that they're probably looking for something more complicated. So when they say, math, you're probably gonna have to do something like pretty theoretical, or something like a lot different. 66 00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:15.479 Jenny Duan: cause. I think that like there, you're being judged for how well you can explain a difficult concept in an easy to understand way, but, like the concept itself, still has to be like relatively difficult. 67 00:19:16.074 --> 00:19:20.089 huda s: Okay, I, I can do some brainstorming on that, maybe, then. 68 00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.264 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. And also that it doesn't start until 69 00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.440 Jenny Duan: Let's see, when the 70 00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.600 Jenny Duan: okay applications open. April and the submission deadline is June 20 fifth. 71 00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:48.080 Jenny Duan: So that's like some context for the timeline. So just opened, you have about 2 months until June 20 fifth to brainstorm and think about what you want to write about. So I'm gonna make a note of that. And like, next time we meet, we could talk about some potential ideas. And I think 72 00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:57.390 Jenny Duan: the more complicated the topic is, the better, because and then the better job at explaining you do of the difficult topic the better. So 73 00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:11.940 Jenny Duan: you don't have to choose like the hardest topic in the world as long as something you feel confident, explaining cause. That's ultimately the the goal. But I do feel like if you do something that relatively, people have a hard time understanding, which is, gonna be hard things. It's gonna pay off. 74 00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.600 Jenny Duan: Pat. 75 00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.899 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me make a note of that 76 00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.490 Jenny Duan: and 77 00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.060 Jenny Duan: due. It's due. June 24, June 2024. 78 00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.559 Jenny Duan: So let's make sure. June 20, fifth, 2024 is when it's due. 79 00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.816 Jenny Duan: And then that is another another thing that reminds me of this scholarship that 80 00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.759 Jenny Duan: we're not. We haven't even begun the timeline for. But I do just want to send this to you. 81 00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.850 Jenny Duan: 1 s. 82 00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.489 Jenny Duan: okay. And then, if you want to take a look at this link I'm putting in the chat. 83 00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:06.410 Jenny Duan: This is another scholarship that I feel like you should apply for. 84 00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.074 Jenny Duan: This one is 85 00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.799 Jenny Duan: going to be a 3 min video 86 00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:17.529 Jenny Duan: about a stem topic that you're passionate about. 87 00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:26.430 Jenny Duan: I think this can be any stem topic. So this one includes computer science and one of the previous winners was a computer science 88 00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.650 Jenny Duan: person. 89 00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.510 Jenny Duan: yeah. 90 00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.430 Jenny Duan: So I think this is another good opportunity. And if you win this, this is a full scholarship to college. 91 00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.830 huda s: So. 92 00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 4 years like fully paid for if you win. 93 00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.920 Jenny Duan: So. 94 00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:50.799 huda s: Oh, that's really cool. I think this one like maybe it could be nice to talk about like AI ethics. Maybe. 95 00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah. But I feel like it. Should, you should focus on the stem part. So maybe, like. 96 00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:06.370 Jenny Duan: how like machine learning algorithms, how like the different machine learning algorithms work. And like, I think ethics shouldn't be a part of it. But I feel like they want you to. If I think it's the same thing as the breakthrough thing where they want you to. 97 00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.869 Jenny Duan: they want you to explain a very crazy topic in in in an interesting way. 98 00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.495 Jenny Duan: So 99 00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:23.759 Jenny Duan: for example, in this one, you can look at the previous winners and like, look at their videos. But they're all pretty technical. 100 00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.050 Jenny Duan: This well. 101 00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.980 huda s: Okay. 102 00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.185 Jenny Duan: But as we transition to 103 00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.610 Jenny Duan: the summer, we're gonna start like 104 00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:53.299 Jenny Duan: camera impact is just the start. But like we're gonna go into awards mode. So like we recently just been in like summer application mode. But we're gonna start going into like awards and scholarships mode, because that's gonna be taking up 105 00:22:53.300 --> 00:23:15.749 Jenny Duan: like I fully anticipate you would apply for like 20 or 30 scholarships, and I wanna get as much of your college paid for as possible. So I think you have a good chance of winning a lot of scholarships, and I don't wanna miss out on any of them. So this is just a preview. I have like lots more in the pocket. So better get used to writing. Why, why do I want this scholarship? Why, I think I'm gonna be a good fit, because that's gonna be your life for the next like 106 00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.010 Jenny Duan: 10 months. 107 00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.300 Jenny Duan: also college implications, but likes. 108 00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.250 huda s: Reference, too. 109 00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:31.490 Jenny Duan: okay, so make a note. Okay. So back to the original topic, make a note to talk to your journalism, teacher about the letter of Reg 110 00:23:32.251 --> 00:23:35.208 Jenny Duan: or about receiving the program 111 00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.150 Jenny Duan: and then you haven't run any updates from any other programs. Have you. 112 00:23:41.457 --> 00:23:42.379 huda s: No, I haven't. 113 00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.222 Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. 114 00:23:44.955 --> 00:23:49.080 Jenny Duan: Apple engineering camp. Were you able to submit your application there. 115 00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.719 huda s: Oh, I haven't actually 116 00:23:52.457 --> 00:23:58.682 huda s: oh, yeah, I did have an update about games for change. I was able to submit that one. 117 00:23:59.010 --> 00:23:59.580 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 118 00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.399 huda s: And the weekend, and. 119 00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.289 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing thanks. So much. 120 00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:12.160 Jenny Duan: Also, thanks for staying on top of the deadlines. I'm sorry about the Regan Leadership Award deadline. I think I'll try to be more visual of the deadlines, too, in the future. 121 00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.610 huda s: No, that's okay. I think I should have checked as well. 122 00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:29.268 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like it's okay. The good thing about apply the good and bad thing about applying to a ton of things is. Well, the good thing is, if you miss one, there's always like 10 more. The bad thing is like there's so many deadlines to remember. If you're constantly applying to things like every week. 123 00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.360 huda s: Yeah. 124 00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:39.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm glad that you're able to get the games for change submitted. For Apple engineering camp. Did you get a chance to finish your essays or not, yet. 125 00:24:40.068 --> 00:24:42.720 huda s: No, not yet. I was gonna 126 00:24:43.286 --> 00:25:06.880 huda s: oh, yeah. Also I I tried reaching out to the girls, make games like program and seeing if they'd like, accept me as like I think it was like fellowship for the fellowship program. But like I didn't match up the age requirement, so I had to be 18 by the time of the start of camp. But I'll be 17 by then, so. 127 00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.329 Jenny Duan: Hmm! That sucks, and they can't make any acceptance. 128 00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:21.969 huda s: Yeah, I email them asking them if they'd like if they'd be able to make an exception. And they said, unfortunately, we won't be able to like. Take you in as a fellow. But yeah. 129 00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.740 Jenny Duan: Okay 130 00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:32.710 Jenny Duan: sucks, but that I guess that makes sense, like certain things, have legal implications because of age. And so like they that that's kind of out of your control. 131 00:25:33.264 --> 00:25:40.815 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like for the apple thing. You can just submit it whenever you want to. I think this application is not 132 00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:51.259 Jenny Duan: like. I don't think it's too difficult, so I I think, like I don't need to read. I think you can just submit it whenever you're done with that for Cameron Impact. Have you made any progress on the essays yet? 133 00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.090 huda s: Actually, I haven't 134 00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:55.490 Jenny Duan: But cooking. 135 00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:00.179 huda s: I should have put a little bit more time into that. But yeah, I haven't gone through anything. 136 00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.170 Jenny Duan: No worries. Let me check when the deadline is cause I do feel like that's coming up 137 00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.749 Jenny Duan: for the first round. 138 00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.129 Jenny Duan: I do think that it? Okay. 139 00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:18.411 Jenny Duan: Wednesday, may 20. Second. Okay, we still have lots of time. I do think that camera impact is going to be a little bit of a long shot. 140 00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:26.800 Jenny Duan: because just because we don't have as much concrete numbers for your extracurriculars right now. So I would say, like, this is sort of. 141 00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:40.919 Jenny Duan: I would treat it more as an exercise to practice like writing about yourself, because all of these questions asked in this application are probably gonna be essays that come up with your real college applications as well. So that's how I would kind of view and treat 142 00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.250 Jenny Duan: this one. But yeah. 143 00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.552 Jenny Duan: okay, cool now. 144 00:26:50.480 --> 00:27:02.719 Jenny Duan: I guess, since we don't really have any application like since that's all going on in the background. I'm wondering if we could talk a little bit about empowering AI, and how your strategy is going so far with with reaching out to people. 145 00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:08.721 huda s: Yeah. So right now, we have, like, 3 different people applying for 3 different roles. 146 00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.550 Jenny Duan: Couldn't. 147 00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:36.699 huda s: So there's like the publicity who's gonna be in charge of our social media and like making making posts and everything. And then we have secretary who's basically gonna be like the Vice President which I'm planning to kind of like, replace my but current vice president with her. But yeah, she's gonna be like kind of in charge of helping me. Come up with like event ideas, you know, outreach and everything. Then we also have. 148 00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:45.366 huda s: So no one really applied to this one yet but an outreach like directive outreach, so they'll try to get more numbers for us. 149 00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:54.095 huda s: but yeah, I think. And then we also have treasure. So she's gonna be like in charge of, you know. 150 00:27:54.490 --> 00:28:00.519 huda s: kind of. I wanted to establish this as a 501 c. Nonprofit, because like. 151 00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:18.970 huda s: if we can apply to a few things like like. I don't know if you remember, but I I met with some load like a guy who had a nonprofit, and it had like huge numbers. So I was asking for like advice on how he grew his, and then he said he definitely got a lot of like 152 00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:33.719 huda s: he got like a grant through his like nonprofit, because it was like declared, and yeah, and like, he was able to collaborate with like a lot of large nonprofits. I thought that'd be a good idea to like, you know, declare as a 501 C, but 153 00:28:34.478 --> 00:28:43.691 huda s: yeah, that's kind of like the treasures. Job. But yeah, we're trying to like outreach to more people. But in terms of our 154 00:28:44.700 --> 00:29:02.430 huda s: current events, we're trying to get our our competition to get going. So once once I get like these people, these new officers. Like kind of on boarded. We're gonna start with officially. Kind of launch, I guess. But I think I think with a new publicity, maybe we can like make. 155 00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:20.080 huda s: So I recently, I've been seeing like a lot of those like reels and tiktoks and stuff of like people advertising and nonprofits. They've been pretty pretty successful, like, getting more engagement and stuff. So yeah, I've been. I was like hoping like they'd probably be able to do something similar to that. 156 00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:27.811 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think that like that's good. I think social media is one of like the best ways that people 157 00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.420 Jenny Duan: can can grow their org. So I think that sounds really good to me. 158 00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.590 Jenny Duan: curious like 159 00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:41.149 Jenny Duan: how the outreach in terms of the curriculum toolkit is going with with the game. 160 00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:48.890 huda s: Yeah. So I've been like searching for more emails to send. So I found, like, like. 161 00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.256 huda s: I guess. 162 00:29:50.830 --> 00:30:04.768 huda s: 3 more like valid emails that to send to but none of them are applying. I feel like it might be because, my emails are like a like a school email. So might be getting like detected as spam or something. 163 00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.970 huda s: so 164 00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:17.539 huda s: maybe that's like an issue. But I think if I reach out to more people, sometimes like teachers, have, like Linkedin. So maybe I can try reaching out to them there. But. 165 00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:23.751 Jenny Duan: Oh, I wouldn't do that on Linkedin. I feel like they might re view that as like a breach of their personal privacy or something. 166 00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.397 Jenny Duan: so I may not do that. 167 00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.010 Jenny Duan: but 168 00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.530 Jenny Duan: I would say. 169 00:30:32.034 --> 00:30:34.410 Jenny Duan: Let's see, is there some way you can like? 170 00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.830 Jenny Duan: How else can you pitch this if do you have like a district email that you can use to send emails through? Is that what you're doing. 171 00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.900 huda s: I've been sending it through my personal email, but I I couldn't send it from my school email. 172 00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.330 Jenny Duan: Okay, why don't we do this school email? Because I feel like that will help 173 00:30:56.906 --> 00:30:58.649 Jenny Duan: with the with us 174 00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.290 Jenny Duan: that will help with the like. 175 00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.370 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh! I'm losing the word! 176 00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.469 Jenny Duan: The foot, the filter. 177 00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.016 huda s: And then. 178 00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.320 Jenny Duan: cool. So 179 00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:17.389 Jenny Duan: okay, let's do that. And then why don't you just reach out to all the save emails that you did before? But use the use this full email this time. 180 00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.690 huda s: Also, 181 00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:29.639 huda s: can we like maybe draft an email for like 182 00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:35.212 huda s: reaching out. Cause I think last time it wasn't as effective, maybe use like the way. 183 00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.889 Jenny Duan: Can I see it? 184 00:31:39.055 --> 00:31:39.960 huda s: Yeah. 185 00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.760 Jenny Duan: Thanks. 186 00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.680 Jenny Duan: Okay. 187 00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.800 Jenny Duan: maybe. Say, I hope this finds. I hope this email finds you well. 188 00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.320 huda s: I put in. 189 00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.060 Jenny Duan: Can you just copy paste that email into this, Doc? And then we can work directly off of this talk. 190 00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:16.150 huda s: Yeah. 191 00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.920 Jenny Duan: Meeting. 192 00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.840 Jenny Duan: What do you call it? Tracy, California or Mountain California? 193 00:32:39.955 --> 00:32:41.609 huda s: You could say either. I think 194 00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.429 huda s: Tracy, California is more known. 195 00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.330 Jenny Duan: When is your birthday huddle. 196 00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.170 huda s: July third. 197 00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:15.339 Jenny Duan: Okay. So now we know, like, when we can stop saying 16 year old when we have to say 17 year old game developer. 198 00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:15.940 huda s: Yeah. 199 00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.799 Jenny Duan: How long we've been working on Santoria 200 00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.650 Jenny Duan: a year or a year and a half or 2 years. 201 00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.689 huda s: Let's say, a year and a half. Yeah, around 2 years. 202 00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:43.679 Jenny Duan: Let's find, like the standards that this curriculum fits in California like you know how there are national standards for education. 203 00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.080 Jenny Duan: Can you see if this game aligns with any of them? 204 00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.339 huda s: However, we could have. 205 00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.649 Jenny Duan: Maybe, like California, like education 206 00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.840 Jenny Duan: standards, or like education, curriculum standards. 207 00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.389 huda s: Oh, she's in middle school. 208 00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.440 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, middle or elementary. I forget. 209 00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:16.410 Jenny Duan: Middle. Okay. 210 00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.040 huda s: gone through this week. 211 00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:56.640 Jenny Duan: But 212 00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.860 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, let's look at the content standards. 213 00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:07.379 Jenny Duan: And then let's see, like the common core 214 00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:12.999 Jenny Duan: or not. English language arts, would it be cte. Let's see for Cs. Maybe. 215 00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.480 huda s: Engineering. 216 00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.760 Jenny Duan: Engineering architecture. Yeah, I'm not. 217 00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.450 huda s: Maybe this information and communication technology. 218 00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.640 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, that would probably be the best. Yeah. 219 00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.610 Jenny Duan: does it have like numbers, like, like, for example, Ct, ICT, like, 2334. 220 00:37:50.996 --> 00:37:51.770 huda s: There's this. 221 00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.520 Jenny Duan: Okay, perfect. 222 00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.860 Jenny Duan: yeah. So point to. 223 00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:04.680 huda s: Yeah. 224 00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:07.820 huda s: open. To. 225 00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.652 Jenny Duan: E to E. 4.2. 226 00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.790 Jenny Duan: How do we cite this. 227 00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.760 huda s: Alone. 228 00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.590 huda s: I guess it's a link. 229 00:39:19.558 --> 00:39:21.860 huda s: I guess 10.1 as well. 230 00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:26.259 Jenny Duan: Okay, 10.1 or 7.1. Would you say. 231 00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.439 huda s: 10.1 232 00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.690 huda s: that 233 00:40:20.814 --> 00:40:23.329 huda s: yeah, do we need to have more or. 234 00:40:24.958 --> 00:40:27.150 Jenny Duan: Hmm! I don't think so. 235 00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:29.150 huda s: Okay. 236 00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:35.210 huda s: Oh. 237 00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.900 Jenny Duan: I wouldn't think. 238 00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.550 huda s: Like, is. 239 00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.650 Jenny Duan: Oh, go ahead! 240 00:40:38.946 --> 00:40:42.510 huda s: I think I made a like a Google form for people to 241 00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:44.770 huda s: get feedback. 242 00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.940 Jenny Duan: Oh, do you have a link to the form. 243 00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.210 huda s: This one. 244 00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.394 huda s: Wait! Let me send like one of those links 245 00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.059 Jenny Duan: That's okay. I'm I'm just gonna link this into one of the texts 246 00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:02.420 Jenny Duan: like, whenever you send links. I think nowadays it's not as common to put it in parentheses, I think it's more common to just link it. 247 00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.440 huda s: Yeah. 248 00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:28.429 Jenny Duan: okay, I think this is good. The other thing that I think you can. Okay, actually read over this before I move on to the next thing. 249 00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.019 Jenny Duan: feel free to make any edits. 250 00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.439 huda s: okay, this is great. I love. 251 00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.660 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing 252 00:41:52.997 --> 00:41:55.540 Jenny Duan: and then all the like things are hyperlinked. 253 00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:01.224 Jenny Duan: The underlying things I've never seen like a completely black Google docs before. 254 00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.870 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's an extension 255 00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.379 Jenny Duan: I was like, I don't even know if we have dark mode or something. This is cool. 256 00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.795 huda s: Yeah. 257 00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.490 Jenny Duan: Okay. 258 00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.590 Jenny Duan: how is this different from normal night mode or dark mode? 259 00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:23.309 huda s: I think I mean like before, when I was trying to show open docs. It would never be in dark mode. I think that's good. 260 00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:23.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah, session. 261 00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.546 huda s: After that. 262 00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.400 Jenny Duan: How's Darkwood? 263 00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.489 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense. Actually. 264 00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:39.699 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. So the other thing that I wanted to mention is you could go and pitch to school board meetings. If you figure out when those are. 265 00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:41.999 huda s: Yeah, I can. 266 00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:54.250 huda s: So I think I showed you the certification like like that form. But I think I could probably also like pitch. That during one of those meetings, as well. 267 00:42:54.430 --> 00:43:03.610 Jenny Duan: Like, yeah, like, I think those meetings should be public to like should be public. So like nothing stopping you from literally just like driving there, showing up and like 268 00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:17.272 Jenny Duan: contributing respectfully. I think that's also like makes a really good story like if you went and like went to a school board, and you pitch your idea like that shows a lot about your personal character in a positive way. And like, that's something you can definitely write about in future essays. 269 00:43:17.851 --> 00:43:23.869 Jenny Duan: So I feel like you should try to do that. You can do it at several different districts like you don't have to do it in your district, too. You can do it in like 270 00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:30.159 Jenny Duan: many different districts, but start with one first, and then maybe move on from there also. Another thing. 271 00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.339 Jenny Duan: These these like 272 00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.080 Jenny Duan: notes are like a little bit fungible. For example, if you email it to 273 00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:41.349 Jenny Duan: like a hundred people, you can say that you distributed your toolkit to like a hundred people 274 00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:49.719 Jenny Duan: doesn't matter how much how many people use it. But like, if you send it to them, you could say you distributed it to them like, that's that's true. 275 00:43:50.161 --> 00:44:10.160 Jenny Duan: That's not like that's not false like. So if you, the more people you send it to, we can also use that as a metric, because you can say, like, you distributed your toolkit to like 100 different teachers from across the nation like, if you emailed it to them like that counts. I feel like as distribution. I don't know if that's misleading. Do you feel like that's misleading. 276 00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:19.909 huda s: No, I think it's it's cause it could also be the case that, like someone used it. But they just didn't like let us know. So I mean, it's not really. 277 00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:33.239 Jenny Duan: I think you should aim for at least 5 schools that actually use it, because then you'll be able to talk about them and like the impacts in the classroom, and like, you'll be able to like, write about that or talk about that. An essay. But like beyond those 5 examples, like 278 00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:44.000 Jenny Duan: the rest of the metrics, are kind of just for vanity like you can distribute it if you like. That's why I'm saying that you shouldn't mass email it out and make a tracker of the people who email it out to you because 279 00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:48.699 Jenny Duan: after emailing it to like a thousand people, I think you can say that you've distributed it to them 280 00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.889 Jenny Duan: and like 281 00:44:50.336 --> 00:44:57.509 Jenny Duan: that's like a pretty metric, even if you've just distributed it like it doesn't matter if they've used it, that in and of itself is pretty powerful metric. 282 00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:06.550 huda s: Yeah, I've just been like, I've been kind of having trouble, like finding emails to, you know, distribute them to cause like, I try to go like 283 00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:09.970 huda s: I'll try to name, like all the districts that I know, for, like the neighborhood. 284 00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:21.049 huda s: And then I just go to like their staff directory. And then, like, I find, like the person in charge of like computer science, and whatnot. And then I just like email them. But if that's. 285 00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.160 Jenny Duan: Like that's really. 286 00:45:22.645 --> 00:45:23.130 huda s: Speaker! 287 00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.220 Jenny Duan: The math teachers, too. 288 00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:33.010 huda s: Oh, maybe like statistics, teachers maybe even cause it's like data, science kind of. 289 00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:37.832 Jenny Duan: Even like if you make it more ethics. See? You could also do like language arts, teachers, too. 290 00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.000 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's fine. 291 00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:40.900 huda s: And who? 292 00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.070 huda s: Oh, yeah, that would be, yeah. 293 00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:54.759 huda s: I can. So I can like, just keep doing that. But I just, I still feel like. It's like a really slow process. So it might be like hard for me to find, like 1,000 people. 294 00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:10.589 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, a thousand is just an arbitrary number like it could be 50, it could be a hundred. It could. Whatever is is reasonable to you. But, like the point is, just keep doing this, and the more people you reach out to the better, because it's just a vanity, metric, that's all it is. 295 00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.340 huda s: Condominium. 296 00:46:13.262 --> 00:46:18.389 Jenny Duan: But I think, like the key is trying to find those 5 schools that will actually use it and like, give you feedback. 297 00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:24.849 Jenny Duan: So if you need to go to a school board to like, ask them to do it. Maybe that's the solution. Yeah. 298 00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:34.329 Jenny Duan: okay, how some dmming people have you also been damming people about this game? Not sure if you've done that, or how that's going. 299 00:46:35.221 --> 00:46:43.339 huda s: Oh, yeah, so on linkedin I connected with so there's a girl. I think she's 300 00:46:43.540 --> 00:47:07.769 huda s: my age. But she has like this, like podcast where she talks about like women in tech and everything side. So she was gonna ask me about the and see what awards. So she connected with me. First, we're gonna answer your questions kind of vaguely. And then I was like, Oh, can you please tell me more about your podcast I'd love to learn more. And then so I kinda introduced myself. And I said, Oh, I'd love to get involved with your 301 00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:15.810 huda s: podcast or be featured. Let me know if there's anything I can do. So possible feature there. 302 00:47:16.165 --> 00:47:27.170 huda s: But yeah, other than that, I think I've been connecting with, like a few more professionals. In game development, like, whoever like connects to me, I try to like reply. 303 00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:39.321 huda s: And just yeah, get to know them. But yeah, also, I got linkedin premium like the like the trial version. So maybe I could use like the I think 304 00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:46.339 huda s: in mails. I think they're called maybe I can use that to like publicize, empower AI. Maybe. 305 00:47:48.934 --> 00:47:53.680 Jenny Duan: You should also reach out to this person, Natasha. Dante. 306 00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:56.860 Jenny Duan: I feel like she would be pretty powerful 307 00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.520 Jenny Duan: to reach out to. 308 00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.050 Jenny Duan: And 309 00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:07.529 Jenny Duan: yeah, what do you think? 310 00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.970 huda s: Slowly. 311 00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.450 huda s: oh, wow! 312 00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:21.640 Jenny Duan: That's completely. 313 00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.400 Jenny Duan: She's also included with the alum. 314 00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.850 Jenny Duan: So and she also has a podcast 315 00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.879 Jenny Duan: so I feel like, she'll be a good person to speak to. 316 00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:32.597 huda s: That's really interesting. And then and she's 317 00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.449 huda s: she's been on the news, and she got the Nc. With award. 318 00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:37.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 319 00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:44.539 Jenny Duan: So I feel like she should be someone who's like a little bit inspiring for you, and also someone that can like 320 00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:49.259 Jenny Duan: speak with and and learn from. So you should connect and say, your codes. Clausia love 321 00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:50.350 Jenny Duan: found. 322 00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.730 Jenny Duan: If you talk to her you can say that you know me. I think she knows me, too, like 323 00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.940 Jenny Duan: we're we're like mutuals 324 00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.180 Jenny Duan: foamed. 325 00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.370 Jenny Duan: But yeah. 326 00:49:00.765 --> 00:49:05.100 Jenny Duan: okay, that's kind of all I want to go over today. Next time I wanna just finish 327 00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:17.979 Jenny Duan: like, continue looking at your camera impact scholarship application. And I also want to talk about the breakthrough challenge idea, because I think that will take you some time to like film and edit. So yeah, any other questions before you wrap for today. 328 00:49:18.538 --> 00:49:20.330 huda s: No, that's about all for today. 329 00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.749 Jenny Duan: Okay, then, sounds good. Talk to you. Soon feel free to text me if you have any questions. 330 00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.899 Jenny Duan: Bye, bye.",

Sorry for joining late. I I just got home from school, so I forgot about the call. 4 00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.550 Jenny Duan: Hi! No worries! How's it going. 5 00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.252 huda s: It's going well, how are you? 6 00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:33.995 Jenny Duan: Doing well, too good to see you. Let's just get started. I think we're already running a little behind. So let's just get started. 7 00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:40.020 Jenny Duan: first of all, did you get any of the text that I sent you about? Sending the update to your teacher for J. Camp? 8 00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.890 huda s: oh, yeah, I just I just saw that. Yeah. 9 00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:54.370 Jenny Duan: Okay, did. Do you wanna draft like a quick email? Or do you wanna tell them in person? Maybe cause I feel like. 10 00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.230 Jenny Duan: now it's definitely good to give them an update about your progress. 11 00:11:59.215 --> 00:12:04.740 huda s: Maybe in person. I don't think they I don't think he responds to emails that much. 12 00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:13.159 Jenny Duan: Oh, right, it's this teacher. Oh, my goodness, okay. Well, be sure to tell him in person. I'm sure he'll be really happy to hear the news? 13 00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.999 Jenny Duan: okay. Awesome. 14 00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:32.690 Jenny Duan: next. The other thing is, did you see this breakthrough Junior challenge that I sent you? We could also take a look at that right now. I don't have. We talked about this in the past. There's a chance that I've already brought it up, but I'm not sure if I have. 15 00:12:33.088 --> 00:12:35.079 huda s: I don't think we have. 16 00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:43.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's take a look at this. So this is on a chall",
    "enge called Breakthrough. It's run by an academy. 17 00:12:43.715 --> 00:12:49.184 Jenny Duan: And if you win this. It's like a big scholarship. But it's 18 00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.670 Jenny Duan: I think it's a 2 min video about 19 00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:57.760 Jenny Duan: anything like science? A science topic. 20 00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:09.490 Jenny Duan: yeah, yours. You're submitting an original video 2 min that brings to life a concept or theory in the life sciences, physics, or mathematics. So it's about science communication. 21 00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:19.250 Jenny Duan: and if you win, you get like $100,000. Your school gets money like you get money for a lab like, it's it's a very big project. 22 00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.250 Jenny Duan: And 23 00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.260 Jenny Duan: yeah. 24 00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:34.939 Jenny Duan: so I think that you could, you could definitely be eligible for this and I think that you could make like a really good video, since you already do a lot of like science communication type of work. 25 00:13:36.084 --> 00:13:42.119 huda s: For science communication like, what does that specifically mean? Like, so 26 00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.416 huda s: this, could it be including like computer science? Or is it just kind of. 27 00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.269 Jenny Duan: No, I think life, sciences, physics, or mathematics. 28 00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.670 Jenny Duan: Let's look at some of the previous winners 29 00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.519 Jenny Duan: my friends was. She's from Mauritius, like the country. 30 00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.189 Jenny Duan: But let me show you hers. 31 00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.570 Jenny Duan: look. Okay, let me show you. Let me share my screen. Can see this as well. 32 00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.120 Jenny Duan: Golf. 33 00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:35.190 Jenny Duan: Can you see this. 34 00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.509 Jenny Duan: Okay, so it's positively charged. And this one has a negative charge close t",
    "ogether. 35 00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:49.559 huda s: They attract. That's no surprise. But what if they weren't charged on neutral objects? Could they still attract each other? 36 00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.050 huda s: Do 37 00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.420 huda s: they actually can. But if you're thinking 38 00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.669 huda s: that's impossible, let's change perspectives and take a look closer 39 00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:17.810 huda s: me through the atomic and molecular worlds where negative electrons and positive nucleus rate, their charges cancel to 0 when they form atoms, atoms from molecules, and these particles build pretty much everything around us. But even with 0 charge, these particles can attract. 40 00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:32.099 huda s: How well, think about this molecule as a school. When the electron students play catch outside, they constantly, randomly move around the nucleus campus, keeping overall charge 0 with their random movement, can result in more electrons found on one side than the other. 41 00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:53.910 huda s: This electron heavy area takes a temporary, small or partial negative charge, and the other a positive one. Surrounding molecules can induce. Into this trend, and since opposite charges attract the molecules, get pulled together. We call these fender vowels, forces correctly aligned for closed neutral surfaces together. That's how Geckos climbed the walls, and how engineers created these amazing Geffel clows 42 00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:13.610 huda s: whoa so thunder vowels forces allow neutral objects to attract. But guess what? There's another way this can happen, explained by the Casmia effect in the quantum world, and the quantum world is pretty weird. This particle also behaves like a wave, and waves have different wavelengths. Now watch what happens when I place these 2 boats in this area full of waves. 43 00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:39.329 huda s: You can see that waves of all wavelengths hit their bose fro",
    "m outside, but only some fit between more waves means greater forces exerted on their Bose from outside than between. So the boats get pushed together. Now let's apply this knowledge to the Casmir effect. If we create what we would think as empty space, a vacuum removing all matter and reducing energy to minimum. There are still virtual particles and antiparticles that pop PIN in pairs and annulate out of existence. 44 00:16:39.330 --> 00:17:04.299 huda s: When we place these 2 neutral metal plates parallel and close together, the plates act as mirrors for virtual photons, virtual particles of light, virtual photons of all wavelength sparks off the plates from outside, where only those whose wavelengths fit a whole number of times into the gap bounce between, like we saw in the boats. More virtual photons means. A greater force is exerted on the plates from outside and between. So the plates get pushed together. That's how Lecasmia force allows 45 00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.690 huda s: surfaces to attract 46 00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:33.319 huda s: the worst to use. Will ever wanted your computer lighter and faster. Yeah, smaller and more powerful. Nano Chips could be the answer. But at such small scale the Casimir force attracts the components inside, making these innovations more difficult. So you see whether we notice it or not, we're surrounded by strange phenomena capable of explaining seemingly absurd ideas. So whatever the situation, if something seems impossible, change perspectives, take a step closer or further and 47 00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.190 huda s: find a way to make that impossible possible. 48 00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.726 huda s: That's cool. 49 00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:40.980 Jenny Duan: Think. 50 00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:47.611 huda s: I think it's really I think it's kind of complicated like to be honest. I don't 51 00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:54.760 huda s: know much about like sciences. So maybe I won't be able to do something as complex as that. But 52 ",
    "00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.929 huda s: yeah, I was pretty. 53 00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.200 Jenny Duan: You can also do it about science. You can also do it about 54 00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:12.330 Jenny Duan: life, about mathematics, life, sciences, fundamental physics. And also yours is gonna be only 2 min. Hers is 3 min, but the limit this year is only 2 min. 55 00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.599 Jenny Duan: So, but I feel like you'll have enough time to like, learn about, concept and explain it. 56 00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.440 huda s: Yeah. 57 00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:28.610 Jenny Duan: In detail. I think the primary thing is just not the concept itself, but like how well you explain it, and also the level of editing that you use cause like I think her editing was really good. 58 00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.390 huda s: Yeah. 59 00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:34.450 Jenny Duan: Like that probably contributed to her win. But I feel like you're good at editing, too, so that shouldn't be a problem. 60 00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:43.284 huda s: Yeah, hopefully, so maybe I could probably do something. Maybe more based around math. 61 00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.220 huda s: And 62 00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.370 huda s: I can explain. 63 00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.300 huda s: maybe like 64 00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.399 huda s: something like derivatives, or something like that. 65 00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:04.263 Jenny Duan: I think that they're probably looking for something more complicated. So when they say, math, you're probably gonna have to do something like pretty theoretical, or something like a lot different. 66 00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:15.479 Jenny Duan: cause. I think that like there, you're being judged for how well you can explain a difficult concept in an easy to understand way, but, like the concept itself, still has to be like relatively difficult. 67 00:19:16.074 --> 00:19:20.089 huda s: Okay, I, I can do some brainstorming on that, maybe, then. 68 00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.264 Jenny D",
    "uan: Oh, yeah. And also that it doesn't start until 69 00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.440 Jenny Duan: Let's see, when the 70 00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.600 Jenny Duan: okay applications open. April and the submission deadline is June 20 fifth. 71 00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:48.080 Jenny Duan: So that's like some context for the timeline. So just opened, you have about 2 months until June 20 fifth to brainstorm and think about what you want to write about. So I'm gonna make a note of that. And like, next time we meet, we could talk about some potential ideas. And I think 72 00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:57.390 Jenny Duan: the more complicated the topic is, the better, because and then the better job at explaining you do of the difficult topic the better. So 73 00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:11.940 Jenny Duan: you don't have to choose like the hardest topic in the world as long as something you feel confident, explaining cause. That's ultimately the the goal. But I do feel like if you do something that relatively, people have a hard time understanding, which is, gonna be hard things. It's gonna pay off. 74 00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.600 Jenny Duan: Pat. 75 00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.899 Jenny Duan: Okay, let me make a note of that 76 00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.490 Jenny Duan: and 77 00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.060 Jenny Duan: due. It's due. June 24, June 2024. 78 00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.559 Jenny Duan: So let's make sure. June 20, fifth, 2024 is when it's due. 79 00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.816 Jenny Duan: And then that is another another thing that reminds me of this scholarship that 80 00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.759 Jenny Duan: we're not. We haven't even begun the timeline for. But I do just want to send this to you. 81 00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.850 Jenny Duan: 1 s. 82 00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.489 Jenny Duan: okay. And then, if you want to take a look at this link I'm putting in the chat. 83 00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:06.410 Jenny Duan: This is another scholarship that I feel like you should apply fo",
    "r. 84 00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.074 Jenny Duan: This one is 85 00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.799 Jenny Duan: going to be a 3 min video 86 00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:17.529 Jenny Duan: about a stem topic that you're passionate about. 87 00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:26.430 Jenny Duan: I think this can be any stem topic. So this one includes computer science and one of the previous winners was a computer science 88 00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.650 Jenny Duan: person. 89 00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.510 Jenny Duan: yeah. 90 00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.430 Jenny Duan: So I think this is another good opportunity. And if you win this, this is a full scholarship to college. 91 00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.830 huda s: So. 92 00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, 4 years like fully paid for if you win. 93 00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.920 Jenny Duan: So. 94 00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:50.799 huda s: Oh, that's really cool. I think this one like maybe it could be nice to talk about like AI ethics. Maybe. 95 00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah. But I feel like it. Should, you should focus on the stem part. So maybe, like. 96 00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:06.370 Jenny Duan: how like machine learning algorithms, how like the different machine learning algorithms work. And like, I think ethics shouldn't be a part of it. But I feel like they want you to. If I think it's the same thing as the breakthrough thing where they want you to. 97 00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.869 Jenny Duan: they want you to explain a very crazy topic in in in an interesting way. 98 00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.495 Jenny Duan: So 99 00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:23.759 Jenny Duan: for example, in this one, you can look at the previous winners and like, look at their videos. But they're all pretty technical. 100 00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.050 Jenny Duan: This well. 101 00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.980 huda s: Okay. 102 00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.185 Jenny Duan: But as we transition to 103 00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.610 Jenny Duan: the summer, we're",
    " gonna start like 104 00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:53.299 Jenny Duan: camera impact is just the start. But like we're gonna go into awards mode. So like we recently just been in like summer application mode. But we're gonna start going into like awards and scholarships mode, because that's gonna be taking up 105 00:22:53.300 --> 00:23:15.749 Jenny Duan: like I fully anticipate you would apply for like 20 or 30 scholarships, and I wanna get as much of your college paid for as possible. So I think you have a good chance of winning a lot of scholarships, and I don't wanna miss out on any of them. So this is just a preview. I have like lots more in the pocket. So better get used to writing. Why, why do I want this scholarship? Why, I think I'm gonna be a good fit, because that's gonna be your life for the next like 106 00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.010 Jenny Duan: 10 months. 107 00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.300 Jenny Duan: also college implications, but likes. 108 00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.250 huda s: Reference, too. 109 00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:31.490 Jenny Duan: okay, so make a note. Okay. So back to the original topic, make a note to talk to your journalism, teacher about the letter of Reg 110 00:23:32.251 --> 00:23:35.208 Jenny Duan: or about receiving the program 111 00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.150 Jenny Duan: and then you haven't run any updates from any other programs. Have you. 112 00:23:41.457 --> 00:23:42.379 huda s: No, I haven't. 113 00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.222 Jenny Duan: Okay, no worries. 114 00:23:44.955 --> 00:23:49.080 Jenny Duan: Apple engineering camp. Were you able to submit your application there. 115 00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.719 huda s: Oh, I haven't actually 116 00:23:52.457 --> 00:23:58.682 huda s: oh, yeah, I did have an update about games for change. I was able to submit that one. 117 00:23:59.010 --> 00:23:59.580 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing. 118 00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.399 huda s: And the weekend, and. 119 00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.289 Jenny Duan: Okay, ama",
    "zing thanks. So much. 120 00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:12.160 Jenny Duan: Also, thanks for staying on top of the deadlines. I'm sorry about the Regan Leadership Award deadline. I think I'll try to be more visual of the deadlines, too, in the future. 121 00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.610 huda s: No, that's okay. I think I should have checked as well. 122 00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:29.268 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like it's okay. The good thing about apply the good and bad thing about applying to a ton of things is. Well, the good thing is, if you miss one, there's always like 10 more. The bad thing is like there's so many deadlines to remember. If you're constantly applying to things like every week. 123 00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.360 huda s: Yeah. 124 00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:39.309 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm glad that you're able to get the games for change submitted. For Apple engineering camp. Did you get a chance to finish your essays or not, yet. 125 00:24:40.068 --> 00:24:42.720 huda s: No, not yet. I was gonna 126 00:24:43.286 --> 00:25:06.880 huda s: oh, yeah. Also I I tried reaching out to the girls, make games like program and seeing if they'd like, accept me as like I think it was like fellowship for the fellowship program. But like I didn't match up the age requirement, so I had to be 18 by the time of the start of camp. But I'll be 17 by then, so. 127 00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.329 Jenny Duan: Hmm! That sucks, and they can't make any acceptance. 128 00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:21.969 huda s: Yeah, I email them asking them if they'd like if they'd be able to make an exception. And they said, unfortunately, we won't be able to like. Take you in as a fellow. But yeah. 129 00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.740 Jenny Duan: Okay 130 00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:32.710 Jenny Duan: sucks, but that I guess that makes sense, like certain things, have legal implications because of age. And so like they that that's kind of out of your control. 131 00:25:33.264 --> 00:25:40.815 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like ",
    "for the apple thing. You can just submit it whenever you want to. I think this application is not 132 00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:51.259 Jenny Duan: like. I don't think it's too difficult, so I I think, like I don't need to read. I think you can just submit it whenever you're done with that for Cameron Impact. Have you made any progress on the essays yet? 133 00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.090 huda s: Actually, I haven't 134 00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:55.490 Jenny Duan: But cooking. 135 00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:00.179 huda s: I should have put a little bit more time into that. But yeah, I haven't gone through anything. 136 00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.170 Jenny Duan: No worries. Let me check when the deadline is cause I do feel like that's coming up 137 00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.749 Jenny Duan: for the first round. 138 00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.129 Jenny Duan: I do think that it? Okay. 139 00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:18.411 Jenny Duan: Wednesday, may 20. Second. Okay, we still have lots of time. I do think that camera impact is going to be a little bit of a long shot. 140 00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:26.800 Jenny Duan: because just because we don't have as much concrete numbers for your extracurriculars right now. So I would say, like, this is sort of. 141 00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:40.919 Jenny Duan: I would treat it more as an exercise to practice like writing about yourself, because all of these questions asked in this application are probably gonna be essays that come up with your real college applications as well. So that's how I would kind of view and treat 142 00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.250 Jenny Duan: this one. But yeah. 143 00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.552 Jenny Duan: okay, cool now. 144 00:26:50.480 --> 00:27:02.719 Jenny Duan: I guess, since we don't really have any application like since that's all going on in the background. I'm wondering if we could talk a little bit about empowering AI, and how your strategy is going so far with with reaching out to people. 145 00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:08.7",
    "21 huda s: Yeah. So right now, we have, like, 3 different people applying for 3 different roles. 146 00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.550 Jenny Duan: Couldn't. 147 00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:36.699 huda s: So there's like the publicity who's gonna be in charge of our social media and like making making posts and everything. And then we have secretary who's basically gonna be like the Vice President which I'm planning to kind of like, replace my but current vice president with her. But yeah, she's gonna be like kind of in charge of helping me. Come up with like event ideas, you know, outreach and everything. Then we also have. 148 00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:45.366 huda s: So no one really applied to this one yet but an outreach like directive outreach, so they'll try to get more numbers for us. 149 00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:54.095 huda s: but yeah, I think. And then we also have treasure. So she's gonna be like in charge of, you know. 150 00:27:54.490 --> 00:28:00.519 huda s: kind of. I wanted to establish this as a 501 c. Nonprofit, because like. 151 00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:18.970 huda s: if we can apply to a few things like like. I don't know if you remember, but I I met with some load like a guy who had a nonprofit, and it had like huge numbers. So I was asking for like advice on how he grew his, and then he said he definitely got a lot of like 152 00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:33.719 huda s: he got like a grant through his like nonprofit, because it was like declared, and yeah, and like, he was able to collaborate with like a lot of large nonprofits. I thought that'd be a good idea to like, you know, declare as a 501 C, but 153 00:28:34.478 --> 00:28:43.691 huda s: yeah, that's kind of like the treasures. Job. But yeah, we're trying to like outreach to more people. But in terms of our 154 00:28:44.700 --> 00:29:02.430 huda s: current events, we're trying to get our our competition to get going. So once once I get like these people, these new officers. Like kind of on boarded. We're gonna ",
    "start with officially. Kind of launch, I guess. But I think I think with a new publicity, maybe we can like make. 155 00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:20.080 huda s: So I recently, I've been seeing like a lot of those like reels and tiktoks and stuff of like people advertising and nonprofits. They've been pretty pretty successful, like, getting more engagement and stuff. So yeah, I've been. I was like hoping like they'd probably be able to do something similar to that. 156 00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:27.811 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think that like that's good. I think social media is one of like the best ways that people 157 00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.420 Jenny Duan: can can grow their org. So I think that sounds really good to me. 158 00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.590 Jenny Duan: curious like 159 00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:41.149 Jenny Duan: how the outreach in terms of the curriculum toolkit is going with with the game. 160 00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:48.890 huda s: Yeah. So I've been like searching for more emails to send. So I found, like, like. 161 00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.256 huda s: I guess. 162 00:29:50.830 --> 00:30:04.768 huda s: 3 more like valid emails that to send to but none of them are applying. I feel like it might be because, my emails are like a like a school email. So might be getting like detected as spam or something. 163 00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.970 huda s: so 164 00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:17.539 huda s: maybe that's like an issue. But I think if I reach out to more people, sometimes like teachers, have, like Linkedin. So maybe I can try reaching out to them there. But. 165 00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:23.751 Jenny Duan: Oh, I wouldn't do that on Linkedin. I feel like they might re view that as like a breach of their personal privacy or something. 166 00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.397 Jenny Duan: so I may not do that. 167 00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.010 Jenny Duan: but 168 00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.530 Jenny Duan: I would say. 169 00:30:32.034 --> 00:30:34.410",
    " Jenny Duan: Let's see, is there some way you can like? 170 00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.830 Jenny Duan: How else can you pitch this if do you have like a district email that you can use to send emails through? Is that what you're doing. 171 00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.900 huda s: I've been sending it through my personal email, but I I couldn't send it from my school email. 172 00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.330 Jenny Duan: Okay, why don't we do this school email? Because I feel like that will help 173 00:30:56.906 --> 00:30:58.649 Jenny Duan: with the with us 174 00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.290 Jenny Duan: that will help with the like. 175 00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.370 Jenny Duan: Oh, my gosh! I'm losing the word! 176 00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.469 Jenny Duan: The foot, the filter. 177 00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.016 huda s: And then. 178 00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.320 Jenny Duan: cool. So 179 00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:17.389 Jenny Duan: okay, let's do that. And then why don't you just reach out to all the save emails that you did before? But use the use this full email this time. 180 00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.690 huda s: Also, 181 00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:29.639 huda s: can we like maybe draft an email for like 182 00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:35.212 huda s: reaching out. Cause I think last time it wasn't as effective, maybe use like the way. 183 00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.889 Jenny Duan: Can I see it? 184 00:31:39.055 --> 00:31:39.960 huda s: Yeah. 185 00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.760 Jenny Duan: Thanks. 186 00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.680 Jenny Duan: Okay. 187 00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.800 Jenny Duan: maybe.

Okay, actually read over this before I move on to the next thing. 249 00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.019 Jenny Duan: feel free to make any edits. 250 00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.439 huda s: okay, this is great. I love. 251 00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.660 Jenny Duan: Okay, amazing 252 00:41:52.997 --> 00:41:55.540 Jenny Duan: and then all the like things are hyperlinked. 253 00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:01.224 Jenny Duan: The underlying things I've never seen like a completely black Google docs before. 254 00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.870 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's an extension 255 00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.379 Jenny Duan: I was like, I don't even know if we have dark mode or something. This is cool. 256 00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.795 huda s: Yeah. 257 00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.490 Jenny Duan: Okay. 258 00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.590 Jenny Duan: how is this different from normal night mode or dark mode? 259 00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:23.309 huda s: I think I mean like before, when I was trying to show open docs. It would never be in dark mode. I think that's good. 260 00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:23.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah, session. 261 00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.546 huda s: After that. 262 00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.400 Jenny Duan: How's Darkwood? 263 00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.489 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes sense. Actually. 264 00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:39.699 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. So the other thing that I wanted to mention is you could go and pitch to school board meetings. If you figure out when those are. 265 00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:41.999 huda s: Yeah, I can. 266 00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:",
    "54.250 huda s: So I think I showed you the certification like like that form. But I think I could probably also like pitch. That during one of those meetings, as well. 267 00:42:54.430 --> 00:43:03.610 Jenny Duan: Like, yeah, like, I think those meetings should be public to like should be public. So like nothing stopping you from literally just like driving there, showing up and like 268 00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:17.272 Jenny Duan: contributing respectfully. I think that's also like makes a really good story like if you went and like went to a school board, and you pitch your idea like that shows a lot about your personal character in a positive way. And like, that's something you can definitely write about in future essays. 269 00:43:17.851 --> 00:43:23.869 Jenny Duan: So I feel like you should try to do that. You can do it at several different districts like you don't have to do it in your district, too. You can do it in like 270 00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:30.159 Jenny Duan: many different districts, but start with one first, and then maybe move on from there also. Another thing. 271 00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.339 Jenny Duan: These these like 272 00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.080 Jenny Duan: notes are like a little bit fungible. For example, if you email it to 273 00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:41.349 Jenny Duan: like a hundred people, you can say that you distributed your toolkit to like a hundred people 274 00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:49.719 Jenny Duan: doesn't matter how much how many people use it. But like, if you send it to them, you could say you distributed it to them like, that's that's true. 275 00:43:50.161 --> 00:44:10.160 Jenny Duan: That's not like that's not false like. So if you, the more people you send it to, we can also use that as a metric, because you can say, like, you distributed your toolkit to like 100 different teachers from across the nation like, if you emailed it to them like that counts. I feel like as distribution. I don't know if that's misleading. Do you f",
    "eel like that's misleading. 276 00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:19.909 huda s: No, I think it's it's cause it could also be the case that, like someone used it. But they just didn't like let us know. So I mean, it's not really. 277 00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:33.239 Jenny Duan: I think you should aim for at least 5 schools that actually use it, because then you'll be able to talk about them and like the impacts in the classroom, and like, you'll be able to like, write about that or talk about that. An essay. But like beyond those 5 examples, like 278 00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:44.000 Jenny Duan: the rest of the metrics, are kind of just for vanity like you can distribute it if you like. That's why I'm saying that you shouldn't mass email it out and make a tracker of the people who email it out to you because 279 00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:48.699 Jenny Duan: after emailing it to like a thousand people, I think you can say that you've distributed it to them 280 00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.889 Jenny Duan: and like 281 00:44:50.336 --> 00:44:57.509 Jenny Duan: that's like a pretty metric, even if you've just distributed it like it doesn't matter if they've used it, that in and of itself is pretty powerful metric. 282 00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:06.550 huda s: Yeah, I've just been like, I've been kind of having trouble, like finding emails to, you know, distribute them to cause like, I try to go like 283 00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:09.970 huda s: I'll try to name, like all the districts that I know, for, like the neighborhood. 284 00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:21.049 huda s: And then I just go to like their staff directory. And then, like, I find, like the person in charge of like computer science, and whatnot. And then I just like email them. But if that's. 285 00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.160 Jenny Duan: Like that's really. 286 00:45:22.645 --> 00:45:23.130 huda s: Speaker! 287 00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.220 Jenny Duan: The math teachers, too. 288 00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:33.010 huda s: Oh, maybe like statistics, t",
    "eachers maybe even cause it's like data, science kind of. 289 00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:37.832 Jenny Duan: Even like if you make it more ethics. See? You could also do like language arts, teachers, too. 290 00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.000 Jenny Duan: I feel like that's fine. 291 00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:40.900 huda s: And who? 292 00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.070 huda s: Oh, yeah, that would be, yeah. 293 00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:54.759 huda s: I can. So I can like, just keep doing that. But I just, I still feel like. It's like a really slow process. So it might be like hard for me to find, like 1,000 people. 294 00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:10.589 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, a thousand is just an arbitrary number like it could be 50, it could be a hundred. It could. Whatever is is reasonable to you. But, like the point is, just keep doing this, and the more people you reach out to the better, because it's just a vanity, metric, that's all it is. 295 00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.340 huda s: Condominium. 296 00:46:13.262 --> 00:46:18.389 Jenny Duan: But I think, like the key is trying to find those 5 schools that will actually use it and like, give you feedback. 297 00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:24.849 Jenny Duan: So if you need to go to a school board to like, ask them to do it. Maybe that's the solution. Yeah. 298 00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:34.329 Jenny Duan: okay, how some dmming people have you also been damming people about this game? Not sure if you've done that, or how that's going. 299 00:46:35.221 --> 00:46:43.339 huda s: Oh, yeah, so on linkedin I connected with so there's a girl. I think she's 300 00:46:43.540 --> 00:47:07.769 huda s: my age. But she has like this, like podcast where she talks about like women in tech and everything side. So she was gonna ask me about the and see what awards. So she connected with me. First, we're gonna answer your questions kind of vaguely. And then I was like, Oh, can you please tell me more about your podcast I'd love to learn more. And then so I kinda ",
    "introduced myself. And I said, Oh, I'd love to get involved with your 301 00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:15.810 huda s: podcast or be featured. Let me know if there's anything I can do. So possible feature there. 302 00:47:16.165 --> 00:47:27.170 huda s: But yeah, other than that, I think I've been connecting with, like a few more professionals. In game development, like, whoever like connects to me, I try to like reply. 303 00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:39.321 huda s: And just yeah, get to know them. But yeah, also, I got linkedin premium like the like the trial version. So maybe I could use like the I think 304 00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:46.339 huda s: in mails. I think they're called maybe I can use that to like publicize, empower AI. Maybe. 305 00:47:48.934 --> 00:47:53.680 Jenny Duan: You should also reach out to this person, Natasha. Dante. 306 00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:56.860 Jenny Duan: I feel like she would be pretty powerful 307 00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.520 Jenny Duan: to reach out to. 308 00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.050 Jenny Duan: And 309 00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:07.529 Jenny Duan: yeah, what do you think? 310 00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.970 huda s: Slowly. 311 00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.450 huda s: oh, wow! 312 00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:21.640 Jenny Duan: That's completely. 313 00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.400 Jenny Duan: She's also included with the alum. 314 00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.850 Jenny Duan: So and she also has a podcast 315 00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.879 Jenny Duan: so I feel like, she'll be a good person to speak to. 316 00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:32.597 huda s: That's really interesting. And then and she's 317 00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.449 huda s: she's been on the news, and she got the Nc. With award. 318 00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:37.610 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 319 00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:44.539 Jenny Duan: So I feel like she should be someone who's like a little bit inspiring for you, and also someone that can like 320 00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:49.259 Jenny Duan: speak with and and learn f",
    "rom. So you should connect and say, your codes. Clausia love 321 00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:50.350 Jenny Duan: found. 322 00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.730 Jenny Duan: If you talk to her you can say that you know me. I think she knows me, too, like 323 00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.940 Jenny Duan: we're we're like mutuals 324 00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.180 Jenny Duan: foamed. 325 00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.370 Jenny Duan: But yeah. 326 00:49:00.765 --> 00:49:05.100 Jenny Duan: okay, that's kind of all I want to go over today. Next time I wanna just finish 327 00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:17.979 Jenny Duan: like, continue looking at your camera impact scholarship application. And I also want to talk about the breakthrough challenge idea, because I think that will take you some time to like film and edit. So yeah, any other questions before you wrap for today. 328 00:49:18.538 --> 00:49:20.330 huda s: No, that's about all for today. 329 00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.749 Jenny Duan: Okay, then, sounds good. Talk to you. Soon feel free to text me if you have any questions. 330 00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.899 Jenny Duan: Bye, bye."

That's why I'm saying that you shouldn't mass email it out and make a tracker of the people who email it out to you because 279 after emailing it to like a thousand people, I think you can say that you've distributed it to them 280 and like 281 that's like a pretty metric, even if you've just distributed it like it doesn't matter if they've used it, that in and of itself is pretty powerful metric. 282"
