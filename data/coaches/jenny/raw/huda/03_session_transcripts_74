Can you hear me? Now? 20 00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.560 Jenny Duan: Can you keep talking. 21 00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:49.210 huda: Okay. Can you hear me? Now? 22 00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:58.849 Jenny Duan: Oh, there we go. Yeah, thanks, thanks so much. Thanks for sending me your calm rep ahead of time. I had a chance to look at that. So I think we can just 23 00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.829 Jenny Duan: start with that, if that's okay with you. 24 00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 25 00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.160 Jenny Duan: okay, great. So. 26 00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.858 Jenny Duan: okay, I like draft, too. 27 00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.079 Jenny Duan: Can you tell me what were the main changes between draft one and draft 2. 28 00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.390 huda: Yeah, I think draft 2 has like a more 29 00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.090 huda: kind of like 30 00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.929 huda: like a nuanced kind of like, way of thinking about it because, I think, like this. 31 00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:44.439 huda: like the main sentence that I think like really changes. It is like this one which says we don't just play video games. They play us, too. 32 00:02:44.944 --> 00:02:50.459 huda: And then, like, I guess that's kind of like the running like structure of the essay. 33 00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.669 huda: because, like each paragraph is kind of like a reason. 34 00:02:54.059 --> 00:03:06.279 huda: Kind of like then the following paragraph is about like how video games can like help me like become like a better problem solver. And it like helps me with math. 35 00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:11.710 huda: And then the next one is talking about like how video games have like taught me like switch different identities. 36 00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.279 huda: And then like it kind of like switches out of those reasons. And it starts talking about like, how like 37 00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.659 huda: video games. How like 38 00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.019 huda: I like, I was made up of my identity basically quickly became 39 00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:35.570 huda: from video games like, I'm now a problem solver. Now, I'm like someone who can easily switch roles. But now I realize that like I don't make up video games 40 00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.720 huda: and then, like I'd put the statistics there. 41 00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.810 huda: And then I talked. 42 00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:51.280 huda: I I don't remember if we discussed like adding this or not. But yeah, like, I added, like the issue with like developing synthoria. And then like 43 00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.859 huda: and like, I think it's like the same as like the other draft. But I think, like, 44 00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.459 huda: yeah, it's pretty much the same 45 00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:06.120 huda: and then like after that is like the one where I talk about like the women in games workshop, and like the 46 00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:12.959 huda: and like the games for change one. And I think, like this paragraph is a lot more like 47 00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.950 huda: like. 48 00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.969 huda: I think it's like a lot more like related to the essay rather than the other one, because I feel like the other. One's also kind of like a 49 00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.190 huda: like the draft. One is kind of like an info dump like, oh, yeah, I did this workshop. I I wrote this review, but like. 50 00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:37.639 huda: I think this one like is more like weeped into, like the actual meaning cause like the end games workshop like showed me like different perspectives of other people and like at the same time, I just talked about like 51 00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.770 huda: how it's like an international thing. And then I also like I 52 00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:55.689 huda: might have like I I don't really like the way like I put in, like the dumb ways to die like games for change. Review like. I feel like if I could fix that. But other than that, it's like those are like the main differences. 53 00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.867 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it looks great. 54 00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:09.290 Jenny Duan: I think that let's actually go through it from the beginning and look really carefully, line by line, and then 55 00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.260 Jenny Duan: I looked at it yesterday, and I feel like there aren't any main changes that I would like to implement. But I do feel like there are like 56 00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.999 Jenny Duan: line by line, small things that we could change. How does that sound. 57 00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.389 huda: Yeah, that sounds good. 58 00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.020 Jenny Duan: Okay. 59 00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.460 Jenny Duan: By 7 Pm.

It's not clear that that's like an offering. 79 00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:06.179 Jenny Duan: You feel like that's more of a fact. Like I'm not sure if I would say like, Oh, this offered me 3 million pixels. I would just say like this has 3 million pixels, so 80 00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.729 Jenny Duan: maybe we could change that into like 81 00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.270 Jenny Duan: I I 82 00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.606 Jenny Duan: like 83 00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.220 Jenny Duan: I didn't know it would offer me 84 00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.230 Jenny Duan: something else 85 00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.439 Jenny Duan: within 3 like 3 million pixels. 86 00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.040 huda: Maybe like much more than like entertainment. 87 00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.920 Jenny Duan: So yeah. 88 00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.989 Jenny Duan: I don't know if we should say entertainment as like primary thing. 89 00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.630 Jenny Duan: And 90 00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.779 Jenny Duan: how's this?

Maybe. 166 00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.859 Jenny Duan: Maybe you just use 2 different words. 167 00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.890 huda: So like, which so like should I keep the constitute in the second part. 168 00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.170 Jenny Duan: I think so. 169 00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.030 Jenny Duan: We can say like. 170 00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.769 Jenny Duan: and since with me I didn't embody anything. 171 00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.930 Jenny Duan: No, I think 172 00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.239 Jenny Duan: foundation here. 173 00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.559 huda: Yeah, that definitely sounds better. 174 00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.480 Jenny Duan: It's good. 175 00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.320 huda: Thanks. 176 00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.210 Jenny Duan: Great 177 00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.940 Jenny Duan: great 178 00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.420 Jenny Duan: How many words is this. 179 00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.800 huda: Last time I was like 200 over almost. 180 00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.269 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's now, it's 8 22. So it's yeah, almost 200 over. 181 00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.090 huda: Yeah, it's like a hundred, 72 over. 182 00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:33.760 Jenny Duan: Okay, I'm gonna delete this sentence. I feel like you talk about this later. And it doesn't relate directly to the next paragraph. 183 00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.469 Jenny Duan: Yeah, what do you think. 184 00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:36.869 huda: Yeah, I got you. 185 00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.279 huda: And then I'm just gonna change this to approach. 186 00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.430 huda: Oh, no, I approach you the same 187 00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.610 huda: strategy. 188 00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.449 huda: Maybe like I could cut this down by saying like, 5% are Asian. 189 00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.530 Jenny Duan: that would save one word. 190 00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.899 Jenny Duan: If you think that's important. 191 00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.070 huda: like what one word. 192 00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.829 Jenny Duan: And 5% are Asian. That would just save one word. 193 00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.230 huda: Oh. 194 00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.320 huda: yeah. 195 00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.769 Jenny Duan: So if you think. But if you think that that's representative, you can do that. But it's not gonna save like the time. 196 00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:24.755 huda: Yeah, 197 00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.159 huda: I don't know. Like, does this? Does this like 198 00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.469 huda: makes sense? Or is it just like. 199 00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.300 Jenny Duan: It makes sense. No, it makes sense. 200 00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.170 huda: Okay. 201 00:24:25.322 --> 00:24:27.339 huda: and then I can just delete this right. 202 00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.340 Jenny Duan: yeah. 203 00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:48.559 Jenny Duan: I feel like here you can. You have an opportunity to write like some some more description about yourself? Maybe, instead of saying who I am? Because you asked this question, who am I? You can say video games quickly become the being the foundation of my 204 00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.490 Jenny Duan: or like. 205 00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.909 Jenny Duan: you know curiosity whatever whatever, or something fundamental about you 206 00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.290 Jenny Duan: of my identity, or like something about you. 207 00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.780 huda: Yeah, I think curiosity 208 00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.320 huda: sounds good. 209 00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:06.990 Jenny Duan: Great. 210 00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.370 huda: And do I list a couple or just curiosity. 211 00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.620 Jenny Duan: Up to you. 212 00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.380 Jenny Duan: I'm gonna say that. 213 00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.510 huda: When 214 00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.700 huda: maybe just like start it here. 215 00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.800 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that works 216 00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.099 Jenny Duan: wait. Only 15 more words left to cut. 217 00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:22.370 huda: Yes. 218 00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.430 huda: Maybe it's just found myself like I could see like I started hesitating. 219 00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.320 Jenny Duan: Maybe. Yeah. Hi 220 00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.950 Jenny Duan: hesitated, or something. 221 00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:11.830 huda: And maybe, instead of doing Sana and Yasmin, I could just do like just Suna, or just Yasmin. 222 00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.740 Jenny Duan: I think it's I think it's fine. 223 00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.460 huda: Okay. 224 00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.029 huda: I feel like, I want to replace this part of the sentence. 225 00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.350 Jenny Duan: Okay. 226 00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.360 huda: could I say something like? But the real magic was what happened after. 227 00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.400 Jenny Duan: yeah, that seems good. 228 00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.510 huda: Oh, it's exactly 6 50 words now. 229 00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.480 Jenny Duan: Oh, perfect. 230 00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.390 Jenny Duan: Okay. 231 00:30:28.287 --> 00:30:34.320 Jenny Duan: Can you read this out loud in your own voice? Just let me see if it sounds like natural. 232 00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:48.120 huda: By 7 PM. I've baked 10 cakes, fed my sheep, discovered diamonds the next hour I'm managing a pizza franchise, generating a 7 figure income at 7 a budding entrepreneur. 233 00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:53.570 huda: If only my parents knew about my lucrative virtual empires, they might have reconsidered my allowance. 234 00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.270 huda: When I 1st picked up the ipad my sister and I shared. 235 00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:04.050 huda: I didn't know it would offer me much more than 3,145,728 pixels 236 00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:08.100 huda: instead, it became a lens through which I learned to decode the real world. 237 00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.270 huda: We don't just play video games. They play us, too. 238 00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.939 huda: When I solved this complex Redstone circuit in Minecraft. 239 00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:23.209 huda: creating an creating an automatic farm that resembled the one on the one on my way to the grocery store. 240 00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.220 huda: Okay, yeah. This this far doesn't really match. 241 00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.095 huda: Oh. 242 00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:40.099 Jenny Duan: I I still actually think the 1st part was fine, but, like the mechanics of the grocery store, I felt like it was. 243 00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:46.350 Jenny Duan: I mean, decide the mechanics of the game. No matter, and I feel like that makes sense to me. But 244 00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.510 Jenny Duan: alright! And then. 245 00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.300 huda: Oh. 246 00:32:03.844 --> 00:32:05.500 huda: also I feel like 247 00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.120 huda: I think I don't need the word creating. I think. 248 00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.200 Jenny Duan: Okay. 249 00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.710 huda: Let me just see how many words. 250 00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.550 huda: Oh, this is 654, right. 251 00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:25.020 Jenny Duan: It's fine. Just keep on reading like when we're at that forward stage. It's very easy to eliminate it elsewhere. 252 00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:36.459 huda: When I solved a complex Redstone circuit in Minecraft, an automatic form that resembles the one on my way to the grocery store. It wasn't just the game's mechanics that mattered. 253 00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.730 huda: It was my statistic homework that night 254 00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:48.650 huda: when, faced with a tricky, graphing problem, I approached it the same with the same strategy. Step by step, like placing redstone components. I plotted analytics on the axes. 255 00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:55.080 huda: Even this past summer at Data Science Camp. I saw Redstone every time I fed data into the regression models. 256 00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.789 huda: People praise games for the immersive experience, but they often miss the point. 257 00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:07.500 huda: It's how we carry that immersion into the real life that matters how it bleeds into our decision, making our approaches to problem solving. 258 00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:13.320 huda: Soon it became a routine switching from a gladiator to a manager faster than you can press alt Tab. 259 00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:28.229 huda: Perhaps it's the same innate ability that allows me to switch between Urdu and English without a second thought or from technical jargon, at hackathons, to advocacy, at advocacy, at journalism conferences. 260 00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:37.059 huda: Each role comes with its own set of expectations and and rules of engagement. Who am I, when not bound to one narrative, one language or one role. 261 00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:51.529 huda: Video games quickly became the foundation of my curiosity. But me, I didn't constitute video games when 79.2% of characters are male and Muslim communities are villainized. I couldn't find characters who looked like me. 262 00:33:51.550 --> 00:34:05.310 huda: Cynthoria was born out of realization. An Rpg. That teaches data, science, and AI ethics. But as I created my characters I hesitated. Should I name them Sona and Yasmin, or play it safe with Ashley and Ava. 263 00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:15.809 huda: Would people relate to brown skinned characters, or would their names be stumbling blocks, after all? Aren't most most of us conditioned to play it safe to blend in rather than to stand out. 264 00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:21.370 huda: But here's the thing. Games ask us to become someone else. All the time 265 00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:31.169 huda: I've played as a detective raccoon in an Nba. All star. I'm not, to my knowledge, a detective raccoon, but that didn't stop me from solving mysteries from his perspective. 266 00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:36.200 huda: Why, then, should it matter if my characters are named Senna or Yasmin? 267 00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:42.430 huda: I chose them, knowing their presence would be more than a statement. It would be an invitation. 268 00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:51.450 huda: That decision echoed in the women in games workshop. I later hosted representation meant different things in the participants. Respective countries. 269 00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.479 huda: while a developer from Algeria argued that 270 00:34:54.650 --> 00:35:16.620 huda: for de-radicalization in games like call of duty. An artist from France combated the submissive depiction of women in games. I noticed the same hesitation in their voices as they blurted out the ideas, but much like designing a serenas mean for me it didn't stop them. As I leafed through the pitches I noticed their ability to transform advocacy into engagement. 271 00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:35.390 huda: In the end. Isn't life the ultimate open world game? We're all live players switching between roles, acquiring new skills and facing unexpected challenges. My journey through virtual worlds has prepared me for the complexities of identity and importance of representation. 272 00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:41.300 huda: As I look at the future, I see myself continuing to bridge worlds in technology, culture and society. 273 00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:54.570 huda: whether it's through game development, creating animated websites or crafting content that resonates with other women in tech. I hope to design experiences where everyone can level up regardless of their starting stats. All you have to do is press flight. 274 00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.610 Jenny Duan: Oh, this is so good. 275 00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.569 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how do you feel? 276 00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:06.240 huda: Yeah, I really like, like, I really like how this turned out, I think and like. 277 00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.480 huda: it's definitely, really different from like my 1st draft that I did 278 00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.320 Jenny Duan: I feel like, it sounds really new. 279 00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 280 00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:17.840 Jenny Duan: yeah. 281 00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.809 Jenny Duan: do you feel like it sounds like you. And like, does it? Do you feel like it feels like you. 282 00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.529 huda: Yeah, I think it's 283 00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.980 huda: really like. 284 00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:34.059 huda: also, like introspective, like, there's like a lot of questions that I ask like, I'm being like 285 00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.579 huda: being forced or not like taught, or like taught to like blend in 286 00:36:39.752 --> 00:36:50.119 huda: and then the part where I talk about like, who am I when I'm not like bounded by one thing, and I think like that is like a big part of me and so I'm I'm glad that gets like. 287 00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.678 huda: kind of vocalize here. And then, 288 00:36:53.540 --> 00:37:10.279 huda: I just yeah, like, I actually don't know how like our common app, like personal statements, did. They usually like have a little more humor than this, because I feel like like some of the examples you showed are a little like funnier, but like I don't know if it's because, like my topics, like, really different. But 289 00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:11.530 huda: yeah. 290 00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:17.136 Jenny Duan: I don't know. I I don't think that matters so much. 291 00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:22.980 Jenny Duan: My per. My personal stream is personally like not funny at all. So 292 00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:27.417 Jenny Duan: I think it just depends on like you. Yeah. 293 00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.140 huda: I mean, I think it's I think it's free representation. 294 00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.670 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 295 00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:35.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 296 00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.589 Jenny Duan: Okay, we have 4 words, 4 words 297 00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.260 Jenny Duan: to cut 298 00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.239 Jenny Duan: it. Just cut in 299 00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.600 Jenny Duan: one word. 300 00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.550 huda: Maybe just generating 7 figures at 7. 301 00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.719 huda: Does that make sense. 302 00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:21.439 Jenny Duan: It's I think it's fine. I think I fixed it. I I changed like the women games, workshop, part. 303 00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.980 huda: Oh, okay. 304 00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.475 Jenny Duan: Great 305 00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:45.000 Jenny Duan: Can you just do one more read through personally like, just read it through one more time, and I'm gonna read it through one more time, too, and see if you can identify any spots that still feel a bit sticky. 306 00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:14.799 huda: Oh, yeah, sorry to interrupt. But like one thing I was like worrying about, for, like the 1st draft as well is that like I mentioned like 7, like 3 times like by 7 pm. 7 figure income at 7 years old. And so I was wondering if, like that might like make the reader think that, like 7 is significant, and in the essay. 307 00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.570 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, maybe it's 308 00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.270 Jenny Duan: so. 309 00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.569 Jenny Duan: 8 pm. 310 00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:32.170 Jenny Duan: I think this is fine. 2 instances of the word sevens. 311 00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.920 huda: Yeah, I think that's funny as well. 312 00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:41.980 huda: Okay. And then I think, like the last step with this, if, like, we could finalize this 313 00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.890 huda: maybe like like which prompt matches it the best. 314 00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:53.380 Jenny Duan: Let's do that right now. What are the like? Possible prompts? Do you have them up right now? 315 00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.279 huda: Oh, yeah, let me. 316 00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.370 huda: I'll put them in the zoom chat. 317 00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.600 huda: Oh, interesting. 318 00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.419 huda: and let's see. 319 00:44:41.950 --> 00:45:10.564 huda: Yeah, I'm just realizing, like the topic of this essay. I think we like brainstormed a really similar idea like a while back, for I think I had like an English assignment for like college. Or let me see, it was like the common assignment, and it was like pretty much the same about like challenging how like we can learn and then I challenge. And those, it's like a little different, because I talk more about like how like video games can be like educational. But 320 00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.469 huda: It was like like the same premise. I think. 321 00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.820 Jenny Duan: I think maybe, can you describe a topic idea or concept. 322 00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.430 huda: Oh, yeah, I think 323 00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.372 huda: I yeah, I think that one's 324 00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.779 huda: got the most thing. 325 00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.580 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 326 00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.709 Jenny Duan: yeah, I feel like that's a good fit. 327 00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.830 Jenny Duan: Yay. 328 00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.082 huda: Oh, my gosh! I can't believe that. 329 00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.129 Jenny Duan: I'm so proud of you, Huda. It's almost done. 330 00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.290 Jenny Duan: You're almost done. 331 00:45:57.970 --> 00:45:58.600 huda: Yeah. 332 00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.179 huda: I don't know. It doesn't feel real. 333 00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.050 Jenny Duan: How show your dad it? Because 334 00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.678 Jenny Duan: I feel like it's 335 00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.849 Jenny Duan: like his feedback also really matters. So 336 00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.440 Jenny Duan: yeah, see what he says. 337 00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:14.750 huda: Yeah. 338 00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.090 huda: Hmm. 339 00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:23.289 huda: and since we have a little bit of time, maybe we can look at the Unc. Supplementals. 340 00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:25.559 Jenny Duan: Yeah, do you have a link to that. 341 00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.790 huda: Hmm. 342 00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.189 huda: should I share it to your personal account as well. 343 00:46:35.138 --> 00:46:38.249 Jenny Duan: I think my Iv mentors is working today. 344 00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:52.520 huda: Oh, yeah, the 1st one was the the Dumbledore essay, which, like, I guess we can like change that. 345 00:46:52.740 --> 00:47:00.330 huda: And then this one I did like. I use the Stanford essay for like the like the curiosity essay. 346 00:47:00.892 --> 00:47:02.069 huda: But I think 347 00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:08.009 huda: I'm not sure if, like I'm supposed to approach it this way. But I also like mentioned a couple of things specific to Unc 348 00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.179 huda: and like 349 00:47:09.625 --> 00:47:14.679 huda: kind of like weaving in like things that are unique about you and seeing like. Why. 350 00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.640 huda: like my curiosity can be like, answered with Unc. 351 00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:21.443 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 352 00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.340 Jenny Duan: can you put the link in the chat? Thank you. Linda. 353 00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.410 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 354 00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.220 Jenny Duan: thanks. 355 00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:46.540 Jenny Duan: Just 356 00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:24.189 Jenny Duan: okay. I feel like this is asking you to describe one of your personal qualities. And so I'm not exactly clear what personal quality you're showing here. 357 00:48:26.427 --> 00:48:30.092 huda: I guess I was trying to like highlight like 358 00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:38.710 huda: like adaptability, and like how like in different like audiences like, for example, and like Sunday school, and then like 359 00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.550 huda: like virtual places. 360 00:48:41.954 --> 00:48:53.499 huda: and then also like online to like promote business like my different like audiences. And like, I'm using different platforms like leverage that. But yeah, I can see like how 361 00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:57.089 huda: that might not be as like, well, like highlighted here. 362 00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:03.310 Jenny Duan: Now I feel like in this instance, the dumbledore analogy might feel a little bit distracting, because 363 00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:06.610 Jenny Duan: it's yeah. It can be a little bit hard to tell, like, what 364 00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:12.800 Jenny Duan: exactly, is your personal quality here? Beyond, like this whole dumbledore story. 365 00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:14.810 huda: Yeah, I agree. 366 00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.839 Jenny Duan: So maybe we can just unwrap it from the dumbledore like, I feel like this. 367 00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.209 Jenny Duan: like essay is good. If we just 368 00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.909 Jenny Duan: maybe take out the Dumblator aspect. 369 00:49:33.494 --> 00:49:36.010 Jenny Duan: Is there another way? You can start this. 370 00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.120 Jenny Duan: This is great. Yeah, like, this is good. 371 00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 372 00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.869 Jenny Duan: change this question to a different question. 373 00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:10.149 huda: Maybe like I could like, do like some repetition. And so like after each time, like, I'm like deciding like, how do I approach this, I could be like, what's my plan of action? And then I can like like 374 00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.360 huda: like. 375 00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:18.220 huda: there's no AI ethics education. What's my plan of action, and then I could be like. 376 00:50:18.769 --> 00:50:28.649 huda: lack of groceries and restaurants turn my community into small business trove. What's my plan of action? And then maybe it could be repetition. But I don't know if that's 377 00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:31.710 huda: like, if that's really relevant. But. 378 00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:42.710 Jenny Duan: I feel like since are you? Are you highlighting your curiosity, your what if you could name one trait? What would you say? You're highlighting, or one to 3 traits. 379 00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.279 huda: I guess, like my adaptability. 380 00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.560 Jenny Duan: Okay. 381 00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.500 Jenny Duan: yeah. 382 00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.200 Jenny Duan: Then. 383 00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:55.510 Jenny Duan: yeah, I feel like the repetition could be effective. I'd like to see what it looks like. 384 00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:21.059 huda: Oh, this sentence could be like. 385 00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:31.110 huda: Can I drop like a statistic about like if AI ethics is like taught in 386 00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:32.810 huda: classrooms. 387 00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.333 Jenny Duan: Go for it. Yeah. 388 00:51:52.670 --> 00:52:04.080 huda: Hmm! Actually, I don't know if this will work, because, unlike the statistic, is saying that like 15% of Us. Colleges teach AI ethics. And then, like. 389 00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:12.610 huda: I don't know if, like a video game really like looks like it's being made for college students like, I don't know if, like, the person would understand that. 390 00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:25.149 Jenny Duan: Maybe maybe don't write about universities, because then it challenges like, okay, I don't know how robust 391 00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.619 Jenny Duan: Unc's ethics program is. So maybe like that wouldn't be good if they don't move forward. 392 00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.890 huda: Yeah. 393 00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:37.709 huda: I think we do have like AI ethics classes. But like I, I just, I also don't think it like 394 00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.700 huda: fits to us. 395 00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:41.050 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 396 00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.640 huda: You seem to find anything about like elementary schools. 397 00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 398 00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:40.600 huda: Maybe I could do something like 399 00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.380 huda: like. 400 00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.510 huda: just for example, like 3 and 4 401 00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:51.830 huda: children are exposed to AI every day, but they don't like. 402 00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:56.800 huda: but they don't understand like the ethics behind it, or something like that. 403 00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:06.960 Jenny Duan: Wait. I don't know if that is effective in this case, like I, I feel like it might be just distracting from your game. 404 00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:21.210 huda: I wanna like, like, I guess, kind of present like a problem. And then, like, I ask, what's my plan of action? And then I show how I solved it through like these different mediums. 405 00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:22.570 Jenny Duan: Right. 406 00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:29.930 huda: So like, the problem is that like AI, ethics isn't being taught and like, neither is 407 00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:34.359 huda: like. But just like data. Science are to younger people 408 00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:39.490 huda: like, even like lack of access to like tech education. 409 00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.160 huda: that's like 410 00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.889 huda: impacting like that's like the reason why I wanted to create synthoria. 411 00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:54.219 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe you can. I don't know if you would have to lead with it here, but maybe here 412 00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.080 Jenny Duan: would be a good place. 413 00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:02.900 Jenny Duan: because I feel like if you lead with it, it might distract the reader from like what you've done and like, I don't know if 414 00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.219 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm trying to think about the placement. But what are your thoughts. 415 00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:22.850 huda: Yeah, I I like, I think it'll definitely fit better there. But then I'll probably have to think. Then I think like maybe repetition might not be like or like. At least that question shouldn't be like my main question. That's being repeated. 416 00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.541 huda: because, like, I guess, I can see how like 417 00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.380 huda: like me tackling a problem isn't too evident in like 418 00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.580 huda: the other 2 paragraphs. 419 00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.300 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 420 00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.320 Jenny Duan: Oh. 421 00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:53.019 Jenny Duan: okay, maybe we can think about different transitions to these 2 sentences. First, st like, just to get rid of the double door analogy before we start remaking the rest of the lesson. 422 00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:54.180 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 423 00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:09.230 huda: okay, wait. 424 00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:38.100 huda: Hmm, yeah. I think this is where like repetition might be helpful. So it provides a good 425 00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:41.659 huda: easier transition between each of the paragraphs. 426 00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 427 00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.850 huda: Yeah, I just wanna I wanna figure out like, what 428 00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:51.049 huda: like, the question should be. 429 00:56:51.510 --> 00:57:04.190 huda: because I think that's like important and okay, so it could either be like, what's my plan of action? Which actually, it might be easier to like implement that into the folklift paragraph, but not the centurial paragraph. 430 00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.909 huda: just because, like as you said, like, the the statistics might be distracting. 431 00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.210 huda: But, like the question could be 432 00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:23.230 huda: like, in other words, like just saying like, How do I adapt, or how do I? 433 00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:28.050 huda: How do I pivot? Maybe. 434 00:57:42.185 --> 00:57:51.390 Jenny Duan: okay, I think that the 1st thing we should just get I just want to get rid of all of these double door references, and I feel like your story is fine, if you just like. 435 00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:53.890 Jenny Duan: for all here is. 436 00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.479 Jenny Duan: and then from here to pivot. 437 00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:57.660 Jenny Duan: Hold on! 438 00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:01.620 Jenny Duan: I feel like this essay. Doubt 439 00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:07.620 Jenny Duan: is good, but it's not interesting now that we've gotten rid of all the double door stuff. So we need to find like a new 440 00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.560 Jenny Duan: way to make it interesting. 441 00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:48.469 huda: This might be too much of a stretch. But I could be like, yeah, actually, this is a lot of a stretch. But just like to say the idea. Like. 442 00:58:48.710 --> 00:59:13.343 huda: I guess I'm kind of like memory, and that, like everyone kind of like, has like a different okay, well, I feel like it has different implications. If I say I'm like a memory, it kind of sounds like I'm dead. But like, I think like. What I meant to say is that like different people have, like different perceptions of like memories, and then like 443 00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:19.839 huda: I guess by doing like these different like mediums, and like different ways of like 444 00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:23.939 huda: teaching and helping people. It's like. 445 00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:28.770 huda: I guess, like different perceptions. But I I don't really like that analogy. 446 00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:37.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 447 00:59:54.630 --> 01:00:00.329 Jenny Duan: So they have 12 words. Well, so that means we probably need to cut some stuff as well. 448 01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:05.889 huda: I think I could definitely cut a lot from this in Thoria. Paragraph. 449 01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:42.489 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think you you're right. You need some explanation of this paragraph about why you built centuria. 450 01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.260 Jenny Duan: And then 451 01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.830 Jenny Duan: let's start with that and come back to this tomorrow. 452 01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.670 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 453 01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.670 huda: Yeah. 454 01:00:56.070 --> 01:01:09.780 huda: should I like start like, I feel like the best way to like, like, as I say, is like, start with a problem. And then like synthesize a solution. So maybe like, instead of like statistics, which might be like a little distracting like. 455 01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:12.740 huda: I could just like make a statement. Maybe. 456 01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:19.829 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I agree. I feel like, like a blanket statement would be good. 457 01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:30.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, I have to go now because of another 9 30, but feel free to text me any questions, and we should reconvene tomorrow to talk about this essay 458 01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:33.440 Jenny Duan: again. I think we already have a meeting. 459 01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.376 Jenny Duan: No, I don't think we have a meeting set. 460 01:01:39.785 --> 01:01:45.099 Jenny Duan: I will text you about a meeting time, but I have to go now because I have a conflicting meeting. 461 01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:48.520 Jenny Duan: But yeah, I'll see you soon. Alright, bye! 462 01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:49.599 Jenny Duan: Congrats on your phone.",

So I think we can just 23 00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.829 Jenny Duan: start with that, if that's okay with you. 24 00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.080 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 25 00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.160 Jenny Duan: okay, great.

    "een draft one and draft 2. 28 00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.390 huda: Yeah, I think draft 2 has like a more 29 00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.090 huda: kind of like 30 00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.929 huda: like a nuanced kind of like, way of thinking about it because, I think, like this. 31 00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:44.439 huda: like the main sentence that I think like really changes. It is like this one which says we don't just play video games. They play us, too. 32 00:02:44.944 --> 00:02:50.459 huda: And then, like, I guess that's kind of like the running like structure of the essay. 33 00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.669 huda: because, like each paragraph is kind of like a reason. 34 00:02:54.059 --> 00:03:06.279 huda: Kind of like then the following paragraph is about like how video games can like help me like become like a better problem solver. And it like helps me with math. 35 00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:11.710 huda: And then the next one is talking about like how video games have like taught me like switch different identities. 36 00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.279 huda: And then like it kind of like switches out of those reasons. And it starts talking about like, how like 37 00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.659 huda: video games. How like 38 00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.019 huda: I like, I was made up of my identity basically quickly became 39 00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:35.570 huda: from video games like, I'm now a problem solver. Now, I'm like someone who can easily switch roles. But now I realize that like I don't make up video games 40 00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.720 huda: and then, like I'd put the statistics there. 41 00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.810 huda: And then I talked. 42 00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:51.280 huda: I I don't remember if we discussed like adding this or not. But yeah, like, I added, like the issue with like developing synthoria. And then like 43 00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.859 huda: and like, I think it's like the same as like the other draft. But I think, like, 44 00:03:58.530 --> 00:0",
    "4:00.459 huda: yeah, it's pretty much the same 45 00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:06.120 huda: and then like after that is like the one where I talk about like the women in games workshop, and like the 46 00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:12.959 huda: and like the games for change one. And I think, like this paragraph is a lot more like 47 00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.950 huda: like. 48 00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.969 huda: I think it's like a lot more like related to the essay rather than the other one, because I feel like the other. One's also kind of like a 49 00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.190 huda: like the draft. One is kind of like an info dump like, oh, yeah, I did this workshop. I I wrote this review, but like. 50 00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:37.639 huda: I think this one like is more like weeped into, like the actual meaning cause like the end games workshop like showed me like different perspectives of other people and like at the same time, I just talked about like 51 00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.770 huda: how it's like an international thing. And then I also like I 52 00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:55.689 huda: might have like I I don't really like the way like I put in, like the dumb ways to die like games for change. Review like. I feel like if I could fix that. But other than that, it's like those are like the main differences. 53 00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.867 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think it looks great. 54 00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:09.290 Jenny Duan: I think that let's actually go through it from the beginning and look really carefully, line by line, and then 55 00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.260 Jenny Duan: I looked at it yesterday, and I feel like there aren't any main changes that I would like to implement. But I do feel like there are like 56 00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.999 Jenny Duan: line by line, small things that we could change. How does that sound. 57 00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.389 huda: Yeah, that sounds good. 58 00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.020 Jenny Duan: Okay. 59 00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.460 Jenny",

But it's not gonna save like the time. 196 00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:24.755 huda: Yeah, 197 00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.159 huda: I don't know. Like, does this? Does this like 198 00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.469 huda: makes sense? Or is it just like. 199 00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.300 Jenny Duan: It makes sense. No, it makes sense. 200 00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.170 huda: Okay. 201 00:24:25.322 --> 00:24:27.339 huda: and then I can just delete this right. 202 00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.340 Jenny Duan: yeah. 203 00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:48.559 Jenny Duan: I feel like here you can. You have an opportunity to write like some some more description about yourself? Maybe, instead of saying who I am? Because you asked this question, who am I? You can say video games quickly become the being the foundation of my 204 00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.490 Jenny Duan: or like. 205 00:24:50.580 ",

Only 15 more words left to cut. 217 00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:22.370 huda: Yes. 218 00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.430 huda: Maybe it's just found myself like I could see like I started hesitating. 219 00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.320 Jenny Duan: Maybe. Yeah. Hi 220 00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.950 Jenny Duan: hesitated, or something. 221 00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:11.830 huda: And maybe, instead of doing Sana and Yasmin, I could just do like just Suna, or just Yasmin. 222 00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.740 Jenny Duan: I think it's I think it's fine. 223 00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.460 huda: Okay. 224 00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.029 huda: I feel like, I want to replace this part of the sentence. 225 00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.350 Jenny Duan: Okay. 226 00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.360 huda: could I say something like? But the real magic was what happened after. 227 00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.400 Jenny Duan: yeah, that seems good. 228 00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.510 huda: Oh, it's exactly 6 50 words now. 229 00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.480 Jenny Duan: Oh, perfect. 230 00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.390 Jenny Duan: Okay. 231 00:30:28.287 --> 00:30:34.320 Jenny Duan: Can you read this out loud in your own voice? Just let me se",
    "e if it sounds like natural. 232 00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:48.120 huda: By 7 PM. I've baked 10 cakes, fed my sheep, discovered diamonds the next hour I'm managing a pizza franchise, generating a 7 figure income at 7 a budding entrepreneur. 233 00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:53.570 huda: If only my parents knew about my lucrative virtual empires, they might have reconsidered my allowance. 234 00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.270 huda: When I 1st picked up the ipad my sister and I shared. 235 00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:04.050 huda: I didn't know it would offer me much more than 3,145,728 pixels 236 00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:08.100 huda: instead, it became a lens through which I learned to decode the real world. 237 00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.270 huda: We don't just play video games. They play us, too. 238 00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.939 huda: When I solved this complex Redstone circuit in Minecraft. 239 00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:23.209 huda: creating an creating an automatic farm that resembled the one on the one on my way to the grocery store. 240 00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.220 huda: Okay, yeah. This this far doesn't really match. 241 00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.095 huda: Oh. 242 00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:40.099 Jenny Duan: I I still actually think the 1st part was fine, but, like the mechanics of the grocery store, I felt like it was. 243 00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:46.350 Jenny Duan: I mean, decide the mechanics of the game. No matter, and I feel like that makes sense to me. But 244 00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.510 Jenny Duan: alright! And then. 245 00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.300 huda: Oh. 246 00:32:03.844 --> 00:32:05.500 huda: also I feel like 247 00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.120 huda: I think I don't need the word creating. I think. 248 00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.200 Jenny Duan: Okay. 249 00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.710 huda: Let me just see how many words. 250 00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.550 huda: Oh, this is 654, right. 251 00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:25.020 Jenny Duan: It's fine. Just keep on reading like when we're ",
    "at that forward stage. It's very easy to eliminate it elsewhere. 252 00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:36.459 huda: When I solved a complex Redstone circuit in Minecraft, an automatic form that resembles the one on my way to the grocery store. It wasn't just the game's mechanics that mattered. 253 00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.730 huda: It was my statistic homework that night 254 00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:48.650 huda: when, faced with a tricky, graphing problem, I approached it the same with the same strategy. Step by step, like placing redstone components. I plotted analytics on the axes. 255 00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:55.080 huda: Even this past summer at Data Science Camp. I saw Redstone every time I fed data into the regression models. 256 00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.789 huda: People praise games for the immersive experience, but they often miss the point. 257 00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:07.500 huda: It's how we carry that immersion into the real life that matters how it bleeds into our decision, making our approaches to problem solving. 258 00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:13.320 huda: Soon it became a routine switching from a gladiator to a manager faster than you can press alt Tab. 259 00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:28.229 huda: Perhaps it's the same innate ability that allows me to switch between Urdu and English without a second thought or from technical jargon, at hackathons, to advocacy, at advocacy, at journalism conferences. 260 00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:37.059 huda: Each role comes with its own set of expectations and and rules of engagement. Who am I, when not bound to one narrative, one language or one role. 261 00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:51.529 huda: Video games quickly became the foundation of my curiosity. But me, I didn't constitute video games when 79.2% of characters are male and Muslim communities are villainized. I couldn't find characters who looked like me. 262 00:33:51.550 --> 00:34:05.310 huda: Cynthoria was born out of realization. An Rpg. That teaches data, science, and AI ethics. But as I",
    " created my characters I hesitated. Should I name them Sona and Yasmin, or play it safe with Ashley and Ava. 263 00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:15.809 huda: Would people relate to brown skinned characters, or would their names be stumbling blocks, after all? Aren't most most of us conditioned to play it safe to blend in rather than to stand out. 264 00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:21.370 huda: But here's the thing. Games ask us to become someone else. All the time 265 00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:31.169 huda: I've played as a detective raccoon in an Nba. All star. I'm not, to my knowledge, a detective raccoon, but that didn't stop me from solving mysteries from his perspective. 266 00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:36.200 huda: Why, then, should it matter if my characters are named Senna or Yasmin? 267 00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:42.430 huda: I chose them, knowing their presence would be more than a statement. It would be an invitation. 268 00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:51.450 huda: That decision echoed in the women in games workshop. I later hosted representation meant different things in the participants. Respective countries. 269 00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.479 huda: while a developer from Algeria argued that 270 00:34:54.650 --> 00:35:16.620 huda: for de-radicalization in games like call of duty. An artist from France combated the submissive depiction of women in games. I noticed the same hesitation in their voices as they blurted out the ideas, but much like designing a serenas mean for me it didn't stop them. As I leafed through the pitches I noticed their ability to transform advocacy into engagement. 271 00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:35.390 huda: In the end. Isn't life the ultimate open world game? We're all live players switching between roles, acquiring new skills and facing unexpected challenges. My journey through virtual worlds has prepared me for the complexities of identity and importance of representation. 272 00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:41.300 huda: As I look at the future, I see myself continuing to bridge ",
    "worlds in technology, culture and society. 273 00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:54.570 huda: whether it's through game development, creating animated websites or crafting content that resonates with other women in tech. I hope to design experiences where everyone can level up regardless of their starting stats. All you have to do is press flight. 274 00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.610 Jenny Duan: Oh, this is so good. 275 00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.569 Jenny Duan: Yeah, how do you feel? 276 00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:06.240 huda: Yeah, I really like, like, I really like how this turned out, I think and like. 277 00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.480 huda: it's definitely, really different from like my 1st draft that I did 278 00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.320 Jenny Duan: I feel like, it sounds really new. 279 00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 280 00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:17.840 Jenny Duan: yeah. 281 00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.809 Jenny Duan: do you feel like it sounds like you. And like, does it? Do you feel like it feels like you. 282 00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.529 huda: Yeah, I think it's 283 00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.980 huda: really like. 284 00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:34.059 huda: also, like introspective, like, there's like a lot of questions that I ask like, I'm being like 285 00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.579 huda: being forced or not like taught, or like taught to like blend in 286 00:36:39.752 --> 00:36:50.119 huda: and then the part where I talk about like, who am I when I'm not like bounded by one thing, and I think like that is like a big part of me and so I'm I'm glad that gets like. 287 00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.678 huda: kind of vocalize here. And then, 288 00:36:53.540 --> 00:37:10.279 huda: I just yeah, like, I actually don't know how like our common app, like personal statements, did. They usually like have a little more humor than this, because I feel like like some of the examples you showed are a little like funnier, but like I don't know if it's because, like my topics, lik",
    "e, really different. But 289 00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:11.530 huda: yeah. 290 00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:17.136 Jenny Duan: I don't know. I I don't think that matters so much. 291 00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:22.980 Jenny Duan: My per. My personal stream is personally like not funny at all. So 292 00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:27.417 Jenny Duan: I think it just depends on like you. Yeah. 293 00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.140 huda: I mean, I think it's I think it's free representation. 294 00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.670 Jenny Duan: Thank you. 295 00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:35.980 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 296 00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.589 Jenny Duan: Okay, we have 4 words, 4 words 297 00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.260 Jenny Duan: to cut 298 00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.239 Jenny Duan: it. Just cut in 299 00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.600 Jenny Duan: one word. 300 00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.550 huda: Maybe just generating 7 figures at 7. 301 00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.719 huda: Does that make sense. 302 00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:21.439 Jenny Duan: It's I think it's fine. I think I fixed it. I I changed like the women games, workshop, part. 303 00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.980 huda: Oh, okay. 304 00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.475 Jenny Duan: Great 305 00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:45.000 Jenny Duan: Can you just do one more read through personally like, just read it through one more time, and I'm gonna read it through one more time, too, and see if you can identify any spots that still feel a bit sticky. 306 00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:14.799 huda: Oh, yeah, sorry to interrupt. But like one thing I was like worrying about, for, like the 1st draft as well is that like I mentioned like 7, like 3 times like by 7 pm. 7 figure income at 7 years old. And so I was wondering if, like that might like make the reader think that, like 7 is significant, and in the essay. 307 00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.570 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, maybe it's 308 00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.270 Jenny Duan: so. 309 00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.569 Jenny Duan: 8 pm. 310 00:40:28.7",
    "10 --> 00:40:32.170 Jenny Duan: I think this is fine. 2 instances of the word sevens. 311 00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.920 huda: Yeah, I think that's funny as well. 312 00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:41.980 huda: Okay. And then I think, like the last step with this, if, like, we could finalize this 313 00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.890 huda: maybe like like which prompt matches it the best. 314 00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:53.380 Jenny Duan: Let's do that right now. What are the like? Possible prompts? Do you have them up right now? 315 00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.279 huda: Oh, yeah, let me. 316 00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.370 huda: I'll put them in the zoom chat. 317 00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.600 huda: Oh, interesting. 318 00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.419 huda: and let's see. 319 00:44:41.950 --> 00:45:10.564 huda: Yeah, I'm just realizing, like the topic of this essay. I think we like brainstormed a really similar idea like a while back, for I think I had like an English assignment for like college. Or let me see, it was like the common assignment, and it was like pretty much the same about like challenging how like we can learn and then I challenge. And those, it's like a little different, because I talk more about like how like video games can be like educational. But 320 00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.469 huda: It was like like the same premise. I think. 321 00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.820 Jenny Duan: I think maybe, can you describe a topic idea or concept. 322 00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.430 huda: Oh, yeah, I think 323 00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.372 huda: I yeah, I think that one's 324 00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.779 huda: got the most thing. 325 00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.580 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 326 00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.709 Jenny Duan: yeah, I feel like that's a good fit. 327 00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.830 Jenny Duan: Yay. 328 00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.082 huda: Oh, my gosh!

Supplementals. 340 00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:25.559 Jenny Duan: Yeah, do you have a link to that. 341 00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.790 huda: Hmm. 342 00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.189 huda: should I share it to your personal account as well. 343 00:46:35.138 --> 00:46:38.249 Jenny Duan: I think my Iv mentors is working today. 344 00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:52.520 huda: Oh, yeah, the 1st one was the the Dumbledore essay, which, like, I guess we can like change that. 345 00:46:52.740 --> 00:47:00.330 huda: And then this one I did like. I use the Stanford essay for like the like the curiosity essay. 346 00:47:00.892 --> 00:47:02.069 huda: But I think 347 00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:08.009 huda: I'm not sure if, like I'm supposed to approach it this way. But I also like mentioned a couple of things specific to Unc 348 00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.179 huda: and like 349 00:47:09.625 --> 00:47:14.679 huda: kind of like weaving in like things that are unique about you and seeing like. Why. 350 00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.640 huda: like my curiosity can be like, answered with Unc. 351 00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:21.443 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 352 00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.340 Jenny Duan: can you put the link in the chat?

    " 00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:46.540 Jenny Duan: Just 356 00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:24.189 Jenny Duan: okay. I feel like this is asking you to describe one of your personal qualities. And so I'm not exactly clear what personal quality you're showing here. 357 00:48:26.427 --> 00:48:30.092 huda: I guess I was trying to like highlight like 358 00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:38.710 huda: like adaptability, and like how like in different like audiences like, for example, and like Sunday school, and then like 359 00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.550 huda: like virtual places. 360 00:48:41.954 --> 00:48:53.499 huda: and then also like online to like promote business like my different like audiences. And like, I'm using different platforms like leverage that. But yeah, I can see like how 361 00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:57.089 huda: that might not be as like, well, like highlighted here. 362 00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:03.310 Jenny Duan: Now I feel like in this instance, the dumbledore analogy might feel a little bit distracting, because 363 00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:06.610 Jenny Duan: it's yeah. It can be a little bit hard to tell, like, what 364 00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:12.800 Jenny Duan: exactly, is your personal quality here? Beyond, like this whole dumbledore story. 365 00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:14.810 huda: Yeah, I agree. 366 00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.839 Jenny Duan: So maybe we can just unwrap it from the dumbledore like, I feel like this. 367 00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.209 Jenny Duan: like essay is good. If we just 368 00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.909 Jenny Duan: maybe take out the Dumblator aspect. 369 00:49:33.494 --> 00:49:36.010 Jenny Duan: Is there another way? You can start this. 370 00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.120 Jenny Duan: This is great. Yeah, like, this is good. 371 00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.260 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 372 00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.869 Jenny Duan: change this question to a different question. 373 00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:10.149 huda: Maybe like I could like, do like some repetition. And so lik",
    "e after each time, like, I'm like deciding like, how do I approach this, I could be like, what's my plan of action? And then I can like like 374 00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.360 huda: like. 375 00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:18.220 huda: there's no AI ethics education. What's my plan of action, and then I could be like. 376 00:50:18.769 --> 00:50:28.649 huda: lack of groceries and restaurants turn my community into small business trove. What's my plan of action? And then maybe it could be repetition. But I don't know if that's 377 00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:31.710 huda: like, if that's really relevant. But. 378 00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:42.710 Jenny Duan: I feel like since are you? Are you highlighting your curiosity, your what if you could name one trait? What would you say? You're highlighting, or one to 3 traits. 379 00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.279 huda: I guess, like my adaptability. 380 00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.560 Jenny Duan: Okay. 381 00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.500 Jenny Duan: yeah. 382 00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.200 Jenny Duan: Then. 383 00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:55.510 Jenny Duan: yeah, I feel like the repetition could be effective. I'd like to see what it looks like. 384 00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:21.059 huda: Oh, this sentence could be like. 385 00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:31.110 huda: Can I drop like a statistic about like if AI ethics is like taught in 386 00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:32.810 huda: classrooms. 387 00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.333 Jenny Duan: Go for it. Yeah. 388 00:51:52.670 --> 00:52:04.080 huda: Hmm! Actually, I don't know if this will work, because, unlike the statistic, is saying that like 15% of Us. Colleges teach AI ethics. And then, like. 389 00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:12.610 huda: I don't know if, like a video game really like looks like it's being made for college students like, I don't know if, like, the person would understand that. 390 00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:25.149 Jenny Duan: Maybe maybe don't write about universities, because then it challenges like, okay, I don't know",
    " how robust 391 00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.619 Jenny Duan: Unc's ethics program is. So maybe like that wouldn't be good if they don't move forward. 392 00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.890 huda: Yeah. 393 00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:37.709 huda: I think we do have like AI ethics classes. But like I, I just, I also don't think it like 394 00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.700 huda: fits to us. 395 00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:41.050 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 396 00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.640 huda: You seem to find anything about like elementary schools. 397 00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.940 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 398 00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:40.600 huda: Maybe I could do something like 399 00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.380 huda: like. 400 00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.510 huda: just for example, like 3 and 4 401 00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:51.830 huda: children are exposed to AI every day, but they don't like. 402 00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:56.800 huda: but they don't understand like the ethics behind it, or something like that. 403 00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:06.960 Jenny Duan: Wait. I don't know if that is effective in this case, like I, I feel like it might be just distracting from your game. 404 00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:21.210 huda: I wanna like, like, I guess, kind of present like a problem. And then, like, I ask, what's my plan of action? And then I show how I solved it through like these different mediums. 405 00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:22.570 Jenny Duan: Right. 406 00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:29.930 huda: So like, the problem is that like AI, ethics isn't being taught and like, neither is 407 00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:34.359 huda: like. But just like data. Science are to younger people 408 00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:39.490 huda: like, even like lack of access to like tech education. 409 00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.160 huda: that's like 410 00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.889 huda: impacting like that's like the reason why I wanted to create synthoria. 411 00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:54.219 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think maybe you can. I don't know if you would ",
    "have to lead with it here, but maybe here 412 00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.080 Jenny Duan: would be a good place. 413 00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:02.900 Jenny Duan: because I feel like if you lead with it, it might distract the reader from like what you've done and like, I don't know if 414 00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.219 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm trying to think about the placement. But what are your thoughts. 415 00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:22.850 huda: Yeah, I I like, I think it'll definitely fit better there. But then I'll probably have to think. Then I think like maybe repetition might not be like or like. At least that question shouldn't be like my main question. That's being repeated. 416 00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.541 huda: because, like, I guess, I can see how like 417 00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.380 huda: like me tackling a problem isn't too evident in like 418 00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.580 huda: the other 2 paragraphs. 419 00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.300 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 420 00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.320 Jenny Duan: Oh. 421 00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:53.019 Jenny Duan: okay, maybe we can think about different transitions to these 2 sentences. First, st like, just to get rid of the double door analogy before we start remaking the rest of the lesson. 422 00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:54.180 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 423 00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:09.230 huda: okay, wait. 424 00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:38.100 huda: Hmm, yeah. I think this is where like repetition might be helpful. So it provides a good 425 00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:41.659 huda: easier transition between each of the paragraphs. 426 00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 427 00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.850 huda: Yeah, I just wanna I wanna figure out like, what 428 00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:51.049 huda: like, the question should be. 429 00:56:51.510 --> 00:57:04.190 huda: because I think that's like important and okay, so it could either be like, what's my plan of action? Which actually, it might be easier to like implement that into the folk",
    "lift paragraph, but not the centurial paragraph. 430 00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.909 huda: just because, like as you said, like, the the statistics might be distracting. 431 00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.210 huda: But, like the question could be 432 00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:23.230 huda: like, in other words, like just saying like, How do I adapt, or how do I? 433 00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:28.050 huda: How do I pivot? Maybe. 434 00:57:42.185 --> 00:57:51.390 Jenny Duan: okay, I think that the 1st thing we should just get I just want to get rid of all of these double door references, and I feel like your story is fine, if you just like. 435 00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:53.890 Jenny Duan: for all here is. 436 00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.479 Jenny Duan: and then from here to pivot. 437 00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:57.660 Jenny Duan: Hold on! 438 00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:01.620 Jenny Duan: I feel like this essay. Doubt 439 00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:07.620 Jenny Duan: is good, but it's not interesting now that we've gotten rid of all the double door stuff. So we need to find like a new 440 00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.560 Jenny Duan: way to make it interesting. 441 00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:48.469 huda: This might be too much of a stretch. But I could be like, yeah, actually, this is a lot of a stretch. But just like to say the idea. Like. 442 00:58:48.710 --> 00:59:13.343 huda: I guess I'm kind of like memory, and that, like everyone kind of like, has like a different okay, well, I feel like it has different implications. If I say I'm like a memory, it kind of sounds like I'm dead. But like, I think like. What I meant to say is that like different people have, like different perceptions of like memories, and then like 443 00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:19.839 huda: I guess by doing like these different like mediums, and like different ways of like 444 00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:23.939 huda: teaching and helping people. It's like. 445 00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:28.770 huda: I guess, like different perceptions. But I I don'",
    "t really like that analogy. 446 00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:37.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 447 00:59:54.630 --> 01:00:00.329 Jenny Duan: So they have 12 words. Well, so that means we probably need to cut some stuff as well. 448 01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:05.889 huda: I think I could definitely cut a lot from this in Thoria. Paragraph. 449 01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:42.489 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think you you're right. You need some explanation of this paragraph about why you built centuria. 450 01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.260 Jenny Duan: And then 451 01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.830 Jenny Duan: let's start with that and come back to this tomorrow. 452 01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.670 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 453 01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.670 huda: Yeah. 454 01:00:56.070 --> 01:01:09.780 huda: should I like start like, I feel like the best way to like, like, as I say, is like, start with a problem. And then like synthesize a solution. So maybe like, instead of like statistics, which might be like a little distracting like. 455 01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:12.740 huda: I could just like make a statement. Maybe. 456 01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:19.829 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, I agree. I feel like, like a blanket statement would be good. 457 01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:30.839 Jenny Duan: Okay, I have to go now because of another 9 30, but feel free to text me any questions, and we should reconvene tomorrow to talk about this essay 458 01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:33.440 Jenny Duan: again. I think we already have a meeting. 459 01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.376 Jenny Duan: No, I don't think we have a meeting set. 460 01:01:39.785 --> 01:01:45.099 Jenny Duan: I will text you about a meeting time, but I have to go now because I have a conflicting meeting. 461 01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:48.520 Jenny Duan: But yeah, I'll see you soon. Alright, bye! 462 01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:49.599 Jenny Duan: Congrats on your phone."
