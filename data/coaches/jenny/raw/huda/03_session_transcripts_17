Still not plugged in 5 00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.740 Jenny Duan: there we go. 6 00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.579 Jenny Duan: Okay? So it's been like a week since we've talked okay? 7 00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.390 Jenny Duan: So I think, let's just go right in. 8 00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.790 Jenny Duan: yeah, how's life? I heard about the SAT. We can put a bookmark in that come back to that. But how's life going in general for you? 9 00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:15.889 huda: Well, in terms of S sat. I'm a bit like disappointed in my score. But in other areas I think I'm progressing pretty well. 10 00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.530 huda: I think 11 00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:30.270 huda: we're having some issues like kind of getting traction for empowering AI like having people sign up and everything. We've gotten 3 sign up so far. But I think we need to circulate it more in like our groups. 12 00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.900 huda: But yeah, we've like, sent out, 13 00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.739 huda: like a Facebook post. And like, we've been like messaging. And like, we also have our website up. 14 00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.930 huda: And 15 00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.680 Jenny Duan: he sent me the link for the website. Maybe I can help you share it, too. 16 00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.360 huda: Yeah, okay. 17 00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.779 huda: it's just 18 00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.529 huda: wait 1 s. 19 00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.140 huda: Yeah, that's the website. 20 00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. 21 00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.920 Jenny Duan: That looks so good. 22 00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.990 huda: Thank you. 23 00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.700 Jenny Duan: But yeah, so what's what's been happening. So like you've been sharing. hey? 24 00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.620 Jenny Duan: And click in engaging. And you built this website, right? Or did the other person 25 00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.269 huda: yeah, with me? 26 00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.510 Jenny Duan: What? What I guess is happening right now with the 27 00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.140 Jenny Duan: with the project, like what has been the biggest people not signing up? And how how have you been trying to advertise it so far. 28 00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:18.759 huda: So so far, we've tried to put in all like so in our community, like been trying to put in all the Facebook posts. I think we have yet to kind of put it in our personal circles like, but 29 00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:29.009 huda: yeah, I think wouldn't try to like, get our neighbors and everything to sign up. But like we, we tried Facebook, and we had like 3 sign ups. But yeah. 30 00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.869 huda: we're trying to look for a lot more than that. So yeah. 31 00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.300 Jenny Duan: And how long have you been publicizing it for? 32 00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.570 huda: or like. 33 00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.839 huda: I guess, since Friday? Okay, so it's still, like, only been a couple of days. Right? Yeah. 34 00:05:47.420 --> 00:06:16.690 huda: Got it? And I'm wondering, just like, in terms of the advertising. Have you tried to do any other social media channels beyond Facebook, or has that been the main one that you're working on? Oh, yeah, we have our Instagram and then we start posting on there like we did an introductory post, with like details on like who we are, and then at the end, as like a QR code to like join. And then after that, I just like kind of made some random posts like like quotes from 35 00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:25.319 huda: like famous computer science people, and then saying, like, the caption was kind of explaining it. And then, yeah. 36 00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.429 Jenny Duan: maybe I can repost something for you. 37 00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:39.959 huda: Thanks. I saw you got sponsored by Jacob. That's really cool. Oh, yeah, thank you so much. That's been really exciting. 38 00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:49.420 huda: Oh, yeah. And then also, I started posting like more frequently on my professional account. I posted actually, like 39 00:06:49.530 --> 00:07:05.860 huda: a couple posts like one, update 2 updates on my game, and then some random reels like guesses on their phone instead of coding. And that one got a few views like a thousand 300. I think that's a lot. 40 00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.449 huda: Yeah, I was pretty excited about that. 41 00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.359 huda: Okay? And then this is the Instagram. 42 00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.689 huda: You should put your website in the Bio. Yeah, I think, Anita. 43 00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.480 huda: yeah. 44 00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.970 Jenny Duan: I think it'd be nice if you put some quotes from like female AI people. 45 00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.149 huda: yeah, I think. yeah, let me just update our buy real quick. 46 00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.850 Jenny Duan: Well, looks good. You have 9 followers. So far it's like the lot 47 00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.329 huda: wants to follow it. 48 00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.150 Jenny Duan: Good. And when did you launch it? 49 00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:18.650 huda: Well, we started the account I guess, a while ago. But then we started posting like. 50 00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.749 huda: I think our first post was on Saturday. Yeah. 51 00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.370 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's only been 2 days. What's your professional Instagram account. 52 00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.330 Jenny Duan: Com.

But I guess it's that. 62 00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.770 Jenny Duan: Look other people 63 00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:23.720 Jenny Duan: you should create. Okay, keep on doing stuff like this like this is really good, like, you already have 17 followers, and you don't follow anyone. Right. So it's like people were organically following you. 64 00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:41.440 huda: Thank you. And then on my tiktok so for homecoming. I was there part of like the filming crew. And we're basically doing like fit checks on everyone. So I kind of recorded the process like like my camera equipment and stuff. And that one got 65 00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.470 huda: 650 views. So yeah. 66 00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.210 Jenny Duan: nice. So it looks like social media is 67 00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.509 Jenny Duan: is doing well for you. It's going well for you. 68 00:09:51.660 --> 00:10:02.220 Jenny Duan: but this is exactly, I think, the right thing to do to like gain recognition for your game 69 00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.820 huda: yeah and then I kind of detailed like 8, 11 license. This one. 70 00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.020 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is super cool. Are you taking inspiration from any accounts? Or is this like all just coming from you? 71 00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:31.159 huda: There's actually a girl at my school. She has, like a podcast I kind of wanted to like. She doesn't really have summer content. But like I like her feed. And then also, like, is it a public? Is it like a professional account, or I think it's called the lazy gal, or something like that? 72 00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.520 huda: Yeah, that's right. 73 00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.040 Look 74 00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.360 Jenny Duan: cool. 75 00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:45.729 Jenny Duan: Wait. This is a nice feed, too. Yeah, yeah, she's really nice. She's like a year older than me. 76 00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.069 huda: do you have like a podcast 77 00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.169 huda: I think it's really cool. Well, so 78 00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:59.590 Jenny Duan: this is really cool, you should definitely like definitely do stuff like this like 79 00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.190 Jenny Duan: with the cute feed. And let's look at every account. 80 00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.589 Jenny Duan: although, to be honest, you can, doesn't really matter. It's more just like putting your ideas out there. This one has a lot of so. 81 00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.620 Jenny Duan: But this is really cute. Look at this. 82 00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.320 Jenny Duan: That's cute. 83 00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:29.949 Jenny Duan: Okay, so I'm glad to hear that's going. Well, I feel like sharing more of your empowering a I like on the professional Instagram, and then like trying to boost that through, there will also be a good way to get engagement. The other thing you can do is plug in. Do you know what next door is? 84 00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.169 huda: Oh, yeah, yeah. 85 00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:51.230 huda: If you can put an advertisement on next door, or like print posters, put them in your school, put them in the library stuff like that. That might be nice, too. Yeah, we also, we extended like the age group to ninth grade. Cause I feel like it's kinda easier to access ninth graders given like we're in high school. So 86 00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.409 Jenny Duan: were you able to have you been able to reach freshman at your school? 87 00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:06.519 huda: not yet. But I think I think we're going to send out. We're going to try to send out the email throughout the district. See if we could get like a lot of sign ups from that. 88 00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And how are you gonna do that? 89 00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:22.150 huda: So we have to contact our, I think the vice principal. And then she'll basically just send out the email like, we'll have to write the email, and then we have to send it to her, and then she can 90 00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.549 huda: spread it. 91 00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.290 Jenny Duan: Did she already say that she would be able to do that like. Have you talked to her about it? 92 00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:33.490 huda: I haven't. But my, I think my Co. Founder has er I mean, not Co. Founder, but Vice President. 93 00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.570 Jenny Duan: And who is the person you talk to? 94 00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.189 huda: Like the Vice president of the school, or the vice principal of the school. 95 00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.440 Jenny Duan: Okay? 96 00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.630 Jenny Duan: And how are you? Planning to reach the middle school audience? 97 00:12:51.980 --> 00:13:08.490 huda: So like the email that she sent out it'll like, go to the entire like district. So basically here, elementary schools and middle schools are combined. So like we'd be able to kinda access like middle schoolers and like freshmen at the same time 98 00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.390 Jenny Duan: got it. Okay. 99 00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:26.159 Jenny Duan: and how has your actual like lectures been going like, how have the slideshow been coming along? And like that. Prep in and of itself. 100 00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:31.730 huda: Yeah. So we were able to finish like, 3 lessons. 101 00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.169 huda: yeah, we just need one more kind of like detailing AI ethics. Yeah. 102 00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:52.030 Jenny Duan: Do you want me to add you to the? This may be good if you publish it. To do you know what in code justice is? 103 00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.150 huda: No. 104 00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.490 Jenny Duan: okay. And it's my friend's name. How runs it? 105 00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.469 I bet they have local varied chapters that you can also share it with. 106 00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.880 Jenny Duan: Okay, their website's being a little slow. 107 00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.049 Jenny Duan: Yeah, they have like workshops. 108 00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.389 Jenny Duan: let's see. 109 00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.310 Jenny Duan: encode justice. I don't know if encodes has a bay area. 110 00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.160 Jenny Duan: and 111 00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:59.680 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is a good organization to get you involved in, though let me just add you really quickly to their slack. I think that should be fine. 112 00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.770 Jenny Duan: what is your okay? Never mind. 113 00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:14.650 Jenny Duan: It's Huda Saraj. But the Raj is a 4 right@gmail.com. 114 00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.220 Okay. 115 00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.370 Jenny Duan: I'm just going to invite you to the slack. 116 00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.529 Jenny Duan: And then, 117 00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.740 Jenny Duan: okay, can you check your email to see if you've received that? 118 00:15:28.840 --> 00:16:02.610 huda: okay, yeah, I got an invite. Yeah. 119 00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:12.780 Jenny Duan: then another thing that you can do is maybe reach out to other like tech for change. So some organizations in the around the Bay area and then try to reach out to them, too. 120 00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.349 Jenny Duan: You can also publish it on. Do you remember Hatclub? Like signing up for a hat club? Their slack. 121 00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:26.010 huda: Yeah, also publish it. There. Is it going to be a virtual conference or like a virtual lesson, or in person? Have you decided 100? 122 00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:42.620 huda: We were gonna do in person. But I think virtual like it must be like easier to kind of access more people. I feel like cause in person. I don't think many people really have that like commitment. So 123 00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.990 huda: I think I think we might do it online. Yeah. 124 00:16:47.580 --> 00:17:02.390 Jenny Duan: maybe you can do the invite form and say like, do you have a preference in person in Mount Hen House, or Virtual? And then just have that as an option. And then from the number of sign ups you can get. If people are selecting more of the virtual option, then maybe you can just offer it virtually 125 00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.959 huda: Okay, what do you think about that idea? 126 00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:21.599 huda: Originally, I was actually gonna do like in person and then we'd have like kind of at the same time we'd have like cameras and stuff. So that and then like have that on zoom. So it's kind of both like people that are not in Mountain House they'd be able to join still. But 127 00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.809 Jenny Duan: that's a good idea, too. Have you? Do you? Does your library have the type of camera setup that you can use. 128 00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.290 huda: No, but I could probably bring my own camera. 129 00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.789 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds like a good idea, too. Let me. Just 130 00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:56.620 Jenny Duan: so. I think the the places that you can try to reach are in code, justice network hat club next door, which is more like community based. But next door is a good platform, and then, obviously, the schools as well. Are there any other organizations that you plan to reach out to? 131 00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:13.060 huda: so I don't know, cause II was kind of thinking that this would be more local. I wasn't sure that I'd be able to share it with like other outside organizations cause I thought it'd be only in Mount House. But 132 00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.699 huda: what about the virtual option then 133 00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:23.769 Jenny Duan: like if people were not in Mount House? Would you think they'd be able to join virtually, or would you not want them to like? Only keep it to Mount House people? 134 00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:31.879 huda: I think it's better if, like, more people join, I guess because we'd have like a higher impact on like more people. 135 00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:44.239 Jenny Duan: Right? So I guess with that, do you wanna keep offering it to like. Do you want to revise your invite, or what do you? What do you and your like vice president think? 136 00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:55.569 huda: I can talk to her, but I think what I'm thinking is like we'll probably extend it to not just Mount House, and maybe 137 00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:03.329 huda: like. I don't know if in person we should even offer in person. Because honestly, I feel like 138 00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:14.450 huda: it'll be kinda odd, because only like a few people will show up to the in person. And then, if we're getting most of our people from like out of Mountain House, then And I think it'll just be better if we just do fully online. 139 00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.860 Jenny Duan: got it? Maybe you could do like a 140 00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:25.189 Jenny Duan: yeah, maybe wait one more week and then see how many in person sign ups you can get first. 141 00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.249 Jenny Duan: and then after that, like, if you can't get in person, sign up, send you online. Cause. Have you already had to book the 142 00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.440 Jenny Duan: the library conference room? Or has that already been booked? 143 00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:46.669 huda: We are waiting for to see, like how many people are interested. Cause there's like like a fee. So like we just want to make sure that, like everyone's interested. 144 00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:57.150 Jenny Duan: be honest.

My games in thorium is a change I want to see in the world infusing education, value and knowledge within. 304 00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:14.950 Jenny Duan: yeah, within. 305 00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.450 Jenny Duan: But then 306 00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.119 Jenny Duan: the future of digital games 307 00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:29.729 Jenny Duan: cause, he already said, like enjoyably here. So you think that's already highlight it. 308 00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:34.099 Jenny Duan: and 244 words that feels perfect to me. 309 00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:40.230 Jenny Duan: Okay, let's read over one more time. Can you read this in your voice? And I just want to hear it, but it sounds like in your voice. 310 00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:48.899 huda: In seventh grade debating class. I distinctly remember one controversial conversation, whether video games were detrimental to society. 311 00:40:49.000 --> 00:41:10.399 huda: Prompted to argue that they were, I initially did not understand. Since I spent most of my days on Roblox, dreaming of new communities, structures, and worlds. Gaming provided a form of escapism and comfort to me, a respite from the loneliness and isolations I sometimes experienced within. The male dominated CS. Classes at school. 312 00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:23.329 huda: Through my research process I discovered that video games had an immense effect on their player's mental health. Over 89% of gamers are diagnosed with depression, and many reflect this behavior with violence. 313 00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:36.270 huda: What's especially disheartening is that some video games encourage this behaviour. The top 3 video games in the world include fortnite valor and CS. Go, all aggressive first person, shooter, game, glorifying gun violence. 314 00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:59.980 huda: This is far from the world, I imagine, a world, where, instead of these games games that teach their audience are at the top of the charts. Sunna Salam, a 12 year old, citizen of Cythoria, learns about a I in a thrilling journey, with no initial knowledge of a I or machine learning. Sonna transforms through a series of many educational experiences with her sister. 315 00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:15.020 huda: just like such. I want my game to impact young minds who don't have the opportunity to learn about complex topics enjoyably. My games and Thoria is a change. I want to see in the world infusing education, value, and knowledge within the future of digital games. 316 00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:22.519 Jenny Duan: Okay, how do you feel about how it reads, are there any points that you feel like? Don't sound natural, or maybe don't sound clear to you. 317 00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:28.280 huda: I feel like this sentence was a bit kind of weird 318 00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:38.690 huda: like this is not in the world, I imagine, a world where, instead of these games I guess, games that teach their audience 319 00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:51.749 Jenny Duan: educational games? Or what did you mean by this? Or did I write that? I'm not sure. 320 00:42:51.880 --> 00:43:01.089 huda: or yeah, either that. Or we can do games that teach their audiences. Crucial life skills, maybe, or complex topics 321 00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.040 Jenny Duan: make accessible 322 00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.750 Jenny Duan: complex complex 323 00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.419 Jenny Duan: that make complex topics accessible? 324 00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:16.340 huda: Yeah. 325 00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.750 Jenny Duan: like that. 326 00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:20.920 huda: Yeah, that sounds a lot better. 327 00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.900 Jenny Duan: What about the rest of the essay? How do you feel? 328 00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:39.280 huda: I think it sounds good. Is there like any way I should like use more inventory throughout 329 00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.740 Jenny Duan: or before. 330 00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.989 Jenny Duan: I'm sorry this was a bit what would the imagery be for? 331 00:43:51.850 --> 00:44:00.840 huda: That's just kinda wondering, like, maybe in my seventh I could describe my seventh grade, debate class, and like how was really confused at that time? 332 00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:05.220 huda: Like? Is it necessary to have imagery? 333 00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:13.659 Jenny Duan: No, not necessarily. If you feel like to add something but like, let's think about the point of writing imagery right? It's just to make people 334 00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:24.339 Jenny Duan: empathise or like better understand your situation, but if you're able to do that clearly, it's not always necessary, because it does take up more word, Count, and since you're already pretty close 335 00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:33.229 Jenny Duan: on the word count limit. I don't think it's necessary, but if you want to, obviously you can have the opportunity to. What do you think? 336 00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:35.879 huda: I think this is fine, then 337 00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.410 Jenny Duan: sounds good. 338 00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.270 Jenny Duan: awesome. Cool. 339 00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:47.829 Jenny Duan: Okay. Is this the last essay? I think we have gone over your other ones. But do you feel comfortable with the rest of your essays? 340 00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:54.979 huda: Yeah, I feel comfortable with the rest. And then I also gathered some like examples that I can share 341 00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.420 huda: I didn't record my 342 00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.550 huda: game, demo. But 343 00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.370 huda: maybe I can do that like right after this call. 344 00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.920 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Where are the examples like, where did you put those 345 00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.770 huda: right under the 1013, one 346 00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:18.520 huda: October thirteenth. right here. Oh, cool. Yeah. 347 00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:22.310 Jenny Duan: And this looks good. I mean, she drops. 348 00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.209 Jenny Duan: Yep, this is good. 349 00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:40.059 Jenny Duan: This is really good. I haven't seen. This is how to change between scenes using a Collider and unity tube. So this is my games. And, Thoria, it's like an AI super cool. I love the music. 350 00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.920 Jenny Duan: Bigma and nice nice. Do you have a personal website? By the way. 351 00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.839 huda: not yet should make one hudasaraj.com. 352 00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:52.619 Jenny Duan: But like, that'd be really cool. 353 00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:58.119 Jenny Duan: Yeah, you can put all your projects. It's it'd be like your digital resume, you know, like, with all your projects there. 354 00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.629 huda: that'd be cool. 355 00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.300 Jenny Duan: Okay. 356 00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:07.260 Jenny Duan: So I think that after today, then you should just submit it like. 357 00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:22.120 Jenny Duan: film your video. And then, if there's any more links that you can think of, do you have any other websites that you can link? I remember last time there was one website that the link wasn't exactly working. But do you know, if we'd be able to get that to work, or what's the status on that specific website. You know what I'm talking about. 358 00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:35.140 huda: Yeah, I don't think that one's working. I think I can try just like deploying it from github directly. But yeah, I wasn't working last time I checked on Netlifi. So 359 00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.769 huda: yeah. 360 00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:39.060 huda: yeah. 361 00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:47.850 Hello. 362 00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:50.109 Right? Cool. 363 00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:57.259 Jenny Duan: So yeah. I think that one from Github. Hi, sir, how's it going? 364 00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:58.530 Jenny Duan: Good. 365 00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:08.959 Jenny Duan: Awesome. We're just talking about submitting her and cwit application. We just finished polishing her last essay. So yeah. 366 00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:17.020 huda: working month for this one, I think, 367 00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.600 huda: okay. 368 00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.309 huda: yeah, it works on this one. 369 00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:50.090 Jenny Duan: So then I think you can also link that one too. And then as many links as possible, I think, will be good, because part of the way that they evaluate you is just based on your commitment to computer science. So as long as you're able to show that you have a lot of existing computer science interests, you have that background. That'll be really cool. 370 00:47:50.280 --> 00:48:01.939 Jenny Duan: So I think that right now all of your essays, because we've talked about the most recent one, and then the rest of the ones that we covered last time should be good to submit. So once you film your screen cap or your screen recording up 371 00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:08.860 Jenny Duan: the game, then you should be feeling confident to submit. Do you have your teacher recommendations and everything else in place? 372 00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.059 huda: Do we need teacher recommendations for this information? 373 00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:26.059 Jenny Duan: in the past they have. But actually, I don't think they do this yearly. Would you be able to check really quickly? Yeah, I'm gonna open it. I 374 00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.449 Jenny Duan: I don't necessarily think so. 375 00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:33.249 Jenny Duan: I don't think they do this year, but I think in the past they may have 376 00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.070 Jenny Duan: let me also check. 377 00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.999 huda: Yeah, we don't need a teacher recommendation. 378 00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:04.560 Jenny Duan: Then you should be good to submit. Just after this call, once you film your screen cap. how awesome. 379 00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:10.569 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then the other thing is, how is film called going. And what's your plan for making progress with that? 380 00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:32.129 huda: Yeah. So we actually started writing our script. This weekend we had like a officer's meeting. And we basically synthesize like our first idea, I think already told you. But it was like, basically a parody of breaking bad where this time we kind of like specified like the details like we hashed out like it's gonna be about like 381 00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:51.610 huda: he needs like a hair transplant. So he starts writing people's essays at school, and then and then, like his principal, starts like like suspecting him. And then he asked for like a cut, and his money also exposed him. And yeah, it's kinda like so much the actual plot. But yeah. 382 00:49:51.680 --> 00:50:04.960 huda: and then we're having a meeting next Monday to kinda get our actors like assigned and everything. But we're meeting with pre-production on Thursday. 383 00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:17.089 Jenny Duan: Awesome sounds good. And then the other thing I wanted to check in with you was about the Congressional App challenge. Is this still something that you are working on, or planning to do with your VP. For empowering a I 384 00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:28.410 huda: I wanna continue it. But honestly. I'm wondering like cause she doesn't really know how to code, but she still wants to do it with me and like 385 00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:39.980 huda: I kinda wanna like apply by myself, cause she's not really doing anything. And I might just like code it by myself and like try to apply. But 386 00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:52.160 huda: I guess it's good to keep a good relationship, since she is like my partner for one of my nonprofits. but yeah, that's what I'm kinda concerned about. But yeah, I think we like 387 00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:59.390 huda: haven't made much progress on that, honestly. But we should. We're going to try focusing on remorse as the due date is coming up. 388 00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like you should definitely just do that by yourself. 389 00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:18.520 Jenny Duan: Because I think having a partner who doesn't encode will probably slow you down. So, if you like, maybe just maintain your relationship with her. But just like find a way to tell her that you like. Want to do it yourself, you know, or just don't bring it up to her. She doesn't ask about it. 390 00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:33.189 Jenny Duan: Okay, now that we've submitted this, or we're planning to submit this Aic award. I think it'd be valuable to think about transitioning our focus to preparing your summer as like this Junior Year Senior Year. Summer is very important. 391 00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:50.899 Jenny Duan: So one thing I wanna bring into your attention something that just opened is the leadership seminars program with Notre Dame. And this is a pretty cool program, because it's only 10 days long. So you could obviously do other things when you're doing this in the summer, too. But it's a free program at Notre Dame. They have, like different 392 00:51:50.990 --> 00:52:03.080 Jenny Duan: topic. So, for example, business, what is it good for global issues? Inequality in America, the environment, the power of investing. And I've did this program when it was online. But usually they go in person. So 393 00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:11.459 Jenny Duan: because to go spend 10 days on campus, meet other like intelligent people who are doing the program and learn about the topic of your choice. So 394 00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:15.429 Jenny Duan: I'm wondering if this is something that you'd be interested in. And 395 00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:18.169 Jenny Duan: yeah, if you'd like to apply. 396 00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.510 huda: Yeah, I know what you're saying. 397 00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.230 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. 398 00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:40.190 Jenny Duan: So yeah, it's a free program, which means it's super competitive, which means it also like sort of functions as an award on your application. So I think that that'd be really valuable to you. So after we finish wrapping up and submitting the Nc wit one, we'll turn our focus to doing this and also starting to look at the other summer programs that are, you know, 399 00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.890 Jenny Duan: opening up applications. This cycle? 400 00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:56.060 Jenny Duan: Cool. So with our last 8 min, I want to talk about really debriefing your sat, how you felt there. And maybe if we can make like a plan for I think you're signed up for November. Right? 401 00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:01.950 Jenny Duan: okay. So I just love to hear about like how that experience went for you, and like 402 00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:09.340 Jenny Duan: you said, felt easy, but then it maybe was harder than imagined, so I'd love to hear your perspective on how that went for you. 403 00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.829 huda: I think 404 00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:37.620 huda: what kind of went wrong was a math section cause. I had a 700 on reading and writing, and then a 6, 20 on math, and I'm not sure I got that low like I knew I'd get a lower score. For that one cause it was definitely harder than the reading section. I did feel like, kind of like the no calculator question. They had some questions that 405 00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:50.190 huda: where on any of my practice test like I think there was one where there's like circles inside of a square, and then you're given like the radius and then I think you have to find, like the perimeter of the square, or something like that. 406 00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:54.560 huda: That was something that was confusing, and also like 407 00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.629 huda: for some of the questions. Like, I think there was one 408 00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.560 huda: like 409 00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:10.959 huda: I guess I can't really explain it, but it was like one of those kinda inequality questions. And that really tripped me up. 410 00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:28.559 huda: And I thought, Okay, I thought it would be a little better than I actually did. And I went to the cross cross test like examination thing and it said that my heart of algebra is like the lowest. I think it said 411 00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:33.209 huda: so. That's something that I need to focus on 412 00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.099 huda: And I think just like 413 00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:41.829 huda: studying. I need to like kind of focus more on my math. I think I can share, like 414 00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.760 huda: where I kind of messed up. 415 00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:50.380 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that'd be great. I don't think I can log in. So that might be something that you have to like. 416 00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:57.059 Jenny Duan: screen, share, or like. Take screenshots of, because I don't have access to your account. Obviously. 417 00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:03.130 huda: I'll just share like cause it doesn't give you like what questions you got wrong. But I'll show you like 418 00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:09.090 huda: it shows you like what like topics you kinda got wrong on 419 00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:19.659 huda: So you said that this one felt easier than your your previous exams. 420 00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:24.849 Jenny Duan: Do you still feel that way after getting your score back? Or do you think that 421 00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:33.500 Jenny Duan: like, do you think that it was an issue with the curb? Or do you think that like what made you feel, I guess, more confident after taking this one compared to the ones in the past. 422 00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:58.589 huda: I feel like the beginning. Questions were definitely like a lot like really easy, like they're asking like really simple questions in the beginning. Obviously, I think, like the bubble in questions were like a lot more tough than than like the first few questions for each of the math sections. So I think the beginning part kind of like boosted my confidence. 423 00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:05.859 huda: and I guess that's why I kinda thought it was going. Better. Let me just. I'll share my screen for 424 00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:20.509 Ivy Mentors: and Jenny, just for my understanding, I mean, do these exams like. are they pretty much like same comp like, I mean, II think that it should be normalized in some ways, right? Like the complexity and the 425 00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:26.249 Ivy Mentors: how hard it is. But of course, there's always gonna be like a deviant factor. Right? 426 00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, mostly not the same. 427 00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:31.719 Jenny Duan: Some of them kind of have 428 00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:45.610 Jenny Duan: like a curve. So if the questions are harder, usually the curve will be better. So like you'll get more points, even if you like, missed questions. But if it just is easier than the curve might be harsher. So like you might get a lower 429 00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:49.689 Jenny Duan: score, even if you've missed the same amount of questions. So that's only different. 430 00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:56.359 Ivy Mentors: Interesting. I'm also trying to understand this. 431 00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:05.429 huda: Yeah, I think also, I was struggling with like there was a few triangle questions. And I think I need to focus more on that one studying as well. 432 00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:09.599 huda: have you tried downloading your score report. 433 00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.810 huda: me try. Now. 434 00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:19.579 Jenny Duan: I think if you go to test questions you might be able to see what you got wrong. Also. 435 00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:26.770 huda: I think you have to purchase it now. Which fine you you can purchase these things? I said, these are important, right? 436 00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.059 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think I purchased mine, and I think it was helpful for me 437 00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.660 Jenny Duan: when I took it. 438 00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.099 Ivy Mentors: Wow! This is a good report. Hmm, interesting. 439 00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:55.899 Jenny Duan: Okay? So it looks like your history and social sciences is really good. yeah, it looks like the heart of algebra 440 00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:58.040 huda: is the lowest. 441 00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:00.109 Jenny Duan: Can you scroll down to the rest? 442 00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.750 Jenny Duan: Okay. 443 00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:12.229 huda: so you're registered for the November, SAT. Right? Yes. 444 00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:20.080 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! How do you feel about taking it in November? I'll tell you my recommendation, but I'd love to know like what you feel first. 445 00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:26.809 huda: I think I have like like my school work isn't too 446 00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:36.940 huda: like hard right now, so I think I'll have like a lot of time to, you know, like focus on the sat. And I kinda wanna prioritize the SAT. The most this week. 447 00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.880 huda: Like these next 2 weeks, and I think. 448 00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:57.139 huda: given like. Now that I know, like how the experience of actually taking a test is, I think, I'll be able to test myself on like the practices in really similar conditions. And kind of like note, which type of questions I kind of need to work on more. 449 00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.600 You feel like you weren't taking the practice test in testing conditions. 450 00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.110 huda: Ii feel like 451 00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:19.360 huda: the the breaks. I think we're definitely different cause. I took longer than 5 min break so maybe that could be like one of the differences. But I mean, like obviously timing was the same but 452 00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.989 huda: oh, yeah. And then, also, like, in our actual testing, we have like, really quick breaks, like 5 min. 453 00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.820 huda: We didn't have any. 10 min breaks. So I was. 454 00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:37.710 huda: I thought we had a 10 min break in the sat. But yeah, they gave us like like 2, 5 min breaks 455 00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.269 Jenny Duan: in between which sections 456 00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:44.490 huda: in between reading and writing, and then I think. 457 00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:48.330 huda: writing and math. 458 00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:50.620 huda: the first math section. 459 00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:54.360 Jenny Duan: That's interesting. That usually is not how it goes. But 460 00:59:54.970 --> 01:00:16.709 huda: do you feel like that made a big difference that 5 min like you're between the reading writing and the math section. Yeah, I think II think like if I had more time like I'd have been able to kind of like kinda calm down and kinda like, get ready for the next section, you know, cause they like barely gave us time to go to the bathroom, and then the girls bathroom was like locked in. 461 01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:24.719 huda: I don't know. I just feel like they could have handled it better, maybe. But II think it's on me. I could have like focused better. But yeah. 462 01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:29.270 Jenny Duan: that makes sense. Do you feel like it was more of a mental issue. Do you feel like it was a knowledge issue? 463 01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.749 Jenny Duan: Did it have to do with your perspective and confidence? Or was it that you didn't know how to do things? 464 01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:44.510 huda: I think it must have been confidence because I felt pretty good after eating it. But like, I don't know clearly by the scores. I don't think 465 01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:49.010 huda: my like confidence in the questions. I don't think they were correct. Yeah. 466 01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:57.579 Ivy Mentors: yeah, because I was there with her. Right? Like. So for me, also, it was a bit surprising, because, you know, II also gave you like a real time kind of excitement, because 467 01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:08.120 Ivy Mentors: it's always you know, kind of top of mind like she comes out. And she had a very she was quite confident. So what I'm really concerned about is more like, you know, 468 01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:14.540 Ivy Mentors: is, is Huda able to really kind of evaluate or self assess herself? You know, when she's scoring her practice test. 469 01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:26.519 Ivy Mentors: Is that automated? Or is that something she manually does? Because I don't have details on that. So I'm just trying to understand where the the gaps are also like from a feedback loop perspective. And she's practicing right? 470 01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.739 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe one thing we can test Huda is 471 01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:37.600 huda: Oh, I think you cut out. 472 01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:56.360 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think she'll probably might be joining. 473 01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.020 Ivy Mentors: So oh, I didn't know. This is a good 474 01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:26.480 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. I think that maybe one thing we can try is when you take your practice. Maybe you can take it in a different room. So not in your bedroom we try to find like a blank, like a study room, maybe in your house, and then have someone else time you so have like a parent sibling 475 01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:33.330 Jenny Duan: siri, like a Amazon home. Something else time you. And then when you're taking it try to 476 01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:52.109 Jenny Duan: like, take it under the testing circumstances like. So only give yourself a 5 min break, and then at the end, before you score it. One exercise that you can try is trying to guess your score, or try to guess how many questions you get wrong, and then score it, and then see how much your prediction goes with the score, and that will give you a better way to evaluate 477 01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.100 Jenny Duan: and but I think, that 478 01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:06.420 Jenny Duan: okay, so you know that after december, the test is going to shift to virtual right? 479 01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:09.210 Jenny Duan: And so because of that, 480 01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.780 huda: I think you're set on taking the paper test. Right? Yeah. 481 01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.589 Jenny Duan: Okay? Because of that, that means that you have the November test and the December test right 482 01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:24.240 Jenny Duan: left, and then there's always the act right. Have you ever taken the act? 483 01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.060 huda: I've taken a practice test. I got like a 29, I think. 484 01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.449 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you feel like the act is harder? The Sct. Or they're about the same for you. 485 01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:49.510 huda: I feel like a CT. Is kinda harder, just because, like the signs section is like really confusing for me. And maybe I need to practice. But like I just feel like it's a lot more like difficult than the signs passages in the SAT. 486 01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:51.790 Jenny Duan: Okay, 487 01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:58.350 huda: how much time do you have to dedicate to your city. I think that 2 weeks. So November ninth at first. Right? Yeah. 488 01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:02.189 Jenny Duan: Think November fourth, November fourth. 489 01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.480 Jenny Duan: I think 2 weeks is too short to bring your score up. 490 01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:17.990 Jenny Duan: Think you shall wait until the December test, because I think you won't see a significant improvement in 2 weeks. In my opinion. I think that that's challenging. So I think that, you know, waiting until 491 01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:25.420 Jenny Duan: December might be a good idea for you, and then also, like as you continue to practice. Maybe. Do you do it with the bubble sheets? 492 01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:26.830 huda: Yeah. 493 01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:30.239 Jenny Duan: But will she have someone else grade it for you? 494 01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.100 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think we lost you, Jenny, again 495 01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:40.089 Jenny Duan: rest. And then I take it in December. 496 01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:51.300 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that you take tests too many times. That's also on your record, so that might not be the best idea. So I think, just don't stress. Wait till December. Take it, and then, if that doesn't go well, hopefully, it does. 497 01:04:51.890 --> 01:05:17.149 huda: If it doesn't go well, you can also try the act or go test optional. More and more schools are doing that, especially like the University of California schools. They don't even look at your test, regardless of whether or not you take them. So there's always like a you know, a solution. Is there a way to cancel the the sat test then? Because, we already like paid for it, and like booked in everything so like. 498 01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:23.620 huda: and we also pay like the late fees. So I'm not sure if that like if you'd be able to get a refund or anything. 499 01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:36.440 Ivy Mentors: Figure that out, I think. Yeah, that's a good concern. But I think I kind of tend to agree with you. Jenny, that was my feeling as well. I think the thought process that Houda had 500 01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:45.100 Ivy Mentors: was more like, Hey, it's kinda gonna be like a practice test, if not right? So. But II think to your point 501 01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.739 Ivy Mentors: number one like, you know, it goes on your record. 502 01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.900 Ivy Mentors: And you know 503 01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:59.260 Ivy Mentors: if if I mean, I think the downside is like, if that's one, it goes on the record. And second thing like, if if you don't get a good score, then actually, it's not good for morale, too. Right? 504 01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:07.900 Ivy Mentors: So I think that was my thinking as well. So I I'm actually also not I also don't recommend, like, you know, taking like back to back 505 01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.630 Ivy Mentors: might be a bit more like thinking and strategizing and practicing more will be helpful so that's my thought too, actually. 506 01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.360 Jenny Duan: yeah, and I'm wondering like. 507 01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:39.799 Jenny Duan: if you would be able to go to like an SAT prep. Service. Are you looking for like external tutors? Because I think that being able to have, like a guided prep like 3 times a week, would be beneficial. Because it is a pretty short timeframe like, even if you took in December, you still only have a month, maybe like a month and 2 weeks. So it is still a big crunch, even if you take it in December. 508 01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:46.340 huda: Yeah, we could probably find like a like a tutoring service for the SAT, yeah. 509 01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:57.360 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. So like, yeah, I mean, you know, actually, samia's Samia, like, you know my older daughter, I did send her like I did sign up her to like one of these services. 510 01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.879 Ivy Mentors: and you know they kind of give all this books, and you know, same strategies same like. They just kind of resell the same thing 511 01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:12.080 Ivy Mentors: I like. I was just wondering, like, you know, what? What is the real kind of benefit that these services offer, Jenny, I know that you also wear a sack tutor. You said you have actually. 512 01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.150 Jenny Duan: I would actually rather prefer like. If we can see a way where you can actually spend more time with Huda like that could be a good way 513 01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:25.789 Ivy Mentors: unless you feel like you might, you know, might might be. There's something that might be hard for you to kind of focus on with. Houda. 514 01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.270 Ivy Mentors: Let me know. Yeah. 515 01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.850 Jenny Duan: I feel like 516 01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.249 Jenny Duan: nicely to tutor is 517 01:07:35.370 --> 01:08:00.250 Jenny Duan: to just to get students to study, like I think, in my opinion, that's the most benefit is just to have a time where they can answer questions, work through examples, and just sit down with the student. Because I think, as a student like, it's very hard to make the time to like, actually study yourself. So, having someone to motivate you, I think, is what I see the main purpose of. An however, I don't think that's good as issue right now, because I feel like she's already 518 01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:12.569 Jenny Duan: is putting in the time to study. So that's why I'm like I don't know how much of a help I could be, because usually with my clients like that's their main issues like they don't study. So then I able to help them work through examples. But 519 01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:20.829 Jenny Duan: I think that if it's a knowledge gap, then that might be a little bit more like need, maybe more professional help 520 01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:34.729 Jenny Duan: But I'm not. I think that would have to see like if Huda, if you think your issue is a knowledge issue like a content issue, or if it's like a not understanding the test format or structure, or like practice timing type of issue. 521 01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:40.599 huda: Yeah, so I'd say, like. it's kind of like 522 01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:47.109 huda: some of the sentence, or like some of the questions. Structures are a bit confusing to me. 523 01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:48.310 huda: like. 524 01:08:48.880 --> 01:09:09.090 huda: yeah, there's like some specific ones that just I don't really understand but other than that, I think timing isn't that much of an issue for me, cause I do have like a lot of free time, which I think maybe cause I was trying to use that time to go back on my questions. But honestly, whenever I was checking all my questions. They were like, right? So 525 01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:14.199 huda: I don't know. I think it's probably like my work is incorrect or something like that. 526 01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:25.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that for me, what I found most useful when I was preparing for the SAT. Is because my issue was just like there were some topics I wasn't that familiar with. So I just 527 01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:32.689 Jenny Duan: bought like a test bank. I use U world. I don't know if I'd recommend this to everyone. This is just what I did 528 01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:34.960 Jenny Duan: But 529 01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:40.559 Jenny Duan: I did U world, which is just a online like test bank. 530 01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:43.949 Jenny Duan: And it gives like, sample SAT questions. And 531 01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:53.339 Jenny Duan: I just like bought like a 3 month subscription. I did all the questions in there, and that was what helped me. But again, I don't know if I would recommend that to everyone. 532 01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:55.639 Jenny Duan: I think that a good model, too, like 533 01:09:56.470 --> 01:10:00.440 huda: I've heard about like this web site. I think it's 1,600 a I/O 534 01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:09.380 huda: This one, I think, like I've heard about this one. 535 01:10:10.650 --> 01:10:23.980 Ivy Mentors: I I'm sure there are. Daima doesn't like kind of things. I think. What is more important, I feel like is first really finding what her week areas are, I think, and that Hooda can really help understand by like I think, based on what you've done. 536 01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:30.789 Ivy Mentors: I think to me that that's really important to really understand what the root causes. Where are the weak spots? And then working on that? 537 01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:42.099 Ivy Mentors: I don't necessarily think that access to questions or any type of platforms and services is actually a challenge, because I was just like every other day, that's a new platform for sat. And A/C. To be honest, right? 538 01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.540 Ivy Mentors: So 539 01:10:44.710 --> 01:11:02.600 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah, I think we do. I think what might be beneficial for you is to go through like a topic by topic breakdown of the sat specifically the math section, and then review all those concepts like one by one. And I think that Khan Academy is a great resource for that. 540 01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:26.219 Jenny Duan: I think that if you wanted to hire like an external tutor to walk you through that that's also possible, but not necessarily necessary, I think, but just having a breakdown of like a step by step. Topic guide on the sat would be really helpful, I think, and I think a lot of the sat is about applying existing concepts to different issues. For example, like the perimeter of a square. 541 01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:31.040 huda: You said that question was like a circle and a square right? And find the perimeter. Right? Yeah. 542 01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:36.070 Jenny Duan: So how would you approach that question if you were to answer it right now. 543 01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:55.829 huda: I wasn't sure, so I just I doubled the the radius to be the circle or the diameter, and then and then I set that as one of the sides, and then I multiply that by 4. 544 01:11:55.930 --> 01:12:01.580 huda: And that was my answer. That wasn't correct. Yeah, I don't think so. 545 01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:14.910 Jenny Duan: How do you know if that wasn't correct? If you can't see your answer score for so I feel like you should get your score report. Find out what you actually miss, and then from there find out what topics you struggle the most with, because 546 01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:23.809 Jenny Duan: it says that heart of algebra is your issue not necessarily like passport to advance math, which is what I think geometry would fall under. 547 01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:24.730 Jenny Duan: because 548 01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:29.579 Jenny Duan: I think algebra doesn't have to like. That's not an algebra question. That's a geometry question. 549 01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:33.189 huda: I think the algebra maybe like 550 01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:40.620 huda: like a number of solutions, those type of questions. That one. I was a bit. 551 01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:44.120 huda: I think that was one of the ones I was confused about. Yeah. 552 01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:48.569 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think I would recommend. Yeah, sorry. Go ahead, Jen. 553 01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:49.670 Jenny Duan: No, go ahead. 554 01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:51.249 Ivy Mentors: No, no, that's fine. So 555 01:12:51.340 --> 01:13:01.810 Ivy Mentors: I think. Yeah, II mean, II feel like, you know, conceptually, I think she should be strong. So I think, going and you know, maps is actually, I mean, I would say that 556 01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:11.490 Ivy Mentors: she needs to spend time and go through these concepts right? It's I don't think it's it's it's gonna be like, the information is just gonna be available. II don't think that's actually scarce. 557 01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:22.190 Ivy Mentors: So identifying where our gaps are, and and practicing those concepts. And then to your point applying comes only with practice. Right? If I'm not mistaken and might be, if she needs like extra sessions. You can help her. 558 01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.470 Ivy Mentors: My only challenge is this right? I have sent my older daughter to these stress prep places. 559 01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:34.650 Ivy Mentors: and all they do is they really package it so well? And they they give you all these booklets and pamphlets, and you know, some software tools. 560 01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:52.350 Ivy Mentors: But I think it's no different than, honestly speaking, like a tool online. Right? For example, right? II would rather just go with that unless there's someone who's actually spending time and sitting like, you know, one on one, and might be there are tutors in some platforms out there, right? Who actually are really specialized in in sat, for example, right? 561 01:13:52.680 --> 01:14:02.680 Jenny Duan: I think here's what we can do. Maybe we can do so normally, we have an hour and a half every week, right? So that's maybe we can do like 562 01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:06.970 Jenny Duan: 3 30 min sessions, or we can do like 563 01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:22.839 Jenny Duan: 1 h. We can dedicate 1 h to your normal check ins and then do like extra. I think you need 3 sessions a week for the sat like, I think, regardless of it's me or someone else. I think just 3 sessions a week is a baseline, because you only have one month to go, so 564 01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:26.379 Jenny Duan: it has to be like pretty regular check-ins. 565 01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:31.220 Jenny Duan: but I think that somehow we can incorporate, maybe like 566 01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:43.969 Jenny Duan: 3 sessions a week into helping you with your sat. I think that would be okay with me, too, just depending on, like, how much time you wanna spend on this per session. It could be like 30 min, or it could be like 1 h sessions. Kind of 567 01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:51.010 Jenny Duan: yeah, depending on how you're feeling. I think 30 min, maybe 3 sessions will be 30 min would be enough. 568 01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:58.149 Jenny Duan: Because again, like the majority of the work is just gonna be coming from repetitive practice, like 569 01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:23.599 Jenny Duan: having someone to sit with you or having an individual tutor is not gonna fix all your problems. It's more like you have to. The tutor is gonna help you like guide or like, I would help you guide in the direction that you need to improve on. But then, like most of the work is gonna come like afterwards, when you I think when I was working for that Ct, I literally had to just sit down, do like 1 h every single day of practice. And I think that's just gonna be the most challenging part making time to 570 01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:35.680 Jenny Duan: actually practice, like going through each of your questions, understanding like, why you got them wrong. What the correct answer is, and how you can move on and being able to like, push yourself. To do that, I think, is the hardest aspect. 571 01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.810 huda: Yeah. 572 01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:46.290 Ivy Mentors: II think what I would recommend is like again. You know. Let us spend some time, you know, because I'm this is like out of my comfort zone. I have no understanding, but I've taken tests. 573 01:15:46.410 --> 01:16:00.460 Ivy Mentors: So I don't think it's very different. I think it starts with diagnosis. It starts with feedback loop. As to what wrong? So you're absolutely right. Get the report, see your scores, and then use as many resources as possible to understand all the concepts of maths you know that you're struggling with. 574 01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:14.869 Ivy Mentors: I think after that, what I would recommend Jenny is like for you to II you know I don't wanna mix up the sat prep, you know, with your regular cadence, right? I think that again, like we need to. I know that there are one or 2 sessions remaining, and then that we wrap up, and then we just continue with, like, you know. 575 01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.780 Ivy Mentors: you know, 10 more weeks or 24 weeks, or whatnot. Right? Whatever we are we are talking about. 576 01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:31.390 Ivy Mentors: That is, I think with sat what I would recommend from your perspective, Jenny, is like to your point. What like guidance can you give to someone like Houda right now, right like she's she's got this kind of baseline now. 577 01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:37.399 Ivy Mentors: and now the goal is to really boost her score by like 100 points, or 100. 5,200. I don't know. Right? 578 01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:40.480 Ivy Mentors: So what is the strategic guidance that you can give? 579 01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:46.740 Ivy Mentors: Right? I mean, what is the thing that you would do in half an hour, especially for someone like Huda. Because you yourself like think that 580 01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:52.449 Ivy Mentors: you know Hudar doesn't have a problem with terms of motivation and might be, that's not our problem. So 581 01:16:52.740 --> 01:17:12.820 Jenny Duan: I would love to understand. Like, you know, what high impact or strategic guidance can can you give. Yeah, alright. I think these are what my immediate thoughts are. I think first of all, I wanna understand. Is this like A one time thing? Where is it consistent? Because the fact that it's differed so much from the practice test, I think, is a kind of a red flag for me, because 582 01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:36.040 Jenny Duan: I think that like a 100 point difference between your practice test and the real test, like, there's either something wrong with the practice test or like, maybe something stress on the day. But usually that doesn't happen like, usually it stays within like a 50 point increase decrease range. So I think that's a little bit abnormal to me. So that kind of stands out. So I'd like to see maybe you to take another practice test and just 583 01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.369 Jenny Duan: see like if that is also a big range, because if 584 01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:48.340 Jenny Duan: if you're scoring pretty consistently on the practice test like you have been, then I think something like this shouldn't usually happen. 585 01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:54.480 Jenny Duan: so I'd like to see like how you do on another time practice test. So like waking up early 8 am. In the morning like. 586 01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:59.779 Jenny Duan: or maybe 7 Am. Or, however, at what time you had to wake up, and then maybe 587 01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:24.989 Jenny Duan: you can drive to the library to get in the library. In an environment where there's people talking, there might be noise, just like in a real test, like, you can't really control your environment right? It won't always be like quiet, peaceful in your room. You might be in an environment that's a little bit loud, so maybe go out of your house to take it like in the library in an office building somewhere like that, and then take the practices again. Have someone else. Time you give like the 5 min breaks 588 01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:29.080 Jenny Duan: then see what you do from that. And then, after that. 589 01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:45.500 Jenny Duan: I'd like to see a copy of your school report, and then I think, after that what I would do is I would break down like the topics that you need the most help on. And then every like 30 min session just do like a focus review on one of those topics. For however many topics you'd need across like reading, writing, and math. 590 01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:54.769 Jenny Duan: and that should help to alleviate the knowledge gap, and then other than that, like on your own, you should be able to practice 1 HA day, and then from there, like 591 01:18:54.820 --> 01:19:18.779 Jenny Duan: use the answer explanations to your advantage, because every release practice test they have answers right? So look at the answers, and then from those answers they spend a lot of time understanding why every single question is wrong. Why? The correct answer is right? Because on that city there's only one correct answer. There's not multiple correct answers. And there's always going to be a reason why something is correct over the other. So understanding that will help you. And then, I think, just like 592 01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:25.640 Jenny Duan: increasing the number of practices you do, combined with the focus session should be able to help. But 593 01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:36.469 Jenny Duan: I think that definitely increasing 200 points is gonna be really challenging if I'm gonna be honest over the next 2 months. So that's why it's really important to understand. Like, if 594 01:19:36.570 --> 01:20:00.859 Jenny Duan: your baseline is like at 1,300, Ish, because I don't necessarily think that's true, because I think that in your practice test you've scored a lot higher. So I think just the next on the on your next practice. That's it'll be important to see like if this is a recurring trend for you, or if this test was out of an ordinary, so like trying to understand if if your high scores were out of the ordinary, or if this test was out of the ordinary. And then, like through that comparison, 595 01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:07.419 Jenny Duan: like giving an accurate baseline of what is realistically possible. Because again, the timeline is quite short. 596 01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:35.569 Ivy Mentors: Amazing, amazing. Yeah, I think you know, might be like a 30 day plan or 4 week plan, right that you're talking about. And I think just the way you have thought about it. I think it's something that I would also love to create. To be honest, because it's it's a very gen like, it's an important problem, and I can imagine that a lot of students might be doing this down the road as well. I'm sure a lot of people want to increase their score. And I probably think that it's it's it's a huge business out there. Probably lot of lot of people are actually doing that right. So I would love to understand 597 01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:39.360 Ivy Mentors: what's the right process in approaching. I think you've you've laid the next steps. 598 01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:47.060 Ivy Mentors: So, Houda, let's you know I would recommend you getting started. And maybe you can also record right like, first kind of just screen record your thing where 599 01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.850 Ivy Mentors: I think the whole idea is for you, Jenny to be able to really view? 600 01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:56.440 Ivy Mentors: How did she answer, how is she evaluating how she like, you know, I think that's critically important. Correct. 601 01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:25.829 Jenny Duan: yeah, definitely. But also but I wanna emphasize like you should not feel like like a sense that you can't do this like it's not impossible like this is just one score it will not impact with the rest of your life. Don't let this impact your mindset, because, like, obviously, you're very smart, you're capable of achieving high things like you shouldn't let this weigh down on you and affect like your practice, or anything, because, like, it's only this is only one test like, don't let it impact your mindset, because at the end of the day that's the most important thing. 602 01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.990 huda: Yeah, thank you. 603 01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:38.230 Ivy Mentors: Thanks. Cool thanks. I think, Jenny, I'll I'll talk to you like, you know. I'll you know, in our, in our connection on how we kind of approach this at boost. And 604 01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.850 Ivy Mentors: and also, I think. 605 01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:48.279 Ivy Mentors: I still need to look at, you know, a few checkpoints we had, and I think what we'll do is we'll just like add, we'll just extend to those sessions, you know, for for few more months. 606 01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:50.339 Ivy Mentors: and we'll just continue on. The other thing 607 01:21:50.610 --> 01:22:04.649 Jenny Duan: sounds good, thank you. Cool, great. I think we we we had like us connect later this week, I mean on on the product. If you have time, we can do a 1 1 h connect, you know. Let me know, like Thursday, or sometime, or sounds good. I'll text you about my schedule. 608 01:22:04.730 --> 01:22:08.069 Ivy Mentors: Take care, thank you very much. Bye.",

How's it going? 2 00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.610 Jenny Duan: Sure. Give me 1 s just to plug in my computer. 3 00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.200 Jenny Duan: Alright cool. 4 00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, computer. Still not plugged in 5 00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.740 Jenny Duan: there we go. 6 00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.579 Jenny Duan: Okay? So it's been like a week since we've talked okay? 7 00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.390 Jenny Duan: So I think, let's just go right in. 8 00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.790 Jenny Duan: yeah, how's life? I heard about the SAT. We can put a bookmark in that come back to that. But how's life going in general for you? 9 00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:15.889 huda: Well, in terms of S sat. I'm a bit like disappointed in my score. But in other areas I think I'm progressing pretty well. 10 00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.530 huda: I think 11 00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:30.270 huda: we're having some issues like kind of getting traction for empowering AI like having people sign up and everything. We've gotten 3 sign up so far. But I think we need to circulate it more in like our groups. 12 00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.900 huda: But yeah, we've like, sent out, 13 00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.739 huda: like a Facebook post. And like, we've been like messaging. And like, we also have our website up. 14 00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.930 huda: And 15 00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.680 Jenny Duan: he sent me the link for the website. Maybe I can help you share it, too. 16 00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.360 huda: Yeah, okay. 17 00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.779 huda: it's just 18 00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.529 huda: wait 1 s. 19 00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.140 huda: Yeah, that's the website. 20 00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.420 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. 21 00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.920 Jenny Duan: That looks so good. 22 00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.990 huda: Thank you. ",
    "23 00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.700 Jenny Duan: But yeah, so what's what's been happening. So like you've been sharing. hey? 24 00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.620 Jenny Duan: And click in engaging. And you built this website, right? Or did the other person 25 00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.269 huda: yeah, with me? 26 00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.510 Jenny Duan: What? What I guess is happening right now with the 27 00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.140 Jenny Duan: with the project, like what has been the biggest people not signing up? And how how have you been trying to advertise it so far. 28 00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:18.759 huda: So so far, we've tried to put in all like so in our community, like been trying to put in all the Facebook posts. I think we have yet to kind of put it in our personal circles like, but 29 00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:29.009 huda: yeah, I think wouldn't try to like, get our neighbors and everything to sign up. But like we, we tried Facebook, and we had like 3 sign ups. But yeah. 30 00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.869 huda: we're trying to look for a lot more than that. So yeah. 31 00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.300 Jenny Duan: And how long have you been publicizing it for? 32 00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.570 huda: or like. 33 00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.839 huda: I guess, since Friday? Okay, so it's still, like, only been a couple of days. Right? Yeah. 34 00:05:47.420 --> 00:06:16.690 huda: Got it? And I'm wondering, just like, in terms of the advertising. Have you tried to do any other social media channels beyond Facebook, or has that been the main one that you're working on? Oh, yeah, we have our Instagram and then we start posting on there like we did an introductory post, with like details on like who we are, and then at the end, as like a QR code to like join. And then after that, I just like kind of made some random posts like like quotes from 35 00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:25.319 huda: like famous computer science people, and then saying, like, the caption was kind of explaining it. A",
    "nd then, yeah. 36 00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.429 Jenny Duan: maybe I can repost something for you. 37 00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:39.959 huda: Thanks. I saw you got sponsored by Jacob. That's really cool. Oh, yeah, thank you so much. That's been really exciting. 38 00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:49.420 huda: Oh, yeah. And then also, I started posting like more frequently on my professional account. I posted actually, like 39 00:06:49.530 --> 00:07:05.860 huda: a couple posts like one, update 2 updates on my game, and then some random reels like guesses on their phone instead of coding. And that one got a few views like a thousand 300. I think that's a lot. 40 00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.449 huda: Yeah, I was pretty excited about that. 41 00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.359 huda: Okay? And then this is the Instagram. 42 00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.689 huda: You should put your website in the Bio. Yeah, I think, Anita. 43 00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.480 huda: yeah. 44 00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.970 Jenny Duan: I think it'd be nice if you put some quotes from like female AI people. 45 00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.149 huda: yeah, I think. yeah, let me just update our buy real quick. 46 00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.850 Jenny Duan: Well, looks good.

And when did you launch it? 49 00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:18.650 huda: Well, we started the account I guess, a while ago. But then we started posting like. 50 00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.749 huda: I think our first post was on Saturday. Yeah. 51 00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.370 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's only been 2 days. What's your professional Instagram account. 52 00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.330 Jenny Duan: Com.

I think it is 56 00:08:48.350 -",
    "-> 00:08:49.280 huda: yellow. 57 00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.290 Jenny Duan: Got it.

Okay, keep on doing stuff like this like this is really good, like, you already have 17 followers, and you don't follow anyone. Right. So it's like people were organically following you. 64 00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:41.440 huda: Thank you. And then on my tiktok so for homecoming. I was there part of like the filming crew. And we're basically doing like fit checks on everyone. So I kind of recorded the process like like my camera equipment and stuff. And that one got 65 00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.470 huda: 650 views. So yeah. 66 00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.210 Jenny Duan: nice. So it looks like social media is 67 00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.509 Jenny Duan: is doing well for you. It's going well for you. 68 00:09:51.660 --> 00:10:02.220 Jenny Duan: but this is exactly, I think, the right thing to do to like gain recognition for your game 69 00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.820 huda: yeah and then I kind of detailed like 8, 11 license. This one. 70 00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.020 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this is super cool. Are you taking inspiration from any accounts?

She doesn't really have summer content. But like I like her feed. And then also, like, is it a public? Is it like a professional account, o",

She's like a year older than me. 76 00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.069 huda: do you have like a podcast 77 00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.169 huda: I think it's really cool. Well, so 78 00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:59.590 Jenny Duan: this is really cool, you should definitely like definitely do stuff like this like 79 00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.190 Jenny Duan: with the cute feed. And let's look at every account. 80 00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.589 Jenny Duan: although, to be honest, you can, doesn't really matter. It's more just like putting your ideas out there. This one has a lot of so. 81 00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.620 Jenny Duan: But this is really cute. Look at this. 82 00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.320 Jenny Duan: That's cute. 83 00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:29.949 Jenny Duan: Okay, so I'm glad to hear that's going. Well, I feel like sharing more of your empowering a I like on the professional Instagram, and then like trying to boost that through, there will also be a good way to get engagement. The other thing you can do is plug in. Do you know what next door is? 84 00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.169 huda: Oh, yeah, yeah. 85 00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:51.230 huda: If you can put an advertisement on next door, or like print posters, put them in your school, put them in the library stuff like that. That might be nice, too. Yeah, we also, we extended like the age group to ninth grade. Cause I feel like it's kinda easier to access ninth graders given like we're in high school. So 86 00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.409 Jenny Duan: were you able to have you been able to reach freshman at your school? 87 00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:06.519 huda: not yet. But I think I think we're going to send out. We're go",
    "ing to try to send out the email throughout the district. See if we could get like a lot of sign ups from that. 88 00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.600 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And how are you gonna do that? 89 00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:22.150 huda: So we have to contact our, I think the vice principal. And then she'll basically just send out the email like, we'll have to write the email, and then we have to send it to her, and then she can 90 00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.549 huda: spread it. 91 00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.290 Jenny Duan: Did she already say that she would be able to do that like. Have you talked to her about it? 92 00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:33.490 huda: I haven't. But my, I think my Co. Founder has er I mean, not Co. Founder, but Vice President. 93 00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.570 Jenny Duan: And who is the person you talk to? 94 00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.189 huda: Like the Vice president of the school, or the vice principal of the school. 95 00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.440 Jenny Duan: Okay? 96 00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.630 Jenny Duan: And how are you? Planning to reach the middle school audience? 97 00:12:51.980 --> 00:13:08.490 huda: So like the email that she sent out it'll like, go to the entire like district. So basically here, elementary schools and middle schools are combined. So like we'd be able to kinda access like middle schoolers and like freshmen at the same time 98 00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.390 Jenny Duan: got it. Okay. 99 00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:26.159 Jenny Duan: and how has your actual like lectures been going like, how have the slideshow been coming along? And like that. Prep in and of itself. 100 00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:31.730 huda: Yeah. So we were able to finish like, 3 lessons. 101 00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.169 huda: yeah, we just need one more kind of like detailing AI ethics. Yeah. 102 00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:52.030 Jenny Duan: Do you want me to add you to the? This may be good if you publish it. To do you know what in code justice is? 103 00:13:52.630 --> ",
    "00:13:54.150 huda: No. 104 00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.490 Jenny Duan: okay. And it's my friend's name. How runs it? 105 00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.469 I bet they have local varied chapters that you can also share it with. 106 00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.880 Jenny Duan: Okay, their website's being a little slow. 107 00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.049 Jenny Duan: Yeah, they have like workshops. 108 00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.389 Jenny Duan: let's see. 109 00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.310 Jenny Duan: encode justice. I don't know if encodes has a bay area. 110 00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.160 Jenny Duan: and 111 00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:59.680 Jenny Duan: I feel like this is a good organization to get you involved in, though let me just add you really quickly to their slack. I think that should be fine. 112 00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.770 Jenny Duan: what is your okay? Never mind. 113 00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:14.650 Jenny Duan: It's Huda Saraj. But the Raj is a 4 right@gmail.com. 114 00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.220 Okay. 115 00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.370 Jenny Duan: I'm just going to invite you to the slack. 116 00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.529 Jenny Duan: And then, 117 00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.740 Jenny Duan: okay, can you check your email to see if you've received that? 118 00:15:28.840 --> 00:16:02.610 huda: okay, yeah, I got an invite. Yeah. 119 00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:12.780 Jenny Duan: then another thing that you can do is maybe reach out to other like tech for change. So some organizations in the around the Bay area and then try to reach out to them, too. 120 00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.349 Jenny Duan: You can also publish it on. Do you remember Hatclub? Like signing up for a hat club? Their slack. 121 00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:26.010 huda: Yeah, also publish it. There. Is it going to be a virtual conference or like a virtual lesson, or in person? Have you decided 100? 122 00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:42.620 huda: We were gonna do in person. But I think virtual like it must be like easier to kind of ",
    "access more people. I feel like cause in person. I don't think many people really have that like commitment. So 123 00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.990 huda: I think I think we might do it online. Yeah. 124 00:16:47.580 --> 00:17:02.390 Jenny Duan: maybe you can do the invite form and say like, do you have a preference in person in Mount Hen House, or Virtual? And then just have that as an option. And then from the number of sign ups you can get. If people are selecting more of the virtual option, then maybe you can just offer it virtually 125 00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.959 huda: Okay, what do you think about that idea? 126 00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:21.599 huda: Originally, I was actually gonna do like in person and then we'd have like kind of at the same time we'd have like cameras and stuff. So that and then like have that on zoom. So it's kind of both like people that are not in Mountain House they'd be able to join still. But 127 00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.809 Jenny Duan: that's a good idea, too. Have you? Do you? Does your library have the type of camera setup that you can use. 128 00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.290 huda: No, but I could probably bring my own camera. 129 00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.789 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds like a good idea, too. Let me. Just 130 00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:56.620 Jenny Duan: so. I think the the places that you can try to reach are in code, justice network hat club next door, which is more like community based. But next door is a good platform, and then, obviously, the schools as well. Are there any other organizations that you plan to reach out to? 131 00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:13.060 huda: so I don't know, cause II was kind of thinking that this would be more local. I wasn't sure that I'd be able to share it with like other outside organizations cause I thought it'd be only in Mount House. But 132 00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.699 huda: what about the virtual option then 133 00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:23.769 Jenny Duan: like if people were not in Moun",
    "t House? Would you think they'd be able to join virtually, or would you not want them to like? Only keep it to Mount House people? 134 00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:31.879 huda: I think it's better if, like, more people join, I guess because we'd have like a higher impact on like more people. 135 00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:44.239 Jenny Duan: Right? So I guess with that, do you wanna keep offering it to like. Do you want to revise your invite, or what do you? What do you and your like vice president think? 136 00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:55.569 huda: I can talk to her, but I think what I'm thinking is like we'll probably extend it to not just Mount House, and maybe 137 00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:03.329 huda: like. I don't know if in person we should even offer in person. Because honestly, I feel like 138 00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:14.450 huda: it'll be kinda odd, because only like a few people will show up to the in person. And then, if we're getting most of our people from like out of Mountain House, then And I think it'll just be better if we just do fully online. 139 00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.860 Jenny Duan: got it? Maybe you could do like a 140 00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:25.189 Jenny Duan: yeah, maybe wait one more week and then see how many in person sign ups you can get first. 141 00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.249 Jenny Duan: and then after that, like, if you can't get in person, sign up, send you online. Cause. Have you already had to book the 142 00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.440 Jenny Duan: the library conference room? Or has that already been booked? 143 00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:46.669 huda: We are waiting for to see, like how many people are interested. Cause there's like like a fee. So like we just want to make sure that, like everyone's interested. 144 00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:57.150 Jenny Duan: be honest. So maybe it might be easier to then do it virtually if you're not able to get a good number of people, because then you know also not just. You just don't have to pay the fee as well, too 14",
    "5 00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:02.880 Jenny Duan: awesome. Okay, so how's the how's the actual game coming along? 146 00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:16.410 huda: I think it's going on going along really great. I've also been like trying to work on like uploading my code onto Github so that I can share it and then. 147 00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:30.619 huda: in terms of like the actual game. I think that I've made like a lot of progress, because I've started actually like making the scene which they go into like kind of fixing the robot 148 00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:38.920 huda: like. I've started the art for that one. But I just kind of finish the part where you talk to the like, the 149 00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:48.609 huda: professor, and then you kind of go to the next scene, where you have to learn about the Progress regression model. And then kind of like, what are the differences? 150 00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.709 Jenny Duan: Got it cool? So 151 00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:52.770 oops. 152 00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.090 Jenny Duan: Then? 153 00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:06.379 Jenny Duan: with the small business project, how's that going? 154 00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:14.759 huda: Yeah. So I think I'm progressing on the website. I think I'm trying to make it more of kind of like, a 155 00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:33.749 huda: like kind of like a blog kind of style website. So that if I need. If I do get the chance to interview them as a video I'd still be able to implement that. But I think now, I'm kind of trying to focus more on writing like an article about them and kind of who they are and getting that out. 156 00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:42.879 Jenny Duan: Have you had more success getting people to work with you doing the blogs like, have you gotten any responses to your interview? Requests? 157 00:21:43.240 --> 00:22:00.619 huda: Yeah. So there's like this one business. They do like clothing, and they sent me like lots of details about their business. And I'm actually almost. Well, I'm not almost done",
    ". But like I started working on their like article. 158 00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:08.139 Jenny Duan: I'll I'll just show you. But like they they send like a lot of information. I'd love to see it.

Hmm! 164 00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:09.320 Jenny Duan: You want to share your screen. Maybe if that's easiest or whatever's easiest for you. I think I can.

I think they're kinda like focus more on like they were talk about like how they, their production is in Pakistan. And then they have like people there, who are like working. And they're trying to show that they kinda only employ women, and they kinda make stuff for women. So they in the end they kinda wanted to say, like, we are women, and we wanna support women, and they kind of 174 00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:14.109 huda: go into detail with like their own lives, like one of them is an attorney, and one of them is a stay at home, mom.

We're able to finish that.

Yeah. 179 00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.909 huda: And it's this is the new essay, right at the one under the new version using more imagery. 180 00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:58.969 huda: Okay? And like my dad, I think he's saying there's 2 less imagery, so maybe if we could change make changes on that. 181 00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.510 Jenny Duan: okay, in seventh grade debate class I 182 00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.210 Jenny Duan: and 183 00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.159 Jenny Duan: this is Chachi, Pt 184 00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.060 Jenny Duan: is this tragedy boutique. 185 00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:24.329 huda: I asked it to give me like suggestions on like, what I can kind of use as my imagery.

So, to be to be honest, I think trachivity is a great tool. I'm not saying, Don't use tractivity. I think trachivity is great, but I think that 188 00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:50.970 Jenny Duan: sometimes chat G, Vt, writing sounds like chat, GVVT. I think that this sounds a little bit like child gpu. So I think we should rewrite it. But just 189 00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.850 huda: take away the parts of sound, too. GPT, yeah. ",

And then I had to argue for bad for you, but I didn't really agree with that at the time, because 195 00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:34.939 huda: I was kind of like a gamer at that time, and I didn't really understand that gaming could be bad 196 00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.840 Jenny Duan: right in seventh grade to play class. 197 00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.899 huda: Okay, it's okay.

And then as many links as possible, I think, will be good, because part of the way that they evaluate you is just based on your commitment to computer science. So as long as you're able to show that you have a lot of existing computer science interests, you have that background. That'll be really cool. 370 00:47:50.280 --> 00:48:01.939 Jenny Duan: So I think that right now all of your essays, because we've talked about the most recent one, and then the rest of the ones that we covered last time should be good to submit. So once you film your screen cap or your screen recording up 371 00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:08.860 Jenny Duan: the game, then you should be feeling confident to submit. Do you hav",
    "e your teacher recommendations and everything else in place? 372 00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.059 huda: Do we need teacher recommendations for this information? 373 00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:26.059 Jenny Duan: in the past they have. But actually, I don't think they do this yearly. Would you be able to check really quickly? Yeah, I'm gonna open it. I 374 00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.449 Jenny Duan: I don't necessarily think so. 375 00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:33.249 Jenny Duan: I don't think they do this year, but I think in the past they may have 376 00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.070 Jenny Duan: let me also check. 377 00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.999 huda: Yeah, we don't need a teacher recommendation. 378 00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:04.560 Jenny Duan: Then you should be good to submit. Just after this call, once you film your screen cap. how awesome. 379 00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:10.569 Jenny Duan: Okay? And then the other thing is, how is film called going. And what's your plan for making progress with that? 380 00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:32.129 huda: Yeah. So we actually started writing our script. This weekend we had like a officer's meeting. And we basically synthesize like our first idea, I think already told you. But it was like, basically a parody of breaking bad where this time we kind of like specified like the details like we hashed out like it's gonna be about like 381 00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:51.610 huda: he needs like a hair transplant. So he starts writing people's essays at school, and then and then, like his principal, starts like like suspecting him. And then he asked for like a cut, and his money also exposed him. And yeah, it's kinda like so much the actual plot. But yeah. 382 00:49:51.680 --> 00:50:04.960 huda: and then we're having a meeting next Monday to kinda get our actors like assigned and everything. But we're meeting with pre-production on Thursday. 383 00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:17.089 Jenny Duan: Awesome sounds good. And then the other thing I wanted to check in with you was",
    " about the Congressional App challenge. Is this still something that you are working on, or planning to do with your VP. For empowering a I 384 00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:28.410 huda: I wanna continue it. But honestly. I'm wondering like cause she doesn't really know how to code, but she still wants to do it with me and like 385 00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:39.980 huda: I kinda wanna like apply by myself, cause she's not really doing anything. And I might just like code it by myself and like try to apply. But 386 00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:52.160 huda: I guess it's good to keep a good relationship, since she is like my partner for one of my nonprofits. but yeah, that's what I'm kinda concerned about. But yeah, I think we like 387 00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:59.390 huda: haven't made much progress on that, honestly. But we should. We're going to try focusing on remorse as the due date is coming up. 388 00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.129 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I feel like you should definitely just do that by yourself. 389 00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:18.520 Jenny Duan: Because I think having a partner who doesn't encode will probably slow you down. So, if you like, maybe just maintain your relationship with her. But just like find a way to tell her that you like. Want to do it yourself, you know, or just don't bring it up to her. She doesn't ask about it. 390 00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:33.189 Jenny Duan: Okay, now that we've submitted this, or we're planning to submit this Aic award. I think it'd be valuable to think about transitioning our focus to preparing your summer as like this Junior Year Senior Year. Summer is very important. 391 00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:50.899 Jenny Duan: So one thing I wanna bring into your attention something that just opened is the leadership seminars program with Notre Dame. And this is a pretty cool program, because it's only 10 days long. So you could obviously do other things when you're doing this in the summer, too. But it's a free program at Notre Dame. They have, like di",
    "fferent 392 00:51:50.990 --> 00:52:03.080 Jenny Duan: topic. So, for example, business, what is it good for global issues? Inequality in America, the environment, the power of investing. And I've did this program when it was online. But usually they go in person. So 393 00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:11.459 Jenny Duan: because to go spend 10 days on campus, meet other like intelligent people who are doing the program and learn about the topic of your choice. So 394 00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:15.429 Jenny Duan: I'm wondering if this is something that you'd be interested in. And 395 00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:18.169 Jenny Duan: yeah, if you'd like to apply. 396 00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.510 huda: Yeah, I know what you're saying. 397 00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.230 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. 398 00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:40.190 Jenny Duan: So yeah, it's a free program, which means it's super competitive, which means it also like sort of functions as an award on your application. So I think that that'd be really valuable to you. So after we finish wrapping up and submitting the Nc wit one, we'll turn our focus to doing this and also starting to look at the other summer programs that are, you know, 399 00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.890 Jenny Duan: opening up applications. This cycle? 400 00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:56.060 Jenny Duan: Cool. So with our last 8 min, I want to talk about really debriefing your sat, how you felt there. And maybe if we can make like a plan for I think you're signed up for November. Right? 401 00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:01.950 Jenny Duan: okay. So I just love to hear about like how that experience went for you, and like 402 00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:09.340 Jenny Duan: you said, felt easy, but then it maybe was harder than imagined, so I'd love to hear your perspective on how that went for you. 403 00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.829 huda: I think 404 00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:37.620 huda: what kind of went wrong was a math section cause. I had a 700 on reading and writing, and then a 6, 20",
    " on math, and I'm not sure I got that low like I knew I'd get a lower score. For that one cause it was definitely harder than the reading section. I did feel like, kind of like the no calculator question. They had some questions that 405 00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:50.190 huda: where on any of my practice test like I think there was one where there's like circles inside of a square, and then you're given like the radius and then I think you have to find, like the perimeter of the square, or something like that. 406 00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:54.560 huda: That was something that was confusing, and also like 407 00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.629 huda: for some of the questions. Like, I think there was one 408 00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.560 huda: like 409 00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:10.959 huda: I guess I can't really explain it, but it was like one of those kinda inequality questions. And that really tripped me up. 410 00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:28.559 huda: And I thought, Okay, I thought it would be a little better than I actually did. And I went to the cross cross test like examination thing and it said that my heart of algebra is like the lowest. I think it said 411 00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:33.209 huda: so. That's something that I need to focus on 412 00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.099 huda: And I think just like 413 00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:41.829 huda: studying. I need to like kind of focus more on my math. I think I can share, like 414 00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.760 huda: where I kind of messed up. 415 00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:50.380 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that'd be great. I don't think I can log in. So that might be something that you have to like. 416 00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:57.059 Jenny Duan: screen, share, or like. Take screenshots of, because I don't have access to your account. Obviously. 417 00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:03.130 huda: I'll just share like cause it doesn't give you like what questions you got wrong. But I'll show you like 418 00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:09.090 huda: it shows you like what lik",
    "e topics you kinda got wrong on 419 00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:19.659 huda: So you said that this one felt easier than your your previous exams. 420 00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:24.849 Jenny Duan: Do you still feel that way after getting your score back? Or do you think that 421 00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:33.500 Jenny Duan: like, do you think that it was an issue with the curb? Or do you think that like what made you feel, I guess, more confident after taking this one compared to the ones in the past. 422 00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:58.589 huda: I feel like the beginning. Questions were definitely like a lot like really easy, like they're asking like really simple questions in the beginning. Obviously, I think, like the bubble in questions were like a lot more tough than than like the first few questions for each of the math sections. So I think the beginning part kind of like boosted my confidence. 423 00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:05.859 huda: and I guess that's why I kinda thought it was going. Better. Let me just. I'll share my screen for 424 00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:20.509 Ivy Mentors: and Jenny, just for my understanding, I mean, do these exams like. are they pretty much like same comp like, I mean, II think that it should be normalized in some ways, right? Like the complexity and the 425 00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:26.249 Ivy Mentors: how hard it is. But of course, there's always gonna be like a deviant factor. Right? 426 00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, mostly not the same. 427 00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:31.719 Jenny Duan: Some of them kind of have 428 00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:45.610 Jenny Duan: like a curve. So if the questions are harder, usually the curve will be better. So like you'll get more points, even if you like, missed questions. But if it just is easier than the curve might be harsher. So like you might get a lower 429 00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:49.689 Jenny Duan: score, even if you've missed the same amount of questions. So that's only different. 430 00:56:53.210 --> 00:56",
    ":56.359 Ivy Mentors: Interesting. I'm also trying to understand this. 431 00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:05.429 huda: Yeah, I think also, I was struggling with like there was a few triangle questions. And I think I need to focus more on that one studying as well. 432 00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:09.599 huda: have you tried downloading your score report. 433 00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.810 huda: me try. Now. 434 00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:19.579 Jenny Duan: I think if you go to test questions you might be able to see what you got wrong. Also. 435 00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:26.770 huda: I think you have to purchase it now. Which fine you you can purchase these things? I said, these are important, right? 436 00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.059 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think I purchased mine, and I think it was helpful for me 437 00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.660 Jenny Duan: when I took it. 438 00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.099 Ivy Mentors: Wow! This is a good report. Hmm, interesting. 439 00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:55.899 Jenny Duan: Okay? So it looks like your history and social sciences is really good. yeah, it looks like the heart of algebra 440 00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:58.040 huda: is the lowest. 441 00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:00.109 Jenny Duan: Can you scroll down to the rest? 442 00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.750 Jenny Duan: Okay. 443 00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:12.229 huda: so you're registered for the November, SAT. Right? Yes. 444 00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:20.080 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! How do you feel about taking it in November? I'll tell you my recommendation, but I'd love to know like what you feel first. 445 00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:26.809 huda: I think I have like like my school work isn't too 446 00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:36.940 huda: like hard right now, so I think I'll have like a lot of time to, you know, like focus on the sat. And I kinda wanna prioritize the SAT. The most this week. 447 00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.880 huda: Like these next 2 weeks, and I think. 448 00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:57.139 huda: given like. Now that",
    " I know, like how the experience of actually taking a test is, I think, I'll be able to test myself on like the practices in really similar conditions. And kind of like note, which type of questions I kind of need to work on more. 449 00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.600 You feel like you weren't taking the practice test in testing conditions. 450 00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.110 huda: Ii feel like 451 00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:19.360 huda: the the breaks. I think we're definitely different cause. I took longer than 5 min break so maybe that could be like one of the differences. But I mean, like obviously timing was the same but 452 00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.989 huda: oh, yeah. And then, also, like, in our actual testing, we have like, really quick breaks, like 5 min. 453 00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.820 huda: We didn't have any. 10 min breaks. So I was. 454 00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:37.710 huda: I thought we had a 10 min break in the sat. But yeah, they gave us like like 2, 5 min breaks 455 00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.269 Jenny Duan: in between which sections 456 00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:44.490 huda: in between reading and writing, and then I think. 457 00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:48.330 huda: writing and math. 458 00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:50.620 huda: the first math section. 459 00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:54.360 Jenny Duan: That's interesting. That usually is not how it goes. But 460 00:59:54.970 --> 01:00:16.709 huda: do you feel like that made a big difference that 5 min like you're between the reading writing and the math section. Yeah, I think II think like if I had more time like I'd have been able to kind of like kinda calm down and kinda like, get ready for the next section, you know, cause they like barely gave us time to go to the bathroom, and then the girls bathroom was like locked in. 461 01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:24.719 huda: I don't know. I just feel like they could have handled it better, maybe. But II think it's on me. I could have like focused better. But yeah. 462 01:00:25.010 --> 0",
    "1:00:29.270 Jenny Duan: that makes sense. Do you feel like it was more of a mental issue. Do you feel like it was a knowledge issue? 463 01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.749 Jenny Duan: Did it have to do with your perspective and confidence? Or was it that you didn't know how to do things? 464 01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:44.510 huda: I think it must have been confidence because I felt pretty good after eating it. But like, I don't know clearly by the scores. I don't think 465 01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:49.010 huda: my like confidence in the questions. I don't think they were correct. Yeah. 466 01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:57.579 Ivy Mentors: yeah, because I was there with her. Right? Like. So for me, also, it was a bit surprising, because, you know, II also gave you like a real time kind of excitement, because 467 01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:08.120 Ivy Mentors: it's always you know, kind of top of mind like she comes out. And she had a very she was quite confident. So what I'm really concerned about is more like, you know, 468 01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:14.540 Ivy Mentors: is, is Huda able to really kind of evaluate or self assess herself? You know, when she's scoring her practice test. 469 01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:26.519 Ivy Mentors: Is that automated? Or is that something she manually does? Because I don't have details on that. So I'm just trying to understand where the the gaps are also like from a feedback loop perspective. And she's practicing right? 470 01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.739 Jenny Duan: Yeah, maybe one thing we can test Huda is 471 01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:37.600 huda: Oh, I think you cut out. 472 01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:56.360 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think she'll probably might be joining. 473 01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.020 Ivy Mentors: So oh, I didn't know. This is a good 474 01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:26.480 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. I think that maybe one thing we can try is when you take your practice. Maybe you can take it in a different room. So not in your bedroom we try to find like a bla",
    "nk, like a study room, maybe in your house, and then have someone else time you so have like a parent sibling 475 01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:33.330 Jenny Duan: siri, like a Amazon home. Something else time you. And then when you're taking it try to 476 01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:52.109 Jenny Duan: like, take it under the testing circumstances like. So only give yourself a 5 min break, and then at the end, before you score it. One exercise that you can try is trying to guess your score, or try to guess how many questions you get wrong, and then score it, and then see how much your prediction goes with the score, and that will give you a better way to evaluate 477 01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.100 Jenny Duan: and but I think, that 478 01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:06.420 Jenny Duan: okay, so you know that after december, the test is going to shift to virtual right? 479 01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:09.210 Jenny Duan: And so because of that, 480 01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.780 huda: I think you're set on taking the paper test. Right? Yeah. 481 01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.589 Jenny Duan: Okay? Because of that, that means that you have the November test and the December test right 482 01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:24.240 Jenny Duan: left, and then there's always the act right. Have you ever taken the act? 483 01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.060 huda: I've taken a practice test. I got like a 29, I think. 484 01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.449 Jenny Duan: Okay, do you feel like the act is harder? The Sct. Or they're about the same for you. 485 01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:49.510 huda: I feel like a CT. Is kinda harder, just because, like the signs section is like really confusing for me. And maybe I need to practice. But like I just feel like it's a lot more like difficult than the signs passages in the SAT. 486 01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:51.790 Jenny Duan: Okay, 487 01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:58.350 huda: how much time do you have to dedicate to your city. I think that 2 weeks. So November ninth at first. Right? Yeah. 488 01:03:58.7",
    "90 --> 01:04:02.189 Jenny Duan: Think November fourth, November fourth. 489 01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.480 Jenny Duan: I think 2 weeks is too short to bring your score up. 490 01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:17.990 Jenny Duan: Think you shall wait until the December test, because I think you won't see a significant improvement in 2 weeks. In my opinion. I think that that's challenging. So I think that, you know, waiting until 491 01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:25.420 Jenny Duan: December might be a good idea for you, and then also, like as you continue to practice. Maybe. Do you do it with the bubble sheets? 492 01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:26.830 huda: Yeah. 493 01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:30.239 Jenny Duan: But will she have someone else grade it for you? 494 01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.100 Ivy Mentors: Yeah, I think we lost you, Jenny, again 495 01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:40.089 Jenny Duan: rest. And then I take it in December. 496 01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:51.300 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think that you take tests too many times. That's also on your record, so that might not be the best idea. So I think, just don't stress. Wait till December. Take it, and then, if that doesn't go well, hopefully, it does. 497 01:04:51.890 --> 01:05:17.149 huda: If it doesn't go well, you can also try the act or go test optional. More and more schools are doing that, especially like the University of California schools. They don't even look at your test, regardless of whether or not you take them. So there's always like a you know, a solution. Is there a way to cancel the the sat test then? Because, we already like paid for it, and like booked in everything so like. 498 01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:23.620 huda: and we also pay like the late fees. So I'm not sure if that like if you'd be able to get a refund or anything. 499 01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:36.440 Ivy Mentors: Figure that out, I think. Yeah, that's a good concern. But I think I kind of tend to agree with you. Jenny, that was my feeling as well. I think the thought process ",
    "that Houda had 500 01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:45.100 Ivy Mentors: was more like, Hey, it's kinda gonna be like a practice test, if not right? So. But II think to your point 501 01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.739 Ivy Mentors: number one like, you know, it goes on your record. 502 01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.900 Ivy Mentors: And you know 503 01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:59.260 Ivy Mentors: if if I mean, I think the downside is like, if that's one, it goes on the record. And second thing like, if if you don't get a good score, then actually, it's not good for morale, too. Right? 504 01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:07.900 Ivy Mentors: So I think that was my thinking as well. So I I'm actually also not I also don't recommend, like, you know, taking like back to back 505 01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.630 Ivy Mentors: might be a bit more like thinking and strategizing and practicing more will be helpful so that's my thought too, actually. 506 01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.360 Jenny Duan: yeah, and I'm wondering like. 507 01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:39.799 Jenny Duan: if you would be able to go to like an SAT prep. Service. Are you looking for like external tutors? Because I think that being able to have, like a guided prep like 3 times a week, would be beneficial. Because it is a pretty short timeframe like, even if you took in December, you still only have a month, maybe like a month and 2 weeks. So it is still a big crunch, even if you take it in December. 508 01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:46.340 huda: Yeah, we could probably find like a like a tutoring service for the SAT, yeah. 509 01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:57.360 Ivy Mentors: Yeah. So like, yeah, I mean, you know, actually, samia's Samia, like, you know my older daughter, I did send her like I did sign up her to like one of these services. 510 01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.879 Ivy Mentors: and you know they kind of give all this books, and you know, same strategies same like. They just kind of resell the same thing 511 01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:12.080 Ivy Mentors: I like. ",
    "I was just wondering, like, you know, what? What is the real kind of benefit that these services offer, Jenny, I know that you also wear a sack tutor. You said you have actually. 512 01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.150 Jenny Duan: I would actually rather prefer like. If we can see a way where you can actually spend more time with Huda like that could be a good way 513 01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:25.789 Ivy Mentors: unless you feel like you might, you know, might might be. There's something that might be hard for you to kind of focus on with. Houda. 514 01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.270 Ivy Mentors: Let me know. Yeah. 515 01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.850 Jenny Duan: I feel like 516 01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.249 Jenny Duan: nicely to tutor is 517 01:07:35.370 --> 01:08:00.250 Jenny Duan: to just to get students to study, like I think, in my opinion, that's the most benefit is just to have a time where they can answer questions, work through examples, and just sit down with the student. Because I think, as a student like, it's very hard to make the time to like, actually study yourself. So, having someone to motivate you, I think, is what I see the main purpose of. An however, I don't think that's good as issue right now, because I feel like she's already 518 01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:12.569 Jenny Duan: is putting in the time to study. So that's why I'm like I don't know how much of a help I could be, because usually with my clients like that's their main issues like they don't study. So then I able to help them work through examples. But 519 01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:20.829 Jenny Duan: I think that if it's a knowledge gap, then that might be a little bit more like need, maybe more professional help 520 01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:34.729 Jenny Duan: But I'm not. I think that would have to see like if Huda, if you think your issue is a knowledge issue like a content issue, or if it's like a not understanding the test format or structure, or like practice timing type of issue. 521 01:08:36.990 --> 0",
    "1:08:40.599 huda: Yeah, so I'd say, like. it's kind of like 522 01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:47.109 huda: some of the sentence, or like some of the questions. Structures are a bit confusing to me. 523 01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:48.310 huda: like. 524 01:08:48.880 --> 01:09:09.090 huda: yeah, there's like some specific ones that just I don't really understand but other than that, I think timing isn't that much of an issue for me, cause I do have like a lot of free time, which I think maybe cause I was trying to use that time to go back on my questions. But honestly, whenever I was checking all my questions. They were like, right? So 525 01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:14.199 huda: I don't know. I think it's probably like my work is incorrect or something like that. 526 01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:25.650 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that for me, what I found most useful when I was preparing for the SAT. Is because my issue was just like there were some topics I wasn't that familiar with. So I just 527 01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:32.689 Jenny Duan: bought like a test bank. I use U world. I don't know if I'd recommend this to everyone. This is just what I did 528 01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:34.960 Jenny Duan: But 529 01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:40.559 Jenny Duan: I did U world, which is just a online like test bank. 530 01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:43.949 Jenny Duan: And it gives like, sample SAT questions. And 531 01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:53.339 Jenny Duan: I just like bought like a 3 month subscription. I did all the questions in there, and that was what helped me. But again, I don't know if I would recommend that to everyone. 532 01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:55.639 Jenny Duan: I think that a good model, too, like 533 01:09:56.470 --> 01:10:00.440 huda: I've heard about like this web site. I think it's 1,600 a I/O 534 01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:09.380 huda: This one, I think, like I've heard about this one. 535 01:10:10.650 --> 01:10:23.980 Ivy Mentors: I I'm sure there are. Daima doesn't like kind of things. I think. What is ",
    "more important, I feel like is first really finding what her week areas are, I think, and that Hooda can really help understand by like I think, based on what you've done. 536 01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:30.789 Ivy Mentors: I think to me that that's really important to really understand what the root causes. Where are the weak spots? And then working on that? 537 01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:42.099 Ivy Mentors: I don't necessarily think that access to questions or any type of platforms and services is actually a challenge, because I was just like every other day, that's a new platform for sat. And A/C. To be honest, right? 538 01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.540 Ivy Mentors: So 539 01:10:44.710 --> 01:11:02.600 Jenny Duan: right? Yeah, I think we do. I think what might be beneficial for you is to go through like a topic by topic breakdown of the sat specifically the math section, and then review all those concepts like one by one. And I think that Khan Academy is a great resource for that. 540 01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:26.219 Jenny Duan: I think that if you wanted to hire like an external tutor to walk you through that that's also possible, but not necessarily necessary, I think, but just having a breakdown of like a step by step. Topic guide on the sat would be really helpful, I think, and I think a lot of the sat is about applying existing concepts to different issues. For example, like the perimeter of a square. 541 01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:31.040 huda: You said that question was like a circle and a square right? And find the perimeter. Right? Yeah. 542 01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:36.070 Jenny Duan: So how would you approach that question if you were to answer it right now. 543 01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:55.829 huda: I wasn't sure, so I just I doubled the the radius to be the circle or the diameter, and then and then I set that as one of the sides, and then I multiply that by 4. 544 01:11:55.930 --> 01:12:01.580 huda: And that was my answer. That wasn't correct. Yeah, I don't think so. 545 01:",
    "12:02.330 --> 01:12:14.910 Jenny Duan: How do you know if that wasn't correct? If you can't see your answer score for so I feel like you should get your score report. Find out what you actually miss, and then from there find out what topics you struggle the most with, because 546 01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:23.809 Jenny Duan: it says that heart of algebra is your issue not necessarily like passport to advance math, which is what I think geometry would fall under. 547 01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:24.730 Jenny Duan: because 548 01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:29.579 Jenny Duan: I think algebra doesn't have to like. That's not an algebra question. That's a geometry question. 549 01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:33.189 huda: I think the algebra maybe like 550 01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:40.620 huda: like a number of solutions, those type of questions. That one. I was a bit. 551 01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:44.120 huda: I think that was one of the ones I was confused about. Yeah. 552 01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:48.569 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think I would recommend. Yeah, sorry. Go ahead, Jen. 553 01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:49.670 Jenny Duan: No, go ahead. 554 01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:51.249 Ivy Mentors: No, no, that's fine. So 555 01:12:51.340 --> 01:13:01.810 Ivy Mentors: I think. Yeah, II mean, II feel like, you know, conceptually, I think she should be strong. So I think, going and you know, maps is actually, I mean, I would say that 556 01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:11.490 Ivy Mentors: she needs to spend time and go through these concepts right? It's I don't think it's it's it's gonna be like, the information is just gonna be available. II don't think that's actually scarce. 557 01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:22.190 Ivy Mentors: So identifying where our gaps are, and and practicing those concepts. And then to your point applying comes only with practice. Right? If I'm not mistaken and might be, if she needs like extra sessions. You can help her. 558 01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.470 Ivy Mentors: My only challenge is this right? I have sent",
    " my older daughter to these stress prep places. 559 01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:34.650 Ivy Mentors: and all they do is they really package it so well? And they they give you all these booklets and pamphlets, and you know, some software tools. 560 01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:52.350 Ivy Mentors: But I think it's no different than, honestly speaking, like a tool online. Right? For example, right? II would rather just go with that unless there's someone who's actually spending time and sitting like, you know, one on one, and might be there are tutors in some platforms out there, right? Who actually are really specialized in in sat, for example, right? 561 01:13:52.680 --> 01:14:02.680 Jenny Duan: I think here's what we can do. Maybe we can do so normally, we have an hour and a half every week, right? So that's maybe we can do like 562 01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:06.970 Jenny Duan: 3 30 min sessions, or we can do like 563 01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:22.839 Jenny Duan: 1 h. We can dedicate 1 h to your normal check ins and then do like extra. I think you need 3 sessions a week for the sat like, I think, regardless of it's me or someone else. I think just 3 sessions a week is a baseline, because you only have one month to go, so 564 01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:26.379 Jenny Duan: it has to be like pretty regular check-ins. 565 01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:31.220 Jenny Duan: but I think that somehow we can incorporate, maybe like 566 01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:43.969 Jenny Duan: 3 sessions a week into helping you with your sat. I think that would be okay with me, too, just depending on, like, how much time you wanna spend on this per session. It could be like 30 min, or it could be like 1 h sessions. Kind of 567 01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:51.010 Jenny Duan: yeah, depending on how you're feeling. I think 30 min, maybe 3 sessions will be 30 min would be enough. 568 01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:58.149 Jenny Duan: Because again, like the majority of the work is just gonna be coming from repetitive practice, like 569 01:14:5",
    "8.240 --> 01:15:23.599 Jenny Duan: having someone to sit with you or having an individual tutor is not gonna fix all your problems. It's more like you have to. The tutor is gonna help you like guide or like, I would help you guide in the direction that you need to improve on. But then, like most of the work is gonna come like afterwards, when you I think when I was working for that Ct, I literally had to just sit down, do like 1 h every single day of practice. And I think that's just gonna be the most challenging part making time to 570 01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:35.680 Jenny Duan: actually practice, like going through each of your questions, understanding like, why you got them wrong. What the correct answer is, and how you can move on and being able to like, push yourself. To do that, I think, is the hardest aspect. 571 01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.810 huda: Yeah. 572 01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:46.290 Ivy Mentors: II think what I would recommend is like again. You know. Let us spend some time, you know, because I'm this is like out of my comfort zone. I have no understanding, but I've taken tests. 573 01:15:46.410 --> 01:16:00.460 Ivy Mentors: So I don't think it's very different. I think it starts with diagnosis. It starts with feedback loop. As to what wrong? So you're absolutely right. Get the report, see your scores, and then use as many resources as possible to understand all the concepts of maths you know that you're struggling with. 574 01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:14.869 Ivy Mentors: I think after that, what I would recommend Jenny is like for you to II you know I don't wanna mix up the sat prep, you know, with your regular cadence, right? I think that again, like we need to. I know that there are one or 2 sessions remaining, and then that we wrap up, and then we just continue with, like, you know. 575 01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.780 Ivy Mentors: you know, 10 more weeks or 24 weeks, or whatnot. Right? Whatever we are we are talking about. 576 01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:31.390 Iv",
    "y Mentors: That is, I think with sat what I would recommend from your perspective, Jenny, is like to your point. What like guidance can you give to someone like Houda right now, right like she's she's got this kind of baseline now. 577 01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:37.399 Ivy Mentors: and now the goal is to really boost her score by like 100 points, or 100. 5,200. I don't know. Right? 578 01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:40.480 Ivy Mentors: So what is the strategic guidance that you can give? 579 01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:46.740 Ivy Mentors: Right? I mean, what is the thing that you would do in half an hour, especially for someone like Huda. Because you yourself like think that 580 01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:52.449 Ivy Mentors: you know Hudar doesn't have a problem with terms of motivation and might be, that's not our problem. So 581 01:16:52.740 --> 01:17:12.820 Jenny Duan: I would love to understand. Like, you know, what high impact or strategic guidance can can you give. Yeah, alright. I think these are what my immediate thoughts are. I think first of all, I wanna understand. Is this like A one time thing? Where is it consistent? Because the fact that it's differed so much from the practice test, I think, is a kind of a red flag for me, because 582 01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:36.040 Jenny Duan: I think that like a 100 point difference between your practice test and the real test, like, there's either something wrong with the practice test or like, maybe something stress on the day. But usually that doesn't happen like, usually it stays within like a 50 point increase decrease range. So I think that's a little bit abnormal to me. So that kind of stands out. So I'd like to see maybe you to take another practice test and just 583 01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.369 Jenny Duan: see like if that is also a big range, because if 584 01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:48.340 Jenny Duan: if you're scoring pretty consistently on the practice test like you have been, then I think something like this shouldn't usually ha",
    "ppen. 585 01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:54.480 Jenny Duan: so I'd like to see like how you do on another time practice test. So like waking up early 8 am. In the morning like. 586 01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:59.779 Jenny Duan: or maybe 7 Am. Or, however, at what time you had to wake up, and then maybe 587 01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:24.989 Jenny Duan: you can drive to the library to get in the library. In an environment where there's people talking, there might be noise, just like in a real test, like, you can't really control your environment right? It won't always be like quiet, peaceful in your room. You might be in an environment that's a little bit loud, so maybe go out of your house to take it like in the library in an office building somewhere like that, and then take the practices again. Have someone else. Time you give like the 5 min breaks 588 01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:29.080 Jenny Duan: then see what you do from that. And then, after that. 589 01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:45.500 Jenny Duan: I'd like to see a copy of your school report, and then I think, after that what I would do is I would break down like the topics that you need the most help on. And then every like 30 min session just do like a focus review on one of those topics. For however many topics you'd need across like reading, writing, and math. 590 01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:54.769 Jenny Duan: and that should help to alleviate the knowledge gap, and then other than that, like on your own, you should be able to practice 1 HA day, and then from there, like 591 01:18:54.820 --> 01:19:18.779 Jenny Duan: use the answer explanations to your advantage, because every release practice test they have answers right? So look at the answers, and then from those answers they spend a lot of time understanding why every single question is wrong. Why? The correct answer is right? Because on that city there's only one correct answer. There's not multiple correct answers. And there's always going to be a reason why something is correct over",
    " the other. So understanding that will help you. And then, I think, just like 592 01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:25.640 Jenny Duan: increasing the number of practices you do, combined with the focus session should be able to help. But 593 01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:36.469 Jenny Duan: I think that definitely increasing 200 points is gonna be really challenging if I'm gonna be honest over the next 2 months. So that's why it's really important to understand. Like, if 594 01:19:36.570 --> 01:20:00.859 Jenny Duan: your baseline is like at 1,300, Ish, because I don't necessarily think that's true, because I think that in your practice test you've scored a lot higher. So I think just the next on the on your next practice. That's it'll be important to see like if this is a recurring trend for you, or if this test was out of an ordinary, so like trying to understand if if your high scores were out of the ordinary, or if this test was out of the ordinary. And then, like through that comparison, 595 01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:07.419 Jenny Duan: like giving an accurate baseline of what is realistically possible. Because again, the timeline is quite short. 596 01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:35.569 Ivy Mentors: Amazing, amazing. Yeah, I think you know, might be like a 30 day plan or 4 week plan, right that you're talking about. And I think just the way you have thought about it. I think it's something that I would also love to create. To be honest, because it's it's a very gen like, it's an important problem, and I can imagine that a lot of students might be doing this down the road as well. I'm sure a lot of people want to increase their score. And I probably think that it's it's it's a huge business out there. Probably lot of lot of people are actually doing that right. So I would love to understand 597 01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:39.360 Ivy Mentors: what's the right process in approaching. I think you've you've laid the next steps. 598 01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:47.060 Ivy Mentors: So, Houda, let's you know I",
    " would recommend you getting started. And maybe you can also record right like, first kind of just screen record your thing where 599 01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.850 Ivy Mentors: I think the whole idea is for you, Jenny to be able to really view? 600 01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:56.440 Ivy Mentors: How did she answer, how is she evaluating how she like, you know, I think that's critically important. Correct. 601 01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:25.829 Jenny Duan: yeah, definitely. But also but I wanna emphasize like you should not feel like like a sense that you can't do this like it's not impossible like this is just one score it will not impact with the rest of your life.

That's it'll be important to see like if this is a recurring trend for you, or if this test was out of an ordinary, so like trying to understand if if your high scores were out of the ordinary, or if this test was out of the ordinary. And then, like through that comparison, 595 like giving an accurate baseline of what is realistically possible. Because again, the timeline is quite short. 596"

I think it's something that I would also love to create. To be honest, because it's it's a very gen like, it's an important problem, and I can imagine that a lot of students might be doing this down the road as well. I'm sure a lot of people want to increase their score. And I probably think that it's it's it's a huge business out there. Probably lot of lot of people are actually doing that right. So I would love to understand 597 what's the right process in approaching. I think you've you've laid the next steps. 598"

But also but I wanna emphasize like you should not feel like like a sense that you can't do this like it's not impossible like this is just one score it will not impact with the rest of your life. Don't let this impact your mindset, because, like, obviously, you're very smart, you're capable of achieving high things like you shouldn't let this weigh down on you and affect like your practice, or anything, because, like, it's only this is only one test like, don't let it impact your mindset, because at the end of the day that's the most important thing. 602"

And 604 and also, I think. 605 I still need to look at, you know, a few checkpoints we had, and I think what we'll do is we'll just like add, we'll just extend to those sessions, you know, for for few more months. 606 and we'll just continue on. The other thing 607 sounds good, thank you. Cool, great. I think we we we had like us connect later this week, I mean on on the product. If you have time, we can do a 1 1 h connect, you know.
