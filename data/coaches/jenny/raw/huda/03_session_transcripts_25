I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well. I also want to give you a heads up that I'm in my room now, because the room downstairs is taken. So if the Wi-fi is acting up, let me know, and I'll sit in my roommates room which is like right there, just like I don't know if the Wi-fi is going to cooperate or not. So just let me know if it's gonna if it's like logging for you or something. Alright. 3 00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.730 Jenny Duan: But yeah, how's how's everything going? 4 00:01:45.510 --> 00:02:06.170 huda siraj: It's going well. So I did have like my calc test on Monday. And I think it went well. I think yeah, like the questions are pretty straightforward. So hopefully, I did well on the test, but I feel pretty confident right now. And then. Yeah, I think this week has just been kind of more chill. 5 00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.600 huda siraj: Let's go work at least. Gotcha. 6 00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.340 Jenny Duan: Well, I'm glad your test went. Well. I saw your new folklift like I saw your transition. 7 00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.620 Jenny Duan: Can you tell me about that like how you're transitioning the account. It looks good. 8 00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:41.230 huda siraj: Yeah, thank you. I think. So I did update like the website. So now, instead of just having like a page for like the businesses. I have like a new section like a new tab where we're gonna be putting like literature and like also just kind of like 9 00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:57.119 huda siraj: text from like Muslim youth. And I've already have, like a few people that replied to my story, interested again, specific, like, 5 people have been interested in writing something for folklift. So yeah, I think 10 00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:23.209 huda siraj: I'm pretty happy about that. But yeah, I'm trying to like kind of shift this so that people can like a lot of people. They wanna do something, but they don't. They can't write. So then they wanna make infographics. But I think that's like perfectly fine. So I could probably just like implement that my website. So right now, I have like 3 pieces of literature on my site. But yeah, I'm looking to go that soon. 11 00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:51.550 Jenny Duan: Oh, oops! I finally tried to unmute, but I turned off the camera. That's so awesome. And I think, like, another thing you can do is give people like a publication opportunity, you know, because people are always trying to like get their work published, or they they see it as sort of an award. So you can say, like, it's a publication opportunity for youth, or something like that, like, get a paper published, or get an article published, and I think that will also incentivize more people to contribute. And if you can say, like 12 00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.079 Jenny Duan: you have like a community blog. 13 00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:06.159 Jenny Duan: I think a good way to frame it could be like, you have a community blog with like I don't know, like 20 youth submissions, or like 100 submissions, or something that could be really cool, too. And you're like the person who's like managing that 14 00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:15.960 Jenny Duan: so I think that's awesome. Okay, so how's Let's see everything else we talked about pretty recently. So 15 00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:24.200 Jenny Duan: I think, let's just go. I want to spend some time looking at your essay questions. For your AI scholars. Application. 16 00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:42.570 huda siraj: yeah, I didn't really get a chance to fix the one with the color analogy. But I started writing the one about the anti-racist environment. And then I was also like fixing up a few things about the the video game? One. 17 00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.089 Jenny Duan: Sure. Yeah. Okay, maybe. Let's just start with this video game one 18 00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.270 Jenny Duan: I've made here. 19 00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.690 huda siraj: Sorry. 20 00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.709 Jenny Duan: Oh, I said, can you walk me through the changes that you've made with? 21 00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.729 huda siraj: Oh, yeah, so okay, I haven't. I wouldn't say like 22 00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:25.150 huda siraj: this is not how I want it to look like at the end. But yeah, let me just describe like what I've changed. So this sentence over here, I kind of implemented like the sentence structure that you provided. So I kinda talked about how symbolism kind of 23 00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:38.970 huda siraj: like in the game. It shows like a change in the actual world. So through the artistic depiction of gore, the game reveals realness, prevalence, and punishing nature of social flaws, or I think, should be societal 24 00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:50.050 huda siraj: societal flaws, such as capitalism and governmental corruption. And then I kind of elaborate it over here. 25 00:05:50.440 --> 00:06:03.629 huda siraj: The cartoonish, furry character is met with the real world. Further illustrating the connection between the issues presented in the game and issues in real life. I feel like this. This paraph might be a little kind of like the wording sounds a bit 26 00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.069 huda siraj: formal or formulaic. But yeah. And then, 27 00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.250 huda siraj: yeah, I started. I started writing this bet. I was like right before. 28 00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:32.389 huda siraj: So what pulled me into this game in specific is that it? It feels like a ghost. It felt like a ghost haunting me. In fact, when I had to complete my daily task of unloading, the dishwasher found myself think about when Loder got scared out of his mind, sing, and then I was gonna put 29 00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.499 huda siraj: this this specific dialogue quote. 30 00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:45.419 huda siraj: I was like kind of like that eerie part. And maybe I could go into like detail about like what this, what this line is like, 31 00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.580 huda siraj: right after. And 32 00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.020 huda siraj: yeah, I think II didn't really change much after that. Okay, cool. 33 00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:06.059 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that this is really good. I would be careful about ensuring that the reader knows that you're being intentional with the whore, and like the body whore and things like that, and not just 34 00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:15.570 Jenny Duan: that. You understand that it's not just like for sensationalization of the game. But it's to convey this purpose of the prevalence and punishing nature of societal flaws. So just trying to like 35 00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:37.219 Jenny Duan: sort of reinforce that you understand the thematic material behind the game, because chances are like this person. Well, the person reading your essay won't have played the game so like you to make sure they understand that it's it's the whore is different than like a random first person shooter game like call of duty. It's like something like more artistic and like more meaningful than just simply like 36 00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.360 huda siraj: being scary for the sake of being scary. Yeah. 37 00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.020 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. 38 00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.430 Jenny Duan: And then but 39 00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.250 huda siraj: I think you're lagging a little bit. 40 00:07:52.090 --> 00:08:01.999 Jenny Duan: Come back to this like on Saturday, when you have a more polished version of this. S, okay. okay, let me just move rooms. I think this is like kind of bothering. So it's gonna say, in here. 41 00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.360 Jenny Duan: okay. 42 00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.700 Jenny Duan: okay, can you? So 43 00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.040 Jenny Duan: but wait, I see that you worked on this one right? 44 00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:29.000 huda siraj: Yeah, a little bit like, yeah, II kinda I didn't make too much progress. But cause I didn't get to talk about like everything that I wanted to. But I think. I have like a good idea of what I'm gonna write about. How do you think you're doing? Structure? 45 00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:56.489 huda siraj: Okay? So here, I start with like the intro about like the Chat Gp story. So make an image of a computer programmer. Read the textbook as I typed out a prompt testing on my new chat. Gbt for sub subscription after seconds of a loading icon. There's there's a typical programmer with an upturn nose, light skinned blond hair and blue eyes. American attire. 46 00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.530 huda siraj: A white man coating away Gbt. 4 is a novelty, a new accessible wonder to the world. 47 00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:18.869 huda siraj: It was hard to imagine that in a diverse field of computer science pro computer programmers, the strongest AI returns to stereotypical and eurocentric representation. And then, II think after this paragraph, I was gonna talk more about like 48 00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:45.980 huda siraj: like specific examples. I was actually searching up like some like examples of AI like bias in real world. And I was gonna talk about how during during quarantine? They would proctor tests, and they do face detection, and they wouldn't detect black faces and it was just kind of this like. 49 00:09:46.150 --> 00:10:08.490 huda siraj: like destroying or destructive to the black community. And it often got them in like situations that they didn't deserve to be in and it needs to be prevented with AI ethics. And I'll kind of like talk about empowering AI and like and stuff. I don't think actually, I think it's kind of more worth knowing 50 00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.109 huda siraj: like noting 51 00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:25.520 huda siraj: since Thoria, then empowering. I like, I know, some empowering us is important, but I feel like Cynthia kinda emphasizes AI ethics more so like, or like at least making it more accessible. So I think I'm gonna talk about that more and 52 00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.430 huda siraj: and then 53 00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.529 huda siraj: and then I talk about in the hackathon 54 00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.829 huda siraj: where, like my all female team, like we were kind of felt 55 00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:43.490 huda siraj: different from everyone else, because most of the people there were not. Okay. I would. I kinda 56 00:10:43.750 --> 00:11:03.650 huda siraj: tweaked the truth over here. But it was just a man in general. Yeah, it wasn't white men, but it was just like men. so yeah. And then I think I kinda elaborate more on, why, that needs to be changed and like, why, it's important to do that. I think I could probably bring in like the 57 00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.819 huda siraj: Bank of America essay on like how it brings new perspectives. 58 00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:23.370 huda siraj: and yeah, I think. oh, I guess. I think we talked about last time about talking. Why, like AI ethics is a kind of more of an apology than like 59 00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:28.369 huda siraj: a procedure, to begin with so maybe I could end it off with that. 60 00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.610 Jenny Duan: That sounds really good to me. I think this framework is like. 61 00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.689 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think it's good 62 00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.790 Jenny Duan: I don't really have any issues with this. I'm excited to see where it goes. Do you have any concerns about this essay? 63 00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.620 huda siraj: No. 64 00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:53.729 huda siraj: Do you think like so far. Do you think like the flow is fine, cause I feel like I feel like this paragraph is a bit like it just jumps from another topic. 65 00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.070 Jenny Duan: Or do you think it's fine? I personally think it's fine? 66 00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.080 Jenny Duan: yeah, I don't. I don't think there's any issues with it. 67 00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.430 huda siraj: Okay. 68 00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.480 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Let's go to the next one. 69 00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.649 Jenny Duan: This one. Have you changed this essay at all? 70 00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.670 huda siraj: No. 71 00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.660 Jenny Duan: okay, this is fine. 72 00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:30.409 Jenny Duan: And then what if? And you said, you haven't gotten a chance to edit this one? Okay, that's totally fine. What are you thinking about? When it comes to framing this. I feel like this. One doesn't really need much framing. I feel like this can just be like 73 00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.909 Jenny Duan: a more straightforward one. But 74 00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.979 Jenny Duan: curious to know what your thoughts are. 75 00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.559 huda siraj: I think this one's a bit like more 76 00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:44.269 huda siraj: hard for me, cause II don't really like writing straightforward essays, but I think 77 00:12:44.620 --> 00:13:02.590 huda siraj: I could probably see I don't like just like straight out, say, like, Oh, Mount House, doesn't have any resources, and like start off with that I so like I don't exactly know how to frame it without it just sounding too generic 78 00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.960 Jenny Duan: with me 79 00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.369 Jenny Duan: that makes sense. 80 00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.260 Jenny Duan: so are you trying to frame it in a different way then. And if so, what way? 81 00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:16.589 huda siraj: I was probably gonna think I was. I mean, I was probably gonna say like 82 00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:43.289 huda siraj: Well, I was thinking, maybe I could describe like a setting at Simi, like maybe like the like how the campus looks. And then I could be like and then I could describe, like, maybe students, there are interested in engine or like, there's them students there. There's also liberal arts there, which is much like me, where I'd fit in and at pre college I'll be able to actually 83 00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:49.799 huda siraj: experience this and I'll be able to connect with and like, just go through all the bullet points. 84 00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.370 huda siraj: And then I could probably use, like the same 85 00:13:53.370 --> 00:14:04.359 huda siraj: passionate and innovative environment is a major ship. My rural town kind of say the same thing, but maybe like without the color analogy. Yeah. So like 86 00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:20.580 huda siraj: kind of that way. But I don't know if, like the the campus setting, like as like a intro is like too much or like overdone. So yeah, well, how do you imagine like the campus setting taking place in this in this essay like, how do you imagine framing that 87 00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:37.620 huda siraj: like? I think I was searching like images of Cmu. And then I know there's like like the main building, or like the one that's like most well known, is like like kind of like a square, but like with like a rectangle, and like a dome on it. But like, 88 00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:45.989 huda siraj: yeah, like yeah, the loop on it. And so I was gonna describe the shape, maybe, and then I could be like 89 00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.789 huda siraj: sitting in the like the park. I see like students passing me by 90 00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:12.770 huda siraj: from different majors from stem stem. Related technology related classes all the way to humanity, humanities and liberal arts. Which reminds me of myself. Who's a blend of the 2? 91 00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.440 huda siraj: I actually think that seems really good like. 92 00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:23.130 Jenny Duan: because I think ultimately, like you want them to see you on campus. I think you're freezing again. Oh, no, I think. 93 00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.729 Jenny Duan: Is this better? Or am I still frozen? 94 00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:33.910 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, it's fine now. Oh, yeah, I've been. I think that one of the goals is they like you want them to see you on campus so like 95 00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:45.959 Jenny Duan: like they want to see you as a student at Cmu, either in the Pre College or just in their normal college. I guess so. As if you can give them that image of yourself like by physically describing your location, then that should be like great. 96 00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:52.599 Jenny Duan: I don't see any issues with that. Okay, then that seems good. Do you have any other questions about this one. 97 00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:02.920 huda siraj: so okay, wait. For the intro. I still kind of wanted to elaborate like. So 98 00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.309 huda siraj: when you say to like describe myself on campus like 99 00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:15.260 huda siraj: Maybe I can say like how I'd be there with the students who are from like the different majors or 100 00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:25.440 huda siraj: like. I don't know if that's too much, because I'm not at Cmu yet, but like or should I say, like I imagine myself walking with the students. 101 00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:34.250 huda siraj: backpack in hand, heading off to a liberal arts or tech class. 102 00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.870 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could say like, I see myself 103 00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.740 Jenny Duan: like, surrounded by a group of diverse peers 104 00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.830 Jenny Duan: who are interested in like math sense, like the literature and culture, and like things like me, or something like that. 105 00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.929 huda siraj: And so you can. Maybe you don't get to see like students. But you can say, like. 106 00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:10.410 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like scholar students. But they don't have to be Cmu students, right? Because at the Pre College. People from all over the world like Come in or all over the country, come in and do the programs so like you don't necessarily have to say, like Cmu students, you can just say, like other scholars 107 00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.839 huda siraj: from like different high schools, too, does that make sense? 108 00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.390 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome? Does this as a make sense to you. Do you have any other questions about this one? 109 00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.150 huda siraj: Yeah, I think I've cleared it up 110 00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:32.519 Jenny Duan: alright. Cool? Okay, I think we're doing actually really good on essays. I wanted to check in just briefly about everything else. First, is there anything top of mind that you want to go over. 111 00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.340 Jenny Duan: But 112 00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:53.970 huda siraj: oh, yeah, so for folklift. So I know. I'm like kind of shifting from like, just like promoting small businesses. So like I was considering whether I should kind of limit it to like Muslim youth, or should I just like open it up for for, like 113 00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:06.580 huda siraj: all youth like diversity cause because, like I've been advertising it like I think I've I've just advertised it as like open to all posting like 114 00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:17.929 huda siraj: supporters and like Muslims, Muslim youth. And yeah, I was just wondering, like, Would I just keep it for Muslim youth issues? 115 00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:39.220 Jenny Duan: I think. Okay, we can trace it back to like, wait how you want this to appear, I think, like on your activity section, right? So what you have right now is, you have journalism and storytelling as one thing that you're passionate about. Within that I think you have the opportunity to make it as broad or as narrow as you want, as long as you are able to like. 116 00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:45.519 Jenny Duan: increase your impact the most. So, while I do think it is valuable to have something targeted towards Muslim youth. 117 00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:55.339 Jenny Duan: I don't think that's necessary if I think the goal should be to like maximize. Your impact in like the number of stories, number of shares, number of submissions, because I think the way that you can frame it is 118 00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:03.649 Jenny Duan: can be whatever you want, because even if you don't necessarily only focus on Muslim youth. You can say, like you built a platform that like highlights mislead stories. 119 00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:23.109 Jenny Duan: And even if that's not like the purpose, if that's not even if that's not the only thing that your platform focuses on. Like. If you do that, you can just call it like a platform that empowers Muslim. You right? So like, if you need to show that for a scholarship, for example, let's say you're applying for like a Muslim use scholarship, then you can like highlight. That aspect of the project. But 120 00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:28.300 Jenny Duan: like that doesn't mean that you have to make your entire project about that. 121 00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.260 Jenny Duan: So I think that you can make it broader, because, honestly like. 122 00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.140 Jenny Duan: you can frame it in whatever way you want, you just need to generate the most impact possible. 123 00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:47.860 Jenny Duan: So whatever you think will cause. Well, the other thing is, if it's too broad, then you might be like losing focus, and like people might not see a point of connecting with your platform. But 124 00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.959 Jenny Duan: I think wherever you see the balance between getting enough viewers, but also 125 00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.770 Jenny Duan: being specific enough that, like people are so interested in it. That's fine. 126 00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:09.179 huda siraj: You don't have to just do muscle youth. Yeah, I think maybe I think I'm gonna go with just like limited to youth, but 127 00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:21.590 huda siraj: like any issue like in the like societal flaws, basically to talk about it. And kind of like report. So yeah, I think youth. Journalism will be like the main focus, I guess. 128 00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.810 Jenny Duan: Let me try to see like another similar. This is a pretty similar like 129 00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.789 Jenny Duan: youth, the non profit that my friend did. 130 00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.950 Jenny Duan: you can kind of see, like. 131 00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:40.679 Jenny Duan: okay, she's working with, you know, different organizations, partners and supporters about programs. 132 00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.380 Jenny Duan: Cultural discovery camps, past programs. 133 00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.390 Jenny Duan: News. Let's see. Okay, blog 134 00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.560 Jenny Duan: of 135 00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.210 Jenny Duan: contact. 136 00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:12.019 Jenny Duan: I think it'd be nice to get like a domain for your project, if that's possible. Like, just like folklift.com, or like the folklift.com or folklift, or whatever I think, full flip, org, or something could be valuable. Just so you don't have to continuously host it from your 137 00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.959 huda siraj: I forget what it's called. Yeah. 138 00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.739 Jenny Duan: yeah, that platform. 139 00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:21.830 Jenny Duan: So I think it shouldn't be too expensive to get a domain. I don't think 140 00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.190 huda siraj: yeah. 141 00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.080 Jenny Duan: So I would do that if you can. 142 00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.590 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Anything. Any questions about anything else? 143 00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.080 huda siraj: Mmm. 144 00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.640 huda siraj: I think. 145 00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:53.040 huda siraj: I think we're actually doing good on like the few tracks we have on? yeah, I need. I need to ask for the recommendations for the for the 146 00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.210 huda siraj: Cmu program. So I'll probably do that tomorrow. 147 00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool for grip tape. Did you get a chance to ref film yours? 148 00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:12.030 huda siraj: Oh, yeah, I did. I just edit. Let me go get let me send it to you. Actually, okay. Or if you wanted to share your screen, that could also work right now. 149 00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:42.819 huda siraj: I also feel like it's like a lot more casual. I don't know if it's too casual. But yeah. 150 00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.539 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine, if it's casual. I don't think that should be a concern 151 00:22:47.050 --> 00:23:27.769 huda siraj: okay. and my name is hoda, Suraj, and 152 00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.550 Jenny Duan: it's okay. 153 00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:47.660 huda siraj: oh, gosh, I don't know where it went. 154 00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.510 huda siraj: And we're just gonna send it to our cell phone messages. 155 00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.739 Jenny Duan: Yeah, no problem. 156 00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.240 huda siraj: Okay? 157 00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:32.070 huda siraj: Why can you see him on the screen. Oh, wait, no, I need to stop sharing before. Okay, there we go. 158 00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.289 Jenny Duan: Go for it. Yeah, I can see it. 159 00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.349 Jenny Duan: Are you sure you sound? I don't think I can hear your sound. 160 00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.780 huda siraj: Oh, 161 00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.610 huda siraj: How 162 00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.799 huda siraj: I don't know how to. 163 00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.450 Oh, okay, I got it. 164 00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.630 huda siraj: Oh. 165 00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.189 huda siraj: gosh! I don't know how to do this. 166 00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.140 Jenny Duan: It's okay. 167 00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.130 huda siraj: Okay. 168 00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:58.669 huda siraj: Hi, my name is Heather Sarash, and this is my application for cryptape. So I live in Mountain House, and it's this rural town. It's not even considered a town in Norcow and we don't own any stores, any malls or anything, so I think the biggest landmark we have is safeway, which is saying a lot. We kind of just end up buying everything from small businesses. I have family friends and relatives 169 00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:16.779 that own small businesses, and they sell Biryani, which is a cultural dish or Ramadan crafts, but they don't have quite the audience and reach that other small businesses do. And so I wanted to target this disparity with a nonprofit called folklift. And essentially 170 00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:43.249 huda siraj: I wanted to fuse, infuse my passion for filmmaking and cinematography, which but I didn't really think I could create change with it until I knew that I could do something about this. So decided, I wanted to create video advertisements and and opportunities for these small Muslim owned businesses in my community through these advertisements. And there was one caveat which was that 171 00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:53.899 I don't own a camera or any equipment. So I kind of just had to end up writing articles and and don't get me wrong. My writing skills aren't the worst, but 172 00:26:54.110 --> 00:27:23.179 I felt like the impact I was able to make was definitely being limited by this lack of resource and ask that I'd be given this opportunity to get a learning challenge where I can interview a local small Muslim business. I'd ask some questions like, what made you start your business. What are the struggles of being a Muslim owned business? Why do you keep continuing like? What's your motive? What's your motivation? 173 00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:50.210 And these are kind of important questions that everyone's everyone wants to tell their story about. But I just don't think it gets told enough. And I just want this to be more available in the world. And so in this learning challenge, II really hope to target more and more small Muslim-owned businesses in my area and in specific. The camera. That, I believe, is best, for my mission is a sony, a 6,400. 174 00:27:50.380 --> 00:28:01.969 The reason is, it would be perfect for product shots, interview shots and and just genuinely everything. I think it's a perfect camera camera for this mission. And yeah. And 175 00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:15.229 I really wanted to thank you all for this gracious opportunity and this learning challenge with group tape, because I wouldn't be the only grateful one it would be. Every single Muslim owned business in my area. 176 00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.529 Thank you. 177 00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.660 Jenny Duan: No, I think this is so much better. I really like this. 178 00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:34.669 Jenny Duan: I don't think it sounds too casual at all. I think it comes out very heartfelt and genuine. And I think this is like, I think it's this, the story is very clear. So I really like this, I think this is ready for submission. 179 00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:43.430 Jenny Duan: yeah. I think. since they're ready to submit, II don't really see any issues with that. So that's looking good to me. 180 00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:51.469 Jenny Duan: Okay. Then the next thing. I don't think we can do a full check in. Is there anything new with everything else. 181 00:28:53.510 --> 00:29:10.110 huda siraj: like filmmakers. Club empowering. AI. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Oh, no! It's we started editing for Filmmakers Club. Yeah, we haven't finished it. 182 00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:17.230 huda siraj: Oh, obviously. But oh, yeah, we started editing it. And then, oh, yeah, about the interview. 183 00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:36.419 huda siraj: I actually did not get to do it, because it was like at that time he cancelled, and he was kind of busy. And then he said, the next time he's available is gonna be next month. So I guess that's a bit sad, but it's fine. And then 184 00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:52.689 huda siraj: I also reached out to a games for good, podcast and I email them, some of them about my game and asking like, if we could like talk a little bit and kind of told them about how 185 00:29:52.800 --> 00:30:02.020 huda siraj: like. Well, my game is for. And I want to spread education about them. So yeah, I'm hoping they could get back to me about that. 186 00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:08.439 huda siraj: yes. yeah. And the women in games. 187 00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:19.980 huda siraj: The discord I have I like reached out to one of them. But with the moderators. They're like, not exactly active. So I'll I'll probably get a response like maybe tomorrow or something. 188 00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.420 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! Awesome. 189 00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.959 Jenny Duan: That sounds all like that. All sounds like good progress to me. 190 00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:33.230 Jenny Duan: In school in general. Do you think you're on track to get straight? A's? Do you need any support like, how is school going? 191 00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.609 huda siraj: Yeah, I think 192 00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:45.570 huda siraj: for, like most of my classes, I have a's right now. Or like not most like all of them right now. 193 00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.500 huda siraj: But 194 00:30:47.510 --> 00:31:01.680 huda siraj: yeah, I think I need to like I remember how like hard it was last semester to maintain that. A. So I think I'm definitely gonna like, start putting more time into a push than my other classes. So yeah, I think 195 00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:20.499 huda siraj: to keep this a is like, really important this semester. I somehow it was able to get a last semester. But I think I need to try harder for this semester. It's definitely harder. We're having like, like essays and test every single week. So it's kind of bad. 196 00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.360 huda siraj: Yeah. 197 00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.000 Jenny Duan: wow. And then 198 00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.429 Jenny Duan: for the SAT studying, how is that going? 199 00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:41.959 huda siraj: Yeah. So I think, my dad, like he found someone through your contacts. And he it's like we're setting up like a time to like meet and I think we're gonna do 200 00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:56.359 huda siraj: Thursdays and Saturdays and ask me like 90 min sessions and we're gonna like, talk about like he's gonna like, teach me strategies. And like, answer practice questions. 201 00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:12.459 huda siraj: And yeah, definitely, I've been doing my Khan Academy like every day. Cause like I got the app, and then I've been doing it for lessons for meeting and specific cause. I know that's like the part which is struggling the most. So. 202 00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:19.399 huda siraj: yeah, I've been like doing that kind of practice and the practice test. I didn't like I did 203 00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:26.100 huda siraj: the one of them, and I got a 1480. So, yeah, alright awesome. So. 204 00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.830 Jenny Duan: okay, do you know who we are working with? You know their name? 205 00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:37.380 huda siraj: Yeah, I think his name is Stephen Stephen. Oh, cool! Have you met him? Oh, no, I haven't talked him yet. 206 00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:46.980 Jenny Duan: anyway. Stephen's one of my friends. I know he's super smart, like he did like math competitions and stuff in high school, and I'm glad that he's working with you. Let me know how that goes. 207 00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:59.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I don't know exactly what he's like as a tutor, but I know he works with like a lot of students or not a lot. But like he's worked with a lot of students in the past. And he's super smart. So hopefully, that goes well. 208 00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:03.730 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm curious to see like how the 209 00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.790 Jenny Duan: how the 210 00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:21.079 huda siraj: digital SAT format goes, because I just don't know how like challenging that will be compared to the paper exam, but yeah, so for the practices, at least like it was really different from like the actual SAT, like the paper SAT, because 211 00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:31.039 huda siraj: the reading section was completely different, have, like a bunch of paragraphs. And then we had to read it, for, like one paragraph for each set of like each question and 212 00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:37.779 huda siraj: like. I think it was honestly kind of easier and like 213 00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:53.049 huda siraj: I feel like the math section as well like you could solve everything on like the the calculator that it provides you. So I think it's definitely gonna be easier than that paper step. But II definitely need a study for this new format. 214 00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.919 huda siraj: Oh, yeah. And I also got like the Prep. 215 00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.940 Jenny Duan: How sorry you froze. You also ought to practice what 216 00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.960 huda siraj: I go to practice books. So I've been like working on the pages daily. And yeah. 217 00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.519 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. That's really good to hear. 218 00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:26.420 Jenny Duan: Great. So now I'm thinking we can take some time and take a look at this application cause it's due March first, which you know. It's crazy that March first. It's like only one month away. 219 00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:32.099 Jenny Duan: even though it seems like so far away. It's only one month. But 220 00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.199 Jenny Duan: I think this is a good program for you. 221 00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:49.579 Jenny Duan: it's a 2 week journalism camp. So if you got into like other programs, you would still be able to do this one hopefully cause it's only 2 weeks lost, not the whole summer. So yeah, but I think it'd be really good, because it's a really prestigious camp. It's all 222 00:34:49.940 --> 00:35:01.010 Jenny Duan: It's all free pay for everything, and like airfare, campus, housing, and meals, and you'll get to meet a lot of cool journalism students, and like the networking and the 223 00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:20.630 Jenny Duan: longevity of this program is quite good, like, they have a lot of really cool alumni and stuff like that who are working in professional journalism fields. So I think it would be good to ask for your letter of recommendation really early. So think this is something we can start thinking about for journalism. Do you have any idea of who you would want to ask for a letter of recommendation? 224 00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:22.830 huda siraj: Hmm! 225 00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:52.019 huda siraj: I think. My Cs teacher, she's been like. Her recommendations have been like pretty strong lately. So cause she's the same one who got me the Nc. Where award and the department awards, so I feel like I can trust her for this one and another like non stamp teacher, like maybe English, because I think the subject of this like, if you have someone who could talk about your experience with film or communication, I think that might be more powerful. 226 00:35:53.250 --> 00:36:10.330 huda siraj: so, my English teacher, she. She's kind of selective with the recommendations she does. Yeah. So I might, I could ask my media arts feature. But I'm also asking for the Cmu recommendations. So 227 00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:16.779 huda siraj: why don't you ask your Cs teacher to write you for the Cmu and your media? Sorry you for this one. 228 00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:24.699 huda siraj: II think, for Cmu. It requires, too. So I was gonna ask Miss like my Cs teacher, anyway. 229 00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.960 Jenny Duan: Alright 230 00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.200 Jenny Duan: Do you think your media art teacher would write you a good one for this one. 231 00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:46.950 huda siraj: Not really cause like so last time for the Bank of America recommendation, like he wasn't able to like submit it so that I have to submit it like the Pdf. And I kinda read like what he wrote. And it's a really generic. 232 00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.740 huda siraj: And then he actually like. 233 00:36:49.890 --> 00:37:06.199 Jenny Duan: wrote he, instead of she on part of it. So I don't know if I trust him with this. Okay, okay, so let's not. Let's not ask him. 234 00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:12.530 huda siraj: What about is he the one who moderates film Club? No, we have like 235 00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:23.730 huda siraj: there was like an advisor. She was like our advisor for a couple of years. She's a good another Cs teacher, but we don't really collaborate with her, so let me 236 00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.860 huda siraj: think. 237 00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:26.409 Jenny Duan: Does she know you are 238 00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.550 huda siraj: not really. 239 00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.339 Jenny Duan: but any other teachers. 240 00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:44.690 huda siraj: I think I can. I can try asking my Apis teacher. I've had her for 2 years, and like we do write like essays and such in that class. So like maybe she'd be able to talk about that. 241 00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:57.770 Jenny Duan: Can you make an account here. And let's just I wanna see the guidelines for letter of recommendation to see if it has to be a teacher. Or maybe it could be a community member, maybe could be like a mentor. Maybe it could be something else. So 242 00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.130 Jenny Duan: let's just look at what they require. 243 00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.560 Jenny Duan: So there are 3 short answer questions. 244 00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.420 Jenny Duan: And there are. 245 00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.279 huda siraj: there are 75 word or less. 246 00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:26.890 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's like pretty short. And then 3 essays, which are like one's, 1, 50 words, ones, 2 50 words, and one's 1 50 words 247 00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.479 Jenny Duan: when they ever say optional always do the optional. 248 00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:17.690 huda siraj: okay, I'm gonna share my screen. 249 00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.020 Jenny Duan: Alright. Go ahead. 250 00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.090 huda siraj: Okay, I think II filled out this like 251 00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:48.430 Jenny Duan: information. I think your screen's like frozen for me. 252 00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.000 Nope. 253 00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.470 Jenny Duan: Oh, there you go. Okay, cool. 254 00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:55.570 huda siraj: Oh. 255 00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.590 huda siraj: okay. 256 00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:31.550 Jenny Duan: okay. Teachers, advisors, or counselors. You can also be the editor of a local paper station or publication. 257 00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.289 Jenny Duan: Okay, so who can speak to your journalistic or academic abilities. 258 00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:48.839 huda siraj: I feel like like of my teachers. 259 00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.310 huda siraj: Oh, like I feel like the only person that would be willing to do it 260 00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.639 huda siraj: or like, be able to tell it, would be my 261 00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:16.929 huda siraj: us history teacher, or I can. So last year I had this like video production teacher, she's different from the teacher right now. But she like moved away. But like she was my teacher and she really like liked my filmmaking skills. And she, 262 00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:31.149 huda siraj: was like really supportive. And like. She also emailed me like recent like, not recently, but like during the summer telling me I should like apply to some festival, so maybe I can reach out to her and ask her about this. I'd do her. Yes. 263 00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.759 Jenny Duan: you can reach out to her, saying, you want to catch up 264 00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:44.659 Jenny Duan: and say like, Give her some updates and tell her like about your life and tell her, like you won the film festival thing that she told you to do. Are you going on? Number mentioned? Right? And then 265 00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:51.459 Jenny Duan: Then, at the end of your call, your Zoom call to Ketchup mentioned that you're applying for this. And you're wondering if she can write you a load of recommendation. 266 00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:53.100 huda siraj: Okay? 267 00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.260 Jenny Duan: Think that's like the strategy. 268 00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:56.940 huda siraj: Yeah. 269 00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.040 huda siraj: she's really nice, like, she's actually like a phone maker herself. So 270 00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.140 huda siraj: oh, cool. Yeah. 271 00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:06.000 Jenny Duan: She moved away. Where? 272 00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:12.829 huda siraj: I think like la like, she just started like making movies in the actual industry. So it's really cool. 273 00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:22.250 Jenny Duan: So cool. Yeah, okay, that sounds perfect. Let's take a look at the short essay questions. And let's start brainstorming like a couple of them while we have time. Today. 274 00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.880 huda siraj: Okay, I'm getting to know you. 275 00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, video introduction. I feel like that one you can just 276 00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.749 Jenny Duan: do like. 277 00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:35.569 Jenny Duan: Briefly, yeah. 278 00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:43.330 Jenny Duan: introduce yourself. You can say, like, you're hooda. You're from Mountainhouse, California, and explain 279 00:42:43.390 --> 00:43:12.569 Jenny Duan: why you want to do this camp and like what you're interested in. So I think anything that I talk about our first Muslim women. Not a lot of representation in media and journalism. Second mount has pretty like remote area, without a lot of access to like large news stations. You want more exposure to expand the impact of your storytelling talk about folklore empowering AI, your film club stuff like that, what you're involved in and talk about your aspirations for the future. So I know you don't really want to be a journalist. But just say, like, you want to be a journalist 280 00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:20.310 Jenny Duan: for the purposes of this program. or you don't want to say you want to be a journalist, but you can say like you are committed to like 281 00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.070 Jenny Duan: sharing stories in your future in like some way. 282 00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.200 huda siraj: And you could say, that's like through like 283 00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:33.589 Jenny Duan: storytelling or through like podcasting or like. However, you want to keep sharing stories in an authentic way to you like, keep on talking about that 284 00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:43.339 Jenny Duan: like you don't have to say like, I wanna be a sports broadcaster. But you can say, like, I wanna continue to uplift like diverse or underrepresented stories in my media, or something like that. 285 00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:50.619 huda siraj: So is this a kind of like again, like a little? Is it kind of like casual or like a script to kind of thing? 286 00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:56.339 Jenny Duan: I think so. Have the outline, but don't have the script. Does that make sense? 287 00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:05.910 Jenny Duan: So have an outline of things you want to talk about, but go for it naturally, because I think when you have a script it sounds a little bit too robotic in that it doesn't sound genuine anymore. When you script it 288 00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.570 huda siraj: okay 289 00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.529 Jenny Duan: and then okay, 290 00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.169 Jenny Duan: why do you want to attend jcamp this summer? 291 00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:20.539 Jenny Duan: this one, you can whip up a story about like under representation in media, like, why, you wanted to 292 00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.400 Jenny Duan: do folklift or something like that. 293 00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.659 huda siraj: I'm just gonna write it down. So remember, yeah. 294 00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:37.980 Jenny Duan: and then talk about like the specifics details of the program. So what about the program inspires you? Is it being able to collaborate with other students. Is it learning from the speakers? Write specifically about the program? 295 00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:43.529 Jenny Duan: Because again, they want to see you at the program. And they want to see like, why you are good fit with the program. 296 00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:56.419 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think, like for these, why do you want to? I feel like you've got it in check like you've written a lot of these already. So just whip up a version of that and put it here. We're able to spend a month reporting on any issue. What would it be? 297 00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:07.960 huda siraj: This one? I think you just answer genuinely like, what are you right now? I'm most interested in? I think I think that right about Polysene, and I'm like, if 298 00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:24.039 huda siraj: we had to like, who would I speak to? There's like this really famous like press from from Palestine, and his name is Mokoz, and like he has, like a really inspiring story, and like I probably would talk about like 299 00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:30.539 huda siraj: interviewing him, and like kind of talking, exposing like his 300 00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:41.999 Jenny Duan: journey with the world. I guess this would be good. I would also look at like journalistic principles like, I think there's like a journalism code of ethics and talk about like how journalism is really powerful, like, emphasize like. 301 00:45:42.000 --> 00:46:05.329 Jenny Duan: what is it about journalism like that draws you in like? Is it the ability to dissent? Is it the ability to speak truth to power, like, what about journalism like? What about the values of journalism really resonates with you? I think that would be like a good thing like maybe, like speaking truth to power, or like exposing issues that, like people, are free to talk about or educating the public and and things like that, like 302 00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:10.120 Jenny Duan: some of the higher values of journalism, and bringing that out as like a broader theme of this essay 303 00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.710 huda siraj: okay 304 00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:18.210 Jenny Duan: and you can find this in the journalism code of ethics and like the purpose of journalism and things like that on line. 305 00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:29.299 Jenny Duan: Alright, that sounds good. And and then talk about this one. You can hammer in like under representation and media, and how you want to bring out diverse voices. Talk about your own background here. 306 00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.409 huda siraj: Oh, maybe over here like. 307 00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.899 huda siraj: do you think it's like 308 00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:45.929 huda siraj: if I talk about like, maybe, like Disney movies like like, they don't have any South Asian or Muslim like characters. So like. 309 00:46:45.940 --> 00:47:03.819 Jenny Duan: do you think that's like really considered journalism or like, is that a whole different thing? I think that's a little different cause. That's media. I mean, you could talk about how media in general, it doesn't have representation. But, like internalism, like, there's not a lot of like. Okay, maybe you should emphasize what aspect of journalism you're most interested in. So 310 00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:10.489 Jenny Duan: look at the website. Let me just look at this website. this jcamp thing and see like what they teach. 311 00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:21.389 Jenny Duan: they produce multi platform news packages. let's see what they do. 312 00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.819 Jenny Duan: Broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, photojournalism, or online media. 313 00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:40.490 Jenny Duan: So figure out what section of journalism you're most interested in, and then write about that. So like, you can say, like, in talking about something specific that relates to, I think for you, broadcasting or online media might be the most relevant to you 314 00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:57.490 Jenny Duan: involved in newspaper, magazine or photojour journalism. So talk about how like, maybe in broadcasting only like x percent of broadcasters are like Muslim women or whatever, and how that's under represented. And even in online media, like the stories that we read, which directly influence the way that we perceive the world is primarily dominated by like 315 00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.130 Jenny Duan: the most basic narratives. 316 00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:19.260 huda siraj: maybe, so, I had an idea for this one, maybe I could talk about like so for a like specific example, it was like a time on like this, like a news. Like kind of channel. By Pierce Morgan, where like 317 00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:32.840 huda siraj: all the Muslim speakers that like come to show like I feel like he there's like definitely like lots of clips of him, like shutting them up, or like kinda like erasing their narrative. So like, maybe I could talk about that as 318 00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:42.260 huda siraj: like kind of like under representation. How like censorship is like a big big, like, kind of impact in the world. 319 00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.999 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, that sounds great. 320 00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.010 Jenny Duan: Think that's a good idea. 321 00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:52.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool any other questions. 322 00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.770 huda siraj: That's all. For now I think these ones you could probably talk about later. 323 00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:16.829 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So on Saturday, I think the goal should be to finish the Cmu application and then try to get your letters of Rex asked for, and then later, the next time we meet we can on Saturday. If we have, if you get the chance. We can also talk about the rest of the Jake camp essays. If you have a chance to draft any of them or brainstorm any of the other ones. 324 00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.350 huda siraj: Yeah. Sounds good. 325 00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.640 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool, then take care. Oh, wait! Actually, one thing 326 00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:31.690 Jenny Duan: on Saturday. I'm wondering if we can bump our meeting a little bit earlier. If that's possible. If not, that's okay, too. But if you were able to do it at like 327 00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:44.170 Jenny Duan: we actually no, it actually doesn't conflict with something. Never mind on on Saturday, or something from 8 to 11. But I forgot that our meetings are earlier on Saturday, so it doesn't actually come back. 328 00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.290 huda siraj: Oh, wait. When are her Saturday meetings? 329 00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:56.150 Jenny Duan: Okay, 8, 45. Wait, no, we actually do need to bump it. Yeah, earlier, if you're free anytime earlier in the day. 330 00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.840 huda siraj: maybe like 331 00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.330 huda siraj: word of 5, if that's why. 332 00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:08.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah. For do you want to do? 4, 15 to 5. Or do you want to do like after that? What time? 333 00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:29.209 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think 4, 15 to 5 sounds good, I think, like cause. I also have, like the sat meeting. At 7 or 6. Yeah. 6. Okay. Cool. Then sounds good. I will see you. 4, 15 on Saturday I'll ask to get that meeting moved. Thank you so much for being flexible. 334 00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:32.339 huda siraj: Bye. Thank you. Bye.",

I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well. I also want to give you a heads up that I'm in my room now, because the room downstairs is taken. So if the Wi-fi is acting up, let me know, and I'll sit in my roommates room which is like right there, just like I don't know if the Wi-fi is going to cooperate or not. So just let me know if it's gonna if it's like logging for you or something. Alright. 3 00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.730 Jenny Duan: But yeah, how's how's everything going? 4 00:01:45.510 --> 00:02:06.170 huda siraj: It's going well. So I did have like my calc test on Monday. And I think it went well. I think yeah, like the questions are pretty straightforward. So hopefully, I did well on the test, but I feel pretty confident right now. And then. Yeah, I think this week has just been kind of more chill. 5 00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.600 huda siraj: Let's go work at least. Gotcha. 6 00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.340 Jenny Duan: Well, I'm glad your test went. Well. I saw your new folklift like I saw your transition. 7 00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.620 Jenny Duan: Can you tell me about that like how you're transitioning the account. It looks good. 8 00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:41.230 huda siraj: Yeah, thank you. I think. So I did update like the website. So now, instead of just having like a page for like the businesses. I have like a new section like a new tab where we're gonna be putting like literature and like also just kind of like 9 00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:57.119 huda siraj: text from like Muslim youth. And I've already have, like a few people that replied to my story, interested again, specific, like, 5 people have been interested in writing something for folklift. So yeah, I think 10 00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:23.209 huda siraj: I'm pretty happy about that. But yeah, I'm trying",
    " to like kind of shift this so that people can like a lot of people. They wanna do something, but they don't. They can't write. So then they wanna make infographics. But I think that's like perfectly fine. So I could probably just like implement that my website. So right now, I have like 3 pieces of literature on my site. But yeah, I'm looking to go that soon. 11 00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:51.550 Jenny Duan: Oh, oops! I finally tried to unmute, but I turned off the camera. That's so awesome. And I think, like, another thing you can do is give people like a publication opportunity, you know, because people are always trying to like get their work published, or they they see it as sort of an award. So you can say, like, it's a publication opportunity for youth, or something like that, like, get a paper published, or get an article published, and I think that will also incentivize more people to contribute. And if you can say, like 12 00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.079 Jenny Duan: you have like a community blog. 13 00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:06.159 Jenny Duan: I think a good way to frame it could be like, you have a community blog with like I don't know, like 20 youth submissions, or like 100 submissions, or something that could be really cool, too. And you're like the person who's like managing that 14 00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:15.960 Jenny Duan: so I think that's awesome. Okay, so how's Let's see everything else we talked about pretty recently. So 15 00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:24.200 Jenny Duan: I think, let's just go. I want to spend some time looking at your essay questions. For your AI scholars. Application. 16 00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:42.570 huda siraj: yeah, I didn't really get a chance to fix the one with the color analogy. But I started writing the one about the anti-racist environment. And then I was also like fixing up a few things about the the video game? One. 17 00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.089 Jenny Duan: Sure. Yeah. Okay, maybe. Let's just start with this video game one 18 00:0",
    "4:53.190 --> 00:04:54.270 Jenny Duan: I've made here. 19 00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.690 huda siraj: Sorry. 20 00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.709 Jenny Duan: Oh, I said, can you walk me through the changes that you've made with? 21 00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.729 huda siraj: Oh, yeah, so okay, I haven't. I wouldn't say like 22 00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:25.150 huda siraj: this is not how I want it to look like at the end. But yeah, let me just describe like what I've changed. So this sentence over here, I kind of implemented like the sentence structure that you provided. So I kinda talked about how symbolism kind of 23 00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:38.970 huda siraj: like in the game. It shows like a change in the actual world. So through the artistic depiction of gore, the game reveals realness, prevalence, and punishing nature of social flaws, or I think, should be societal 24 00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:50.050 huda siraj: societal flaws, such as capitalism and governmental corruption. And then I kind of elaborate it over here. 25 00:05:50.440 --> 00:06:03.629 huda siraj: The cartoonish, furry character is met with the real world. Further illustrating the connection between the issues presented in the game and issues in real life. I feel like this. This paraph might be a little kind of like the wording sounds a bit 26 00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.069 huda siraj: formal or formulaic. But yeah. And then, 27 00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.250 huda siraj: yeah, I started. I started writing this bet. I was like right before. 28 00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:32.389 huda siraj: So what pulled me into this game in specific is that it? It feels like a ghost. It felt like a ghost haunting me. In fact, when I had to complete my daily task of unloading, the dishwasher found myself think about when Loder got scared out of his mind, sing, and then I was gonna put 29 00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.499 huda siraj: this this specific dialogue quote. 30 00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:45.419 huda siraj: I was like kind of like that ee",
    "rie part. And maybe I could go into like detail about like what this, what this line is like, 31 00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.580 huda siraj: right after. And 32 00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.020 huda siraj: yeah, I think II didn't really change much after that. Okay, cool. 33 00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:06.059 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that this is really good. I would be careful about ensuring that the reader knows that you're being intentional with the whore, and like the body whore and things like that, and not just 34 00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:15.570 Jenny Duan: that. You understand that it's not just like for sensationalization of the game. But it's to convey this purpose of the prevalence and punishing nature of societal flaws. So just trying to like 35 00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:37.219 Jenny Duan: sort of reinforce that you understand the thematic material behind the game, because chances are like this person. Well, the person reading your essay won't have played the game so like you to make sure they understand that it's it's the whore is different than like a random first person shooter game like call of duty. It's like something like more artistic and like more meaningful than just simply like 36 00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.360 huda siraj: being scary for the sake of being scary. Yeah. 37 00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.020 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. 38 00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.430 Jenny Duan: And then but 39 00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.250 huda siraj: I think you're lagging a little bit. 40 00:07:52.090 --> 00:08:01.999 Jenny Duan: Come back to this like on Saturday, when you have a more polished version of this. S, okay. okay, let me just move rooms. I think this is like kind of bothering. So it's gonna say, in here. 41 00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.360 Jenny Duan: okay. 42 00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.700 Jenny Duan: okay, can you? So 43 00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.040 Jenny Duan: but wait, I see that you worked on this one right? 44 00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:29.000 huda siraj: Yeah, a littl",
    "e bit like, yeah, II kinda I didn't make too much progress. But cause I didn't get to talk about like everything that I wanted to. But I think. I have like a good idea of what I'm gonna write about. How do you think you're doing? Structure? 45 00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:56.489 huda siraj: Okay? So here, I start with like the intro about like the Chat Gp story. So make an image of a computer programmer. Read the textbook as I typed out a prompt testing on my new chat. Gbt for sub subscription after seconds of a loading icon. There's there's a typical programmer with an upturn nose, light skinned blond hair and blue eyes. American attire. 46 00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.530 huda siraj: A white man coating away Gbt. 4 is a novelty, a new accessible wonder to the world. 47 00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:18.869 huda siraj: It was hard to imagine that in a diverse field of computer science pro computer programmers, the strongest AI returns to stereotypical and eurocentric representation. And then, II think after this paragraph, I was gonna talk more about like 48 00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:45.980 huda siraj: like specific examples. I was actually searching up like some like examples of AI like bias in real world. And I was gonna talk about how during during quarantine? They would proctor tests, and they do face detection, and they wouldn't detect black faces and it was just kind of this like. 49 00:09:46.150 --> 00:10:08.490 huda siraj: like destroying or destructive to the black community. And it often got them in like situations that they didn't deserve to be in and it needs to be prevented with AI ethics. And I'll kind of like talk about empowering AI and like and stuff. I don't think actually, I think it's kind of more worth knowing 50 00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.109 huda siraj: like noting 51 00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:25.520 huda siraj: since Thoria, then empowering. I like, I know, some empowering us is important, but I feel like Cynthia kinda emphasizes AI ethics more so like, or like at ",
    "least making it more accessible. So I think I'm gonna talk about that more and 52 00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.430 huda siraj: and then 53 00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.529 huda siraj: and then I talk about in the hackathon 54 00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.829 huda siraj: where, like my all female team, like we were kind of felt 55 00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:43.490 huda siraj: different from everyone else, because most of the people there were not. Okay. I would. I kinda 56 00:10:43.750 --> 00:11:03.650 huda siraj: tweaked the truth over here. But it was just a man in general. Yeah, it wasn't white men, but it was just like men. so yeah. And then I think I kinda elaborate more on, why, that needs to be changed and like, why, it's important to do that. I think I could probably bring in like the 57 00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.819 huda siraj: Bank of America essay on like how it brings new perspectives. 58 00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:23.370 huda siraj: and yeah, I think. oh, I guess. I think we talked about last time about talking. Why, like AI ethics is a kind of more of an apology than like 59 00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:28.369 huda siraj: a procedure, to begin with so maybe I could end it off with that. 60 00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.610 Jenny Duan: That sounds really good to me. I think this framework is like. 61 00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.689 Jenny Duan: yeah, I think it's good 62 00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.790 Jenny Duan: I don't really have any issues with this. I'm excited to see where it goes. Do you have any concerns about this essay? 63 00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.620 huda siraj: No. 64 00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:53.729 huda siraj: Do you think like so far. Do you think like the flow is fine, cause I feel like I feel like this paragraph is a bit like it just jumps from another topic. 65 00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.070 Jenny Duan: Or do you think it's fine? I personally think it's fine? 66 00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.080 Jenny Duan: yeah, I don't. I don't think there's any issues with it. 67 00:12:0",
    "2.310 --> 00:12:03.430 huda siraj: Okay. 68 00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.480 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. Let's go to the next one. 69 00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.649 Jenny Duan: This one. Have you changed this essay at all? 70 00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.670 huda siraj: No. 71 00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.660 Jenny Duan: okay, this is fine. 72 00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:30.409 Jenny Duan: And then what if? And you said, you haven't gotten a chance to edit this one? Okay, that's totally fine. What are you thinking about? When it comes to framing this. I feel like this. One doesn't really need much framing. I feel like this can just be like 73 00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.909 Jenny Duan: a more straightforward one. But 74 00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.979 Jenny Duan: curious to know what your thoughts are. 75 00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.559 huda siraj: I think this one's a bit like more 76 00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:44.269 huda siraj: hard for me, cause II don't really like writing straightforward essays, but I think 77 00:12:44.620 --> 00:13:02.590 huda siraj: I could probably see I don't like just like straight out, say, like, Oh, Mount House, doesn't have any resources, and like start off with that I so like I don't exactly know how to frame it without it just sounding too generic 78 00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.960 Jenny Duan: with me 79 00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.369 Jenny Duan: that makes sense. 80 00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.260 Jenny Duan: so are you trying to frame it in a different way then. And if so, what way? 81 00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:16.589 huda siraj: I was probably gonna think I was. I mean, I was probably gonna say like 82 00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:43.289 huda siraj: Well, I was thinking, maybe I could describe like a setting at Simi, like maybe like the like how the campus looks. And then I could be like and then I could describe, like, maybe students, there are interested in engine or like, there's them students there. There's also liberal arts there, which is much like me, where I'd fit ",
    "in and at pre college I'll be able to actually 83 00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:49.799 huda siraj: experience this and I'll be able to connect with and like, just go through all the bullet points. 84 00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.370 huda siraj: And then I could probably use, like the same 85 00:13:53.370 --> 00:14:04.359 huda siraj: passionate and innovative environment is a major ship. My rural town kind of say the same thing, but maybe like without the color analogy. Yeah. So like 86 00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:20.580 huda siraj: kind of that way. But I don't know if, like the the campus setting, like as like a intro is like too much or like overdone. So yeah, well, how do you imagine like the campus setting taking place in this in this essay like, how do you imagine framing that 87 00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:37.620 huda siraj: like? I think I was searching like images of Cmu. And then I know there's like like the main building, or like the one that's like most well known, is like like kind of like a square, but like with like a rectangle, and like a dome on it. But like, 88 00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:45.989 huda siraj: yeah, like yeah, the loop on it. And so I was gonna describe the shape, maybe, and then I could be like 89 00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.789 huda siraj: sitting in the like the park. I see like students passing me by 90 00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:12.770 huda siraj: from different majors from stem stem. Related technology related classes all the way to humanity, humanities and liberal arts. Which reminds me of myself. Who's a blend of the 2? 91 00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.440 huda siraj: I actually think that seems really good like. 92 00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:23.130 Jenny Duan: because I think ultimately, like you want them to see you on campus. I think you're freezing again. Oh, no, I think. 93 00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.729 Jenny Duan: Is this better? Or am I still frozen? 94 00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:33.910 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah, it's fine now. Oh, yeah, I've been. I think that one of",
    " the goals is they like you want them to see you on campus so like 95 00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:45.959 Jenny Duan: like they want to see you as a student at Cmu, either in the Pre College or just in their normal college. I guess so. As if you can give them that image of yourself like by physically describing your location, then that should be like great. 96 00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:52.599 Jenny Duan: I don't see any issues with that. Okay, then that seems good. Do you have any other questions about this one. 97 00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:02.920 huda siraj: so okay, wait. For the intro. I still kind of wanted to elaborate like. So 98 00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.309 huda siraj: when you say to like describe myself on campus like 99 00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:15.260 huda siraj: Maybe I can say like how I'd be there with the students who are from like the different majors or 100 00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:25.440 huda siraj: like. I don't know if that's too much, because I'm not at Cmu yet, but like or should I say, like I imagine myself walking with the students. 101 00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:34.250 huda siraj: backpack in hand, heading off to a liberal arts or tech class. 102 00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.870 Jenny Duan: Maybe you could say like, I see myself 103 00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.740 Jenny Duan: like, surrounded by a group of diverse peers 104 00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.830 Jenny Duan: who are interested in like math sense, like the literature and culture, and like things like me, or something like that. 105 00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.929 huda siraj: And so you can. Maybe you don't get to see like students. But you can say, like. 106 00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:10.410 Jenny Duan: Yeah, like scholar students. But they don't have to be Cmu students, right? Because at the Pre College. People from all over the world like Come in or all over the country, come in and do the programs so like you don't necessarily have to say, like Cmu students, you can just say, like other scholars 107 00:17:10.480 ",
    "--> 00:17:13.839 huda siraj: from like different high schools, too, does that make sense? 108 00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.390 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome? Does this as a make sense to you. Do you have any other questions about this one? 109 00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.150 huda siraj: Yeah, I think I've cleared it up 110 00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:32.519 Jenny Duan: alright. Cool? Okay, I think we're doing actually really good on essays. I wanted to check in just briefly about everything else. First, is there anything top of mind that you want to go over. 111 00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.340 Jenny Duan: But 112 00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:53.970 huda siraj: oh, yeah, so for folklift. So I know. I'm like kind of shifting from like, just like promoting small businesses. So like I was considering whether I should kind of limit it to like Muslim youth, or should I just like open it up for for, like 113 00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:06.580 huda siraj: all youth like diversity cause because, like I've been advertising it like I think I've I've just advertised it as like open to all posting like 114 00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:17.929 huda siraj: supporters and like Muslims, Muslim youth. And yeah, I was just wondering, like, Would I just keep it for Muslim youth issues? 115 00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:39.220 Jenny Duan: I think. Okay, we can trace it back to like, wait how you want this to appear, I think, like on your activity section, right? So what you have right now is, you have journalism and storytelling as one thing that you're passionate about. Within that I think you have the opportunity to make it as broad or as narrow as you want, as long as you are able to like. 116 00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:45.519 Jenny Duan: increase your impact the most. So, while I do think it is valuable to have something targeted towards Muslim youth. 117 00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:55.339 Jenny Duan: I don't think that's necessary if I think the goal should be to like maximize. Your impact in like the number of stories, number of ",
    "shares, number of submissions, because I think the way that you can frame it is 118 00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:03.649 Jenny Duan: can be whatever you want, because even if you don't necessarily only focus on Muslim youth. You can say, like you built a platform that like highlights mislead stories. 119 00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:23.109 Jenny Duan: And even if that's not like the purpose, if that's not even if that's not the only thing that your platform focuses on. Like. If you do that, you can just call it like a platform that empowers Muslim. You right? So like, if you need to show that for a scholarship, for example, let's say you're applying for like a Muslim use scholarship, then you can like highlight. That aspect of the project. But 120 00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:28.300 Jenny Duan: like that doesn't mean that you have to make your entire project about that. 121 00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.260 Jenny Duan: So I think that you can make it broader, because, honestly like. 122 00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.140 Jenny Duan: you can frame it in whatever way you want, you just need to generate the most impact possible. 123 00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:47.860 Jenny Duan: So whatever you think will cause. Well, the other thing is, if it's too broad, then you might be like losing focus, and like people might not see a point of connecting with your platform. But 124 00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.959 Jenny Duan: I think wherever you see the balance between getting enough viewers, but also 125 00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.770 Jenny Duan: being specific enough that, like people are so interested in it. That's fine. 126 00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:09.179 huda siraj: You don't have to just do muscle youth. Yeah, I think maybe I think I'm gonna go with just like limited to youth, but 127 00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:21.590 huda siraj: like any issue like in the like societal flaws, basically to talk about it. And kind of like report. So yeah, I think youth. Journalism will be like the main focus, I guess. 128 00:20:22.5",
    "40 --> 00:20:26.810 Jenny Duan: Let me try to see like another similar. This is a pretty similar like 129 00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.789 Jenny Duan: youth, the non profit that my friend did. 130 00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.950 Jenny Duan: you can kind of see, like. 131 00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:40.679 Jenny Duan: okay, she's working with, you know, different organizations, partners and supporters about programs. 132 00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.380 Jenny Duan: Cultural discovery camps, past programs. 133 00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.390 Jenny Duan: News. Let's see. Okay, blog 134 00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.560 Jenny Duan: of 135 00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.210 Jenny Duan: contact. 136 00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:12.019 Jenny Duan: I think it'd be nice to get like a domain for your project, if that's possible. Like, just like folklift.com, or like the folklift.com or folklift, or whatever I think, full flip, org, or something could be valuable. Just so you don't have to continuously host it from your 137 00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.959 huda siraj: I forget what it's called. Yeah. 138 00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.739 Jenny Duan: yeah, that platform. 139 00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:21.830 Jenny Duan: So I think it shouldn't be too expensive to get a domain. I don't think 140 00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.190 huda siraj: yeah. 141 00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.080 Jenny Duan: So I would do that if you can. 142 00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.590 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Anything. Any questions about anything else? 143 00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.080 huda siraj: Mmm. 144 00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.640 huda siraj: I think. 145 00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:53.040 huda siraj: I think we're actually doing good on like the few tracks we have on? yeah, I need. I need to ask for the recommendations for the for the 146 00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.210 huda siraj: Cmu program. So I'll probably do that tomorrow. 147 00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.140 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool for grip tape. Did you get a chance to ref film yours? 148 00:22:03.1",
    "60 --> 00:22:12.030 huda siraj: Oh, yeah, I did. I just edit. Let me go get let me send it to you. Actually, okay. Or if you wanted to share your screen, that could also work right now. 149 00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:42.819 huda siraj: I also feel like it's like a lot more casual. I don't know if it's too casual. But yeah. 150 00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.539 Jenny Duan: I think it's fine, if it's casual. I don't think that should be a concern 151 00:22:47.050 --> 00:23:27.769 huda siraj: okay. and my name is hoda, Suraj, and 152 00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.550 Jenny Duan: it's okay. 153 00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:47.660 huda siraj: oh, gosh, I don't know where it went. 154 00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.510 huda siraj: And we're just gonna send it to our cell phone messages. 155 00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.739 Jenny Duan: Yeah, no problem. 156 00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.240 huda siraj: Okay? 157 00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:32.070 huda siraj: Why can you see him on the screen. Oh, wait, no, I need to stop sharing before. Okay, there we go. 158 00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.289 Jenny Duan: Go for it. Yeah, I can see it. 159 00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.349 Jenny Duan: Are you sure you sound? I don't think I can hear your sound. 160 00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.780 huda siraj: Oh, 161 00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.610 huda siraj: How 162 00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.799 huda siraj: I don't know how to. 163 00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.450 Oh, okay, I got it. 164 00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.630 huda siraj: Oh. 165 00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.189 huda siraj: gosh! I don't know how to do this. 166 00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.140 Jenny Duan: It's okay. 167 00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.130 huda siraj: Okay. 168 00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:58.669 huda siraj: Hi, my name is Heather Sarash, and this is my application for cryptape. So I live in Mountain House, and it's this rural town. It's not even considered a town in Norcow and we don't own any stores, any malls or anything, so I think the biggest landmark we have is safeway, which ",
    "is saying a lot. We kind of just end up buying everything from small businesses. I have family friends and relatives 169 00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:16.779 that own small businesses, and they sell Biryani, which is a cultural dish or Ramadan crafts, but they don't have quite the audience and reach that other small businesses do. And so I wanted to target this disparity with a nonprofit called folklift. And essentially 170 00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:43.249 huda siraj: I wanted to fuse, infuse my passion for filmmaking and cinematography, which but I didn't really think I could create change with it until I knew that I could do something about this. So decided, I wanted to create video advertisements and and opportunities for these small Muslim owned businesses in my community through these advertisements. And there was one caveat which was that 171 00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:53.899 I don't own a camera or any equipment. So I kind of just had to end up writing articles and and don't get me wrong. My writing skills aren't the worst, but 172 00:26:54.110 --> 00:27:23.179 I felt like the impact I was able to make was definitely being limited by this lack of resource and ask that I'd be given this opportunity to get a learning challenge where I can interview a local small Muslim business. I'd ask some questions like, what made you start your business. What are the struggles of being a Muslim owned business? Why do you keep continuing like? What's your motive? What's your motivation? 173 00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:50.210 And these are kind of important questions that everyone's everyone wants to tell their story about. But I just don't think it gets told enough. And I just want this to be more available in the world. And so in this learning challenge, II really hope to target more and more small Muslim-owned businesses in my area and in specific. The camera. That, I believe, is best, for my mission is a sony, a 6,400. 174 00:27:50.380 --> 00:28:01.969 The reason is, it would be perfect for",
    " product shots, interview shots and and just genuinely everything. I think it's a perfect camera camera for this mission. And yeah. And 175 00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:15.229 I really wanted to thank you all for this gracious opportunity and this learning challenge with group tape, because I wouldn't be the only grateful one it would be. Every single Muslim owned business in my area. 176 00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.529 Thank you. 177 00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.660 Jenny Duan: No, I think this is so much better. I really like this. 178 00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:34.669 Jenny Duan: I don't think it sounds too casual at all. I think it comes out very heartfelt and genuine. And I think this is like, I think it's this, the story is very clear. So I really like this, I think this is ready for submission. 179 00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:43.430 Jenny Duan: yeah. I think. since they're ready to submit, II don't really see any issues with that. So that's looking good to me. 180 00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:51.469 Jenny Duan: Okay. Then the next thing. I don't think we can do a full check in. Is there anything new with everything else. 181 00:28:53.510 --> 00:29:10.110 huda siraj: like filmmakers. Club empowering. AI. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Oh, no! It's we started editing for Filmmakers Club. Yeah, we haven't finished it. 182 00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:17.230 huda siraj: Oh, obviously. But oh, yeah, we started editing it. And then, oh, yeah, about the interview. 183 00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:36.419 huda siraj: I actually did not get to do it, because it was like at that time he cancelled, and he was kind of busy. And then he said, the next time he's available is gonna be next month. So I guess that's a bit sad, but it's fine. And then 184 00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:52.689 huda siraj: I also reached out to a games for good, podcast and I email them, some of them about my game and asking like, if we could like talk a little bit and kind of told them about how 185 00:29:52.800 --> 00:30:02.020 huda siraj: like. Wel",
    "l, my game is for. And I want to spread education about them. So yeah, I'm hoping they could get back to me about that. 186 00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:08.439 huda siraj: yes. yeah. And the women in games. 187 00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:19.980 huda siraj: The discord I have I like reached out to one of them. But with the moderators. They're like, not exactly active. So I'll I'll probably get a response like maybe tomorrow or something. 188 00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.420 Jenny Duan: Oh, wait! Awesome. 189 00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.959 Jenny Duan: That sounds all like that. All sounds like good progress to me. 190 00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:33.230 Jenny Duan: In school in general. Do you think you're on track to get straight? A's? Do you need any support like, how is school going? 191 00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.609 huda siraj: Yeah, I think 192 00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:45.570 huda siraj: for, like most of my classes, I have a's right now. Or like not most like all of them right now. 193 00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.500 huda siraj: But 194 00:30:47.510 --> 00:31:01.680 huda siraj: yeah, I think I need to like I remember how like hard it was last semester to maintain that. A. So I think I'm definitely gonna like, start putting more time into a push than my other classes. So yeah, I think 195 00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:20.499 huda siraj: to keep this a is like, really important this semester. I somehow it was able to get a last semester. But I think I need to try harder for this semester. It's definitely harder. We're having like, like essays and test every single week. So it's kind of bad. 196 00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.360 huda siraj: Yeah. 197 00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.000 Jenny Duan: wow. And then 198 00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.429 Jenny Duan: for the SAT studying, how is that going? 199 00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:41.959 huda siraj: Yeah. So I think, my dad, like he found someone through your contacts. And he it's like we're setting up like a time to like meet and I think we're gonna do 200 00:31",
    ":42.340 --> 00:31:56.359 huda siraj: Thursdays and Saturdays and ask me like 90 min sessions and we're gonna like, talk about like he's gonna like, teach me strategies. And like, answer practice questions. 201 00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:12.459 huda siraj: And yeah, definitely, I've been doing my Khan Academy like every day. Cause like I got the app, and then I've been doing it for lessons for meeting and specific cause. I know that's like the part which is struggling the most. So. 202 00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:19.399 huda siraj: yeah, I've been like doing that kind of practice and the practice test. I didn't like I did 203 00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:26.100 huda siraj: the one of them, and I got a 1480. So, yeah, alright awesome. So. 204 00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.830 Jenny Duan: okay, do you know who we are working with? You know their name? 205 00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:37.380 huda siraj: Yeah, I think his name is Stephen Stephen. Oh, cool! Have you met him? Oh, no, I haven't talked him yet. 206 00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:46.980 Jenny Duan: anyway. Stephen's one of my friends. I know he's super smart, like he did like math competitions and stuff in high school, and I'm glad that he's working with you. Let me know how that goes. 207 00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:59.770 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I don't know exactly what he's like as a tutor, but I know he works with like a lot of students or not a lot. But like he's worked with a lot of students in the past. And he's super smart. So hopefully, that goes well. 208 00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:03.730 Jenny Duan: yeah, I'm curious to see like how the 209 00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.790 Jenny Duan: how the 210 00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:21.079 huda siraj: digital SAT format goes, because I just don't know how like challenging that will be compared to the paper exam, but yeah, so for the practices, at least like it was really different from like the actual SAT, like the paper SAT, because 211 00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:31.039 huda siraj: the reading section was complete",
    "ly different, have, like a bunch of paragraphs. And then we had to read it, for, like one paragraph for each set of like each question and 212 00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:37.779 huda siraj: like. I think it was honestly kind of easier and like 213 00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:53.049 huda siraj: I feel like the math section as well like you could solve everything on like the the calculator that it provides you. So I think it's definitely gonna be easier than that paper step. But II definitely need a study for this new format. 214 00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.919 huda siraj: Oh, yeah. And I also got like the Prep. 215 00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.940 Jenny Duan: How sorry you froze. You also ought to practice what 216 00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.960 huda siraj: I go to practice books. So I've been like working on the pages daily. And yeah. 217 00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.519 Jenny Duan: okay, awesome. That's really good to hear. 218 00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:26.420 Jenny Duan: Great. So now I'm thinking we can take some time and take a look at this application cause it's due March first, which you know. It's crazy that March first. It's like only one month away. 219 00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:32.099 Jenny Duan: even though it seems like so far away. It's only one month. But 220 00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.199 Jenny Duan: I think this is a good program for you. 221 00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:49.579 Jenny Duan: it's a 2 week journalism camp. So if you got into like other programs, you would still be able to do this one hopefully cause it's only 2 weeks lost, not the whole summer. So yeah, but I think it'd be really good, because it's a really prestigious camp. It's all 222 00:34:49.940 --> 00:35:01.010 Jenny Duan: It's all free pay for everything, and like airfare, campus, housing, and meals, and you'll get to meet a lot of cool journalism students, and like the networking and the 223 00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:20.630 Jenny Duan: longevity of this program is quite good, like, they have a lot of really cool ",
    "alumni and stuff like that who are working in professional journalism fields. So I think it would be good to ask for your letter of recommendation really early. So think this is something we can start thinking about for journalism. Do you have any idea of who you would want to ask for a letter of recommendation? 224 00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:22.830 huda siraj: Hmm! 225 00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:52.019 huda siraj: I think. My Cs teacher, she's been like. Her recommendations have been like pretty strong lately. So cause she's the same one who got me the Nc. Where award and the department awards, so I feel like I can trust her for this one and another like non stamp teacher, like maybe English, because I think the subject of this like, if you have someone who could talk about your experience with film or communication, I think that might be more powerful. 226 00:35:53.250 --> 00:36:10.330 huda siraj: so, my English teacher, she. She's kind of selective with the recommendations she does. Yeah. So I might, I could ask my media arts feature. But I'm also asking for the Cmu recommendations. So 227 00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:16.779 huda siraj: why don't you ask your Cs teacher to write you for the Cmu and your media? Sorry you for this one. 228 00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:24.699 huda siraj: II think, for Cmu. It requires, too. So I was gonna ask Miss like my Cs teacher, anyway. 229 00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.960 Jenny Duan: Alright 230 00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.200 Jenny Duan: Do you think your media art teacher would write you a good one for this one. 231 00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:46.950 huda siraj: Not really cause like so last time for the Bank of America recommendation, like he wasn't able to like submit it so that I have to submit it like the Pdf. And I kinda read like what he wrote. And it's a really generic. 232 00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.740 huda siraj: And then he actually like. 233 00:36:49.890 --> 00:37:06.199 Jenny Duan: wrote he, instead of she on part of it. So I don't know if I ",
    "trust him with this. Okay, okay, so let's not. Let's not ask him. 234 00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:12.530 huda siraj: What about is he the one who moderates film Club? No, we have like 235 00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:23.730 huda siraj: there was like an advisor. She was like our advisor for a couple of years. She's a good another Cs teacher, but we don't really collaborate with her, so let me 236 00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.860 huda siraj: think. 237 00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:26.409 Jenny Duan: Does she know you are 238 00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.550 huda siraj: not really. 239 00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.339 Jenny Duan: but any other teachers. 240 00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:44.690 huda siraj: I think I can. I can try asking my Apis teacher. I've had her for 2 years, and like we do write like essays and such in that class. So like maybe she'd be able to talk about that. 241 00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:57.770 Jenny Duan: Can you make an account here. And let's just I wanna see the guidelines for letter of recommendation to see if it has to be a teacher. Or maybe it could be a community member, maybe could be like a mentor. Maybe it could be something else. So 242 00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.130 Jenny Duan: let's just look at what they require. 243 00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.560 Jenny Duan: So there are 3 short answer questions. 244 00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.420 Jenny Duan: And there are. 245 00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.279 huda siraj: there are 75 word or less. 246 00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:26.890 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that's like pretty short. And then 3 essays, which are like one's, 1, 50 words, ones, 2 50 words, and one's 1 50 words 247 00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.479 Jenny Duan: when they ever say optional always do the optional. 248 00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:17.690 huda siraj: okay, I'm gonna share my screen. 249 00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.020 Jenny Duan: Alright. Go ahead. 250 00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.090 huda siraj: Okay, I think II filled out this like 251 00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:48.430 Jenny Duan: infor",
    "mation. I think your screen's like frozen for me. 252 00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.000 Nope. 253 00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.470 Jenny Duan: Oh, there you go. Okay, cool. 254 00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:55.570 huda siraj: Oh. 255 00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.590 huda siraj: okay. 256 00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:31.550 Jenny Duan: okay. Teachers, advisors, or counselors. You can also be the editor of a local paper station or publication. 257 00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.289 Jenny Duan: Okay, so who can speak to your journalistic or academic abilities. 258 00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:48.839 huda siraj: I feel like like of my teachers. 259 00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.310 huda siraj: Oh, like I feel like the only person that would be willing to do it 260 00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.639 huda siraj: or like, be able to tell it, would be my 261 00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:16.929 huda siraj: us history teacher, or I can. So last year I had this like video production teacher, she's different from the teacher right now. But she like moved away. But like she was my teacher and she really like liked my filmmaking skills. And she, 262 00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:31.149 huda siraj: was like really supportive. And like. She also emailed me like recent like, not recently, but like during the summer telling me I should like apply to some festival, so maybe I can reach out to her and ask her about this. I'd do her. Yes. 263 00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.759 Jenny Duan: you can reach out to her, saying, you want to catch up 264 00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:44.659 Jenny Duan: and say like, Give her some updates and tell her like about your life and tell her, like you won the film festival thing that she told you to do. Are you going on? Number mentioned? Right? And then 265 00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:51.459 Jenny Duan: Then, at the end of your call, your Zoom call to Ketchup mentioned that you're applying for this. And you're wondering if she can write you a load of recommendation. 266 00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:53.100 huda siraj: Okay? 267 0",
    "0:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.260 Jenny Duan: Think that's like the strategy. 268 00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:56.940 huda siraj: Yeah. 269 00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.040 huda siraj: she's really nice, like, she's actually like a phone maker herself. So 270 00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.140 huda siraj: oh, cool. Yeah. 271 00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:06.000 Jenny Duan: She moved away. Where? 272 00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:12.829 huda siraj: I think like la like, she just started like making movies in the actual industry. So it's really cool. 273 00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:22.250 Jenny Duan: So cool. Yeah, okay, that sounds perfect. Let's take a look at the short essay questions. And let's start brainstorming like a couple of them while we have time. Today. 274 00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.880 huda siraj: Okay, I'm getting to know you. 275 00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.239 Jenny Duan: Okay, video introduction. I feel like that one you can just 276 00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.749 Jenny Duan: do like. 277 00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:35.569 Jenny Duan: Briefly, yeah. 278 00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:43.330 Jenny Duan: introduce yourself. You can say, like, you're hooda. You're from Mountainhouse, California, and explain 279 00:42:43.390 --> 00:43:12.569 Jenny Duan: why you want to do this camp and like what you're interested in. So I think anything that I talk about our first Muslim women. Not a lot of representation in media and journalism. Second mount has pretty like remote area, without a lot of access to like large news stations. You want more exposure to expand the impact of your storytelling talk about folklore empowering AI, your film club stuff like that, what you're involved in and talk about your aspirations for the future. So I know you don't really want to be a journalist. But just say, like, you want to be a journalist 280 00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:20.310 Jenny Duan: for the purposes of this program. or you don't want to say you want to be a journalist, but you can say like you are committed to like 281 00:4",
    "3:20.360 --> 00:43:24.070 Jenny Duan: sharing stories in your future in like some way. 282 00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.200 huda siraj: And you could say, that's like through like 283 00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:33.589 Jenny Duan: storytelling or through like podcasting or like. However, you want to keep sharing stories in an authentic way to you like, keep on talking about that 284 00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:43.339 Jenny Duan: like you don't have to say like, I wanna be a sports broadcaster. But you can say, like, I wanna continue to uplift like diverse or underrepresented stories in my media, or something like that. 285 00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:50.619 huda siraj: So is this a kind of like again, like a little? Is it kind of like casual or like a script to kind of thing? 286 00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:56.339 Jenny Duan: I think so. Have the outline, but don't have the script. Does that make sense? 287 00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:05.910 Jenny Duan: So have an outline of things you want to talk about, but go for it naturally, because I think when you have a script it sounds a little bit too robotic in that it doesn't sound genuine anymore. When you script it 288 00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.570 huda siraj: okay 289 00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.529 Jenny Duan: and then okay, 290 00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.169 Jenny Duan: why do you want to attend jcamp this summer? 291 00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:20.539 Jenny Duan: this one, you can whip up a story about like under representation in media, like, why, you wanted to 292 00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.400 Jenny Duan: do folklift or something like that. 293 00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.659 huda siraj: I'm just gonna write it down. So remember, yeah. 294 00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:37.980 Jenny Duan: and then talk about like the specifics details of the program. So what about the program inspires you? Is it being able to collaborate with other students. Is it learning from the speakers? Write specifically about the program? 295 00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:43.529 Jenny Duan: ",
    "Because again, they want to see you at the program. And they want to see like, why you are good fit with the program. 296 00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:56.419 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think, like for these, why do you want to? I feel like you've got it in check like you've written a lot of these already. So just whip up a version of that and put it here. We're able to spend a month reporting on any issue. What would it be? 297 00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:07.960 huda siraj: This one? I think you just answer genuinely like, what are you right now? I'm most interested in? I think I think that right about Polysene, and I'm like, if 298 00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:24.039 huda siraj: we had to like, who would I speak to? There's like this really famous like press from from Palestine, and his name is Mokoz, and like he has, like a really inspiring story, and like I probably would talk about like 299 00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:30.539 huda siraj: interviewing him, and like kind of talking, exposing like his 300 00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:41.999 Jenny Duan: journey with the world. I guess this would be good. I would also look at like journalistic principles like, I think there's like a journalism code of ethics and talk about like how journalism is really powerful, like, emphasize like. 301 00:45:42.000 --> 00:46:05.329 Jenny Duan: what is it about journalism like that draws you in like? Is it the ability to dissent? Is it the ability to speak truth to power, like, what about journalism like? What about the values of journalism really resonates with you? I think that would be like a good thing like maybe, like speaking truth to power, or like exposing issues that, like people, are free to talk about or educating the public and and things like that, like 302 00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:10.120 Jenny Duan: some of the higher values of journalism, and bringing that out as like a broader theme of this essay 303 00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.710 huda siraj: okay 304 00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:18.210 Jenny Duan: and you can ",
    "find this in the journalism code of ethics and like the purpose of journalism and things like that on line. 305 00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:29.299 Jenny Duan: Alright, that sounds good. And and then talk about this one. You can hammer in like under representation and media, and how you want to bring out diverse voices. Talk about your own background here. 306 00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.409 huda siraj: Oh, maybe over here like. 307 00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.899 huda siraj: do you think it's like 308 00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:45.929 huda siraj: if I talk about like, maybe, like Disney movies like like, they don't have any South Asian or Muslim like characters. So like. 309 00:46:45.940 --> 00:47:03.819 Jenny Duan: do you think that's like really considered journalism or like, is that a whole different thing? I think that's a little different cause. That's media. I mean, you could talk about how media in general, it doesn't have representation. But, like internalism, like, there's not a lot of like. Okay, maybe you should emphasize what aspect of journalism you're most interested in. So 310 00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:10.489 Jenny Duan: look at the website. Let me just look at this website. this jcamp thing and see like what they teach. 311 00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:21.389 Jenny Duan: they produce multi platform news packages. let's see what they do. 312 00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.819 Jenny Duan: Broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, photojournalism, or online media. 313 00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:40.490 Jenny Duan: So figure out what section of journalism you're most interested in, and then write about that. So like, you can say, like, in talking about something specific that relates to, I think for you, broadcasting or online media might be the most relevant to you 314 00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:57.490 Jenny Duan: involved in newspaper, magazine or photojour journalism. So talk about how like, maybe in broadcasting only like x percent of broadcasters are like Muslim women or whatever, and how th",
    "at's under represented. And even in online media, like the stories that we read, which directly influence the way that we perceive the world is primarily dominated by like 315 00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.130 Jenny Duan: the most basic narratives. 316 00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:19.260 huda siraj: maybe, so, I had an idea for this one, maybe I could talk about like so for a like specific example, it was like a time on like this, like a news. Like kind of channel. By Pierce Morgan, where like 317 00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:32.840 huda siraj: all the Muslim speakers that like come to show like I feel like he there's like definitely like lots of clips of him, like shutting them up, or like kinda like erasing their narrative. So like, maybe I could talk about that as 318 00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:42.260 huda siraj: like kind of like under representation. How like censorship is like a big big, like, kind of impact in the world. 319 00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.999 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, that sounds great. 320 00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.010 Jenny Duan: Think that's a good idea. 321 00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:52.179 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool any other questions. 322 00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.770 huda siraj: That's all. For now I think these ones you could probably talk about later. 323 00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:16.829 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. So on Saturday, I think the goal should be to finish the Cmu application and then try to get your letters of Rex asked for, and then later, the next time we meet we can on Saturday. If we have, if you get the chance. We can also talk about the rest of the Jake camp essays. If you have a chance to draft any of them or brainstorm any of the other ones. 324 00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.350 huda siraj: Yeah. Sounds good. 325 00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.640 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool, then take care. Oh, wait! Actually, one thing 326 00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:31.690 Jenny Duan: on Saturday. I'm wondering if we can bump our meeting a little bit earlier. If that's possible. If not,",
    " that's okay, too. But if you were able to do it at like 327 00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:44.170 Jenny Duan: we actually no, it actually doesn't conflict with something. Never mind on on Saturday, or something from 8 to 11. But I forgot that our meetings are earlier on Saturday, so it doesn't actually come back. 328 00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.290 huda siraj: Oh, wait. When are her Saturday meetings? 329 00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:56.150 Jenny Duan: Okay, 8, 45. Wait, no, we actually do need to bump it. Yeah, earlier, if you're free anytime earlier in the day. 330 00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.840 huda siraj: maybe like 331 00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.330 huda siraj: word of 5, if that's why. 332 00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:08.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah. For do you want to do? 4, 15 to 5. Or do you want to do like after that? What time? 333 00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:29.209 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think 4, 15 to 5 sounds good, I think, like cause. I also have, like the sat meeting. At 7 or 6. Yeah. 6. Okay. Cool. Then sounds good. I will see you. 4, 15 on Saturday I'll ask to get that meeting moved. Thank you so much for being flexible. 334 00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:32.339 huda siraj: Bye. Thank you. Bye."
