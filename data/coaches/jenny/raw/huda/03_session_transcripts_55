How's it going. 2 00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.420 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.040 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Did you dye your hair, or has it always been like down the bottom. 4 00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.650 huda: Oh, it has! It's it's just grown out like highlights. 5 00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.763 Jenny Duan: Oh, it's good! I feel like I haven't seen that before. 6 00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.079 Jenny Duan: Well, great to see you! How's code of Clossie going. 7 00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:46.379 huda: It's going. Well, we just had our pitch party today. So we had to pitch our ideas like, I think I mentioned this last time. But we're doing like, an access to like computer in like 3rd World countries type project and like, research into that. 8 00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.190 Jenny Duan: And how is that going for you, or like, how? How is the how's the team, and how's building it? 9 00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.399 huda: It's going well, I think I got I looked out with a pretty good team. Everyone's pretty like passionate about like the topic that we chose. 10 00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.089 Jenny Duan: And how are you building the data? Visualization like, what are the steps involved with that. 11 00:06:05.952 --> 00:06:17.590 huda: We haven't gone to the actual building of the data visualization. But we've started like with the website. And like the prototype for like where we're gonna display it. But yeah. 12 00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.799 Jenny Duan: Well, I'm wondering if I can also have a 13 00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.219 Jenny Duan: an update on the rest of your extracurriculars, and how that's going for you 14 00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.329 Jenny Duan: in terms of like your progress. 15 00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:41.420 huda: Yeah. So for empowering AI, we're currently planning our hackathon. Which is gonna take place in, I think. July 21, st virtually 16 00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:50.810 huda: and so we've come up with a couple of ideas for like how we're gonna run it. So it's gonna be online. And we're gonna have like the calls on discord. 17 00:06:51.130 --> 00:07:01.659 huda: Just so that we don't. We're not like Limited. With the amount of time we can spend on each like workshop and whatnot. And so for the judges, we're trying to get like 18 00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:25.250 huda: So previously, I reached out to a girl who does computer science at Carnegie Mellon, and so like I'm kind of connected with her, and I was gonna ask her if she was willing to become a judge for the hackathon, and then I've also asked in the women and games discord, so whether they'd be willing to do like a judge there, they'd be willing to be a judge or like, do a panel 19 00:07:25.563 --> 00:07:39.680 huda: and then for workshops we wanna reach out to other nonprofits and see if they'd be willing to like do workshop during the hackathon. That way if we have like a bunch of workshops, and that would be like work in our favor. 20 00:07:40.036 --> 00:07:56.180 huda: And I think the hackathon would actually be a good idea, because I've seen like a lot of participants in dev post and then also on top of that like, if we're, we're gonna get their emails as well. And then we could add them to our mail list. And we can, just, you know, grow empowering. AI from there. 21 00:07:56.696 --> 00:07:57.550 huda: So yeah. 22 00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.850 Jenny Duan: How many setups do you have so far. 23 00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.640 huda: Sorry. What did he say? 24 00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.489 Jenny Duan: How many sign ups do you have so far. 25 00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:22.039 huda: Not any so far, cause I haven't published the Hackathon site yet. I'm still setting up like prize logistics, and we're trying to find like companies that might be able to like sponsor some prizes. But yeah, I don't. That hasn't been going too well. 26 00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.700 huda: Cause like. 27 00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:32.099 huda: yeah, like, no, no one's like responded. But, yeah, we're trying to find some sponsors for prizes, and then we can publish it. But yeah. 28 00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:41.299 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Well, it's super exciting to hear like the progress moving so far. When do you think you're gonna open sign ups. 29 00:08:42.281 --> 00:09:09.949 huda: I wanna have it open by maybe like the end of the week. Even if we don't have any sponsors, I think we'd probably like the board might be able to chip in and kind of have a prize for a couple of categories. So yeah, I was thinking like, just by the end of this week, cause obviously, the next 2 weeks I won't be too available, but I wanna have as meant much time as possible to get more people. So I'm trying for, like this weekend. 30 00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.630 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds really good. And then for your other extracurriculars. Do you have any other updates, for example, for folklift or for centuria? 31 00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.333 huda: Yeah for folklift. I've been trying to actually 32 00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:39.414 huda: I've been trying to get like more people to join our cause. So we haven't gotten any writers yet. But I did on board the international writer from India as the Vice President. So now 33 00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.506 huda: we're like, gonna do more tasks like outreach, and also just 34 00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.064 huda: like advertising. So I think that's 35 00:09:50.140 --> 00:10:00.730 huda: going well. And then I also had interviewed a couple of like nonprofits. And then ask them a few questions. And I'm gonna write like an article about them and have it published. 36 00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:07.919 huda: So yeah, I think I think in terms of businesses, I think I can probably reach out to a little bit more. 37 00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:16.839 huda: And then I'm I'm trying to find like similar like international writers, cause I feel like they're a lot more willing to write more 38 00:10:17.295 --> 00:10:23.069 huda: like pieces for folklift. So I'm I'm trying to find like similar profiles. But yeah. 39 00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.010 huda: oh, okay. 40 00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.381 huda: yeah. And then, Cynthoria, I've been doing like a lot of marketing online on 41 00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:42.140 huda: on Tiktok, and actually, like one of my videos are doing pretty well. Not that well, but like it's has like 10.6,000 video views. 42 00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.100 Jenny Duan: That's amazing. That's amazing. 43 00:10:44.680 --> 00:11:00.689 huda: Yeah, thank you. And so, like, I think I've been. I've been really consistent with Tiktok lately like trying to post at least twice a day. And yeah, so like, a lot of people have been curious about Cynthoria. And yeah, I think it's working out well, 44 00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.860 Jenny Duan: Have you been gaining new followers? 45 00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.720 huda: Yeah. Well, I started from 0 like, maybe 46 00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.750 huda: 2 ish months ago. And now I'm at like 45, 47 00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:17.180 huda: so I'm trying to grow that obviously. But I think the progress is going well. 48 00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:23.139 Jenny Duan: What was the what was the video that went viral? What was the subject or content. 49 00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.874 huda: It was actually about Ada Lovelace, actually 50 00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.990 Jenny Duan: Cool. 51 00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:34.590 huda: So I was talking about like how women like were the 1st comp like computer science scientists. 52 00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:47.640 huda: And then I mentioned, like Ada Lovelace being like the 1st computer scientist and then I kind of like mentioned like, oh, she's also part of my game. You should probably check it out, you know. 53 00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.419 Jenny Duan: Is your face in these videos. 54 00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.110 huda: Yeah. 55 00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:56.132 Jenny Duan: Oh, it sounds good cause. Usually they do better if there's a face in it compared to nothing. So 56 00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.259 Jenny Duan: That's good. Let me take a note. 57 00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:21.049 Jenny Duan: I think that one thing that I'm seeing is, it seems like you're doing a lot of this by yourself, but I feel like it could be good to try to get more people involved, to take away some of the work on your end, because it's really exhausting to like, be responsible for everything on your own, and I think it'd be like a lot better for other people to help you out. So 58 00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.609 Jenny Duan: in your mind like, do you think that there's anyone else who could support you on these projects? 59 00:12:27.996 --> 00:12:28.930 huda: What's Cynthoria? 60 00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.319 Jenny Duan: Or just in general. Yeah. 61 00:12:32.108 --> 00:12:43.449 huda: Yeah. So for okay, well, for for empowering. AI, there's like, obviously my board and we've been like alternating with like, take our talk post on that account. 62 00:12:43.732 --> 00:13:02.087 huda: They've been doing like, okay, not as good as like my personal account. And then but then also like planning the hackathon I've had some help from like my vice President. She's been, she said. She's gonna ask like the mayor, and like and like a few of like the Board members if they'd be willing to sponsor some of the prizes. 63 00:13:02.688 --> 00:13:21.150 huda: For the hackathon so I think, and then she's been coming up with a couple of ideas for that. But yeah, like she's gonna be helping me with that. And then my other I think my director of outreach she's gonna be helping me. We wanna plan like a video game like 64 00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:27.039 huda: boot camp like a game development boot camp this summer, so she's helping me plan that curriculum 65 00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:29.919 huda: and then folklift like 66 00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:47.150 huda: I did just have like someone become the vice President. But I I think there's not a lot of help on that one. But yeah, I think I need to start like assigning her to do stuff cause I feel like I haven't accelerated booklift as much. But yeah. 67 00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.650 Jenny Duan: I think also like 68 00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.944 Jenny Duan: having someone helping you with publicity. So reaching out to other orgs is gonna be really big 69 00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.960 Jenny Duan: and also just like 70 00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:02.379 Jenny Duan: trying to get as many other organizations involved as possible. For example, like 71 00:14:02.992 --> 00:14:16.089 Jenny Duan: I don't know if there's an opportunity for you to get like Nc. Wit or codes involved, but like trying to tap into as many resources as you can to see if they can support you. Did you ever reach out to coda classy about sharing, empowering AI. 72 00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.139 huda: Or sh-. 73 00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.429 Jenny Duan: Sharing. Oh, yeah. 74 00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:29.269 huda: I haven't. But I think actually, now might be a perfect time, because of like the camps that are running. Maybe they'll be a little more active. I can reach out and ask 75 00:14:29.983 --> 00:14:37.529 huda: wait. So should I be asking like if they could feature me on like the social media, or like Newsletters, or. 76 00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:43.129 Jenny Duan: Maybe just to share your project if they can help you like. Share your project in some way. 77 00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.660 huda: Okay, that's a good idea. 78 00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.190 Jenny Duan: Do you want to send that email right now? 79 00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.910 huda: Yeah, that'd be good. 80 00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:51.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. 81 00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:15.479 huda: Also in terms of, for like folklift, like what? What should I be like aiming for? Cause? I know I feel like a little bit aimless with that one cause I do have like a little a few more articles, but I don't know how impactful that would be. And I just I wanna know, like, what's the goal and goal for folklift. 82 00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.740 Jenny Duan: I think, to get as many readers as possible, and to have your media featured in as many outlets as possible. 83 00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:32.473 Jenny Duan: I think that should be the goal. So like basically, your goal is to raise awareness for these issues. And the reason, the way that you measure awareness is the number of people who read your work as well as the 84 00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:43.599 Jenny Duan: as well as the like amount of publicity that you have. So, for example, if you're able to write an article that say gets published in team vote, or something like a opinion piece that would be really powerful. 85 00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.632 huda: okay, that's interesting. 86 00:15:48.540 --> 00:16:10.899 huda: also, I think there's like a website like a medium. And then, like everyone just like post their there, I was thinking of like posting all the articles from folklift onto medium under folklift, and see if like that would help cause like I don't know like my like the website, like analytics, if that's completely accurate. 87 00:16:11.352 --> 00:16:22.180 huda: Cause I use like the Google console. But there's only like, like maybe 40 people that go on the site. So I think it might be have have more reach if I put it on medium. 88 00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.985 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that would actually be a good idea as well. Why don't you 89 00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:30.689 Jenny Duan: make a point to do a medium account like today, too? 90 00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.630 huda: Okay. 91 00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.370 Jenny Duan: Oh. 92 00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.450 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. 93 00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.570 Jenny Duan: And then 94 00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:44.040 Jenny Duan: I'm curious, like, in what other ways can you accelerate your impact through local media or through 95 00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.159 Jenny Duan: local news outlets? 96 00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.770 huda: So 97 00:16:54.025 --> 00:16:58.909 huda: were you talking about folklift like how I can increase like my impact for that. 98 00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.140 Jenny Duan: Right, yeah. 99 00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:13.309 huda: yeah, I don't, I think, like, in terms of like local news. I don't know if I'd be able to get featured on there. Cause they don't have any like student writer options. But 100 00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.849 huda: I think. 101 00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.470 huda: yeah, I'm a bit. I'm so bit confused on, like 102 00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.770 huda: how to create more impact other than like readers. 103 00:17:25.243 --> 00:17:26.709 huda: Like the amount of readers. 104 00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.890 Jenny Duan: Do you know what substack is? 105 00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:31.660 huda: No. 106 00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.640 Jenny Duan: It's kind of like medium. So it's an online newsletter campaign. So it's like. 107 00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:50.269 Jenny Duan: meet people can subscribe to your medium. So if you have a blog that a lot of people write that a lot of people read that could be really powerful. You're not. Your primary goal is to get as many people to read your content as possible. That's the goal. 108 00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:51.490 huda: Okay. 109 00:17:52.695 --> 00:17:58.499 huda: Okay. I think I'll sign up on my other computer because I don't have folklift on here. But 110 00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.420 huda: yeah. 111 00:18:01.137 --> 00:18:04.792 huda: who should I email for the coded classy? 112 00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:13.789 Jenny Duan: You can email, instruct@codify.com. That's a good email, or like, if it do, they have a contact@codaclassy.com. 113 00:18:31.377 --> 00:18:36.989 huda: Actually, I remember one time, like the social media manager she like 114 00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.610 huda: messaged me. 115 00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.770 huda: Oh. 116 00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.299 Jenny Duan: I think it's right@codiflossi.com might be the. 117 00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.250 huda: Yes. 118 00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.945 huda: yeah. 119 00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.050 huda: I think I could probably reach out to her. 120 00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.710 Jenny Duan: Okay.

Bad, or you could talk about elections, or they have a lot of different like submission categories. 151 00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.181 huda: Or can you like multiple? If 152 00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.520 huda: seeds. 153 00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:52.020 Jenny Duan: Reported an OP-ed picture pitches across culture, identity, style and politics.

We like main character energy. I could definitely write about like. 175 00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.056 huda: like maybe like a South Asian side character like in 176 00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:31.439 huda: Oh, I could talk about like in Bridgerton, how they added, like South Asian characters, and how they were like able to! How like in the new season. There's actually a part where like Kate, she's like South Asian, and she like wants to go back to India to teach her child like the culture and like, kind of the cultural significance of that being set on TV cause, there's like a lot of people that are like multicultural. 177 00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.069 huda: And maybe they don't get to learn about their like. 178 00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:35.850 huda: Huh! 179 00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:43.230 Jenny Duan: I think that's a cool story, but I also think that that's I think there's already several pieces that feature that in team vogue, unfortunately. 180 00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:53.239 Jenny Duan: or fortunately like that, they're writing about that. But I feel like we might want to think about something a little bit more unique, or like a perspective that hasn't been written about before. 181 00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.070 Jenny Duan: Are there any other? 182 00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.300 Jenny Duan: Oh, look at this!

And she's like 215 00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:36.599 huda: she isn't South Asian, but a lot of like South Asian people like kind of identify like with her. And so maybe I could talk about like, why that is. And like. 216 00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.429 huda: maybe the cultural similarities, but also like, why, there needs to be like 217 00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.729 huda: a more representation. But that might have been like already been talked about. But 218 00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.490 huda: yeah, and I don't think that's really attention grabbing so I don't know. 219 00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:57.689 Jenny Duan: What about something that's like more recent or more modern, like in the news you could always write about like college protest like anything that you think is relevant and timely. 220 00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.129 huda: Maybe I could talk about like 221 00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:15.840 huda: chapel road.

Around like topic of post theme. A lot of people have been concerned with that. 243 00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:12.923 huda: And like, 244 00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.980 huda: yeah, like. 245 00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.980 huda: but yeah, I feel like that's definitely been written about a lot. 246 00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.240 Jenny Duan: What do you? Okay? What's something that hasn't necessarily been written about that you think 247 00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.770 Jenny Duan: could be interesting to write about. 248 00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:38.250 huda: This is kind of broad, but there's like this like kind of view that all like 249 00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:39.630 huda: like 250 00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.929 huda: people that are into like tech. And like 251 00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.800 huda: that. that are into gaming are like 252 00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.669 huda: weird and like 253 00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:57.899 huda: maybe not as like artistic and like maybe deep diving on like.

I can't think of. 256 00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:11.489 Jenny Duan: Okay, how do you think that contributes cause? I think as a journalist, right? Your job is to find original stories out of 257 00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.169 Jenny Duan: maybe the things that everyone else sees. 258 00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.909 Jenny Duan: So how do you necessarily do that. 259 00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.777 huda: I'm not sure. 260 00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.760 Jenny Duan: Okay. 261 00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:33.540 Jenny Duan: I think this is an area where, like, I can't exactly tell you what to write.

So 262 00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:40.400 Jenny Duan: let's look at like a compilation of recent articles in there. Do you want to write about culture identity.

And they're like. 273 00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:28.926 huda: mainly like the same kind of type of artists like they're usually like white. They're usually like girls, 274 00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:30.400 huda: and 275 00:33:31.774 --> 00:33:33.079 huda: I think that's. 276 00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:39.860 Jenny Duan: Okay, I feel like this is not too original. Like, I feel like there's a lot of there's a lot of articles written about the lack of 277 00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.449 Jenny Duan: lack of diversity in media. 278 00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.690 huda: Yeah. 279 00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:49.090 Jenny Duan: So what else could be more original? 280 00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.990 huda: I'm not sure. 281 00:33:59.010 --> 00:33:59.710 Jenny Duan: Okay. 282 00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:08.110 Jenny Duan: okay, so let's but in this case, let's see, like, let's use Chatg to brainstorm. 283 00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.350 Jenny Duan: Think about this.

Everyone's pretty like passionate about like the topic that we chose. 10 00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.089 Jenny Duan: And how are you building the data? Visualization like, what are the steps involved with that. 11 00:06:05.952 --> 00:06:17.590 huda: We haven't gone to the actual building of the data visualization. But we've started like with the website. And like the prototype for like where we're gonna display it. But yeah. 12 00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.799 Jenny Duan: Well, I'm wondering if I can also have a 13 00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.219 Jenny Duan: an update on the rest of your extracurriculars, and how that's going for you 14 00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.329 Jenny Duan: in terms of like your progress. 15 00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:41.420 huda: Yeah. So for empowering AI, we're currently planning our hackathon. Which is gonn",
    "a take place in, I think. July 21, st virtually 16 00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:50.810 huda: and so we've come up with a couple of ideas for like how we're gonna run it. So it's gonna be online. And we're gonna have like the calls on discord. 17 00:06:51.130 --> 00:07:01.659 huda: Just so that we don't. We're not like Limited. With the amount of time we can spend on each like workshop and whatnot. And so for the judges, we're trying to get like 18 00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:25.250 huda: So previously, I reached out to a girl who does computer science at Carnegie Mellon, and so like I'm kind of connected with her, and I was gonna ask her if she was willing to become a judge for the hackathon, and then I've also asked in the women and games discord, so whether they'd be willing to do like a judge there, they'd be willing to be a judge or like, do a panel 19 00:07:25.563 --> 00:07:39.680 huda: and then for workshops we wanna reach out to other nonprofits and see if they'd be willing to like do workshop during the hackathon. That way if we have like a bunch of workshops, and that would be like work in our favor. 20 00:07:40.036 --> 00:07:56.180 huda: And I think the hackathon would actually be a good idea, because I've seen like a lot of participants in dev post and then also on top of that like, if we're, we're gonna get their emails as well. And then we could add them to our mail list. And we can, just, you know, grow empowering. AI from there. 21 00:07:56.696 --> 00:07:57.550 huda: So yeah. 22 00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.850 Jenny Duan: How many setups do you have so far. 23 00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.640 huda: Sorry. What did he say? 24 00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.489 Jenny Duan: How many sign ups do you have so far. 25 00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:22.039 huda: Not any so far, cause I haven't published the Hackathon site yet. I'm still setting up like prize logistics, and we're trying to find like companies that might be able to like sponsor some prizes. But yeah, I don't. That hasn't b",
    "een going too well. 26 00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.700 huda: Cause like. 27 00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:32.099 huda: yeah, like, no, no one's like responded. But, yeah, we're trying to find some sponsors for prizes, and then we can publish it. But yeah. 28 00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:41.299 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Well, it's super exciting to hear like the progress moving so far. When do you think you're gonna open sign ups. 29 00:08:42.281 --> 00:09:09.949 huda: I wanna have it open by maybe like the end of the week. Even if we don't have any sponsors, I think we'd probably like the board might be able to chip in and kind of have a prize for a couple of categories. So yeah, I was thinking like, just by the end of this week, cause obviously, the next 2 weeks I won't be too available, but I wanna have as meant much time as possible to get more people. So I'm trying for, like this weekend. 30 00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.630 Jenny Duan: Okay, that sounds really good. And then for your other extracurriculars. Do you have any other updates, for example, for folklift or for centuria? 31 00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.333 huda: Yeah for folklift. I've been trying to actually 32 00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:39.414 huda: I've been trying to get like more people to join our cause. So we haven't gotten any writers yet. But I did on board the international writer from India as the Vice President. So now 33 00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.506 huda: we're like, gonna do more tasks like outreach, and also just 34 00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.064 huda: like advertising. So I think that's 35 00:09:50.140 --> 00:10:00.730 huda: going well. And then I also had interviewed a couple of like nonprofits. And then ask them a few questions. And I'm gonna write like an article about them and have it published. 36 00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:07.919 huda: So yeah, I think I think in terms of businesses, I think I can probably reach out to a little bit more. 37 00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:16.839 huda: And then I'm I'm t",
    "rying to find like similar like international writers, cause I feel like they're a lot more willing to write more 38 00:10:17.295 --> 00:10:23.069 huda: like pieces for folklift. So I'm I'm trying to find like similar profiles. But yeah. 39 00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.010 huda: oh, okay. 40 00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.381 huda: yeah. And then, Cynthoria, I've been doing like a lot of marketing online on 41 00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:42.140 huda: on Tiktok, and actually, like one of my videos are doing pretty well. Not that well, but like it's has like 10.6,000 video views. 42 00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.100 Jenny Duan: That's amazing. That's amazing. 43 00:10:44.680 --> 00:11:00.689 huda: Yeah, thank you. And so, like, I think I've been. I've been really consistent with Tiktok lately like trying to post at least twice a day. And yeah, so like, a lot of people have been curious about Cynthoria. And yeah, I think it's working out well, 44 00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.860 Jenny Duan: Have you been gaining new followers? 45 00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.720 huda: Yeah. Well, I started from 0 like, maybe 46 00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.750 huda: 2 ish months ago. And now I'm at like 45, 47 00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:17.180 huda: so I'm trying to grow that obviously. But I think the progress is going well. 48 00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:23.139 Jenny Duan: What was the what was the video that went viral? What was the subject or content. 49 00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.874 huda: It was actually about Ada Lovelace, actually 50 00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.990 Jenny Duan: Cool. 51 00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:34.590 huda: So I was talking about like how women like were the 1st comp like computer science scientists. 52 00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:47.640 huda: And then I mentioned, like Ada Lovelace being like the 1st computer scientist and then I kind of like mentioned like, oh, she's also part of my game. You should probably check it out, you know. 53 00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.419 Jenny Duan: Is your face in these videos",
    ". 54 00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.110 huda: Yeah. 55 00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:56.132 Jenny Duan: Oh, it sounds good cause. Usually they do better if there's a face in it compared to nothing. So 56 00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.259 Jenny Duan: That's good. Let me take a note. 57 00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:21.049 Jenny Duan: I think that one thing that I'm seeing is, it seems like you're doing a lot of this by yourself, but I feel like it could be good to try to get more people involved, to take away some of the work on your end, because it's really exhausting to like, be responsible for everything on your own, and I think it'd be like a lot better for other people to help you out. So 58 00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.609 Jenny Duan: in your mind like, do you think that there's anyone else who could support you on these projects? 59 00:12:27.996 --> 00:12:28.930 huda: What's Cynthoria? 60 00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.319 Jenny Duan: Or just in general. Yeah. 61 00:12:32.108 --> 00:12:43.449 huda: Yeah. So for okay, well, for for empowering. AI, there's like, obviously my board and we've been like alternating with like, take our talk post on that account. 62 00:12:43.732 --> 00:13:02.087 huda: They've been doing like, okay, not as good as like my personal account. And then but then also like planning the hackathon I've had some help from like my vice President. She's been, she said. She's gonna ask like the mayor, and like and like a few of like the Board members if they'd be willing to sponsor some of the prizes. 63 00:13:02.688 --> 00:13:21.150 huda: For the hackathon so I think, and then she's been coming up with a couple of ideas for that. But yeah, like she's gonna be helping me with that. And then my other I think my director of outreach she's gonna be helping me. We wanna plan like a video game like 64 00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:27.039 huda: boot camp like a game development boot camp this summer, so she's helping me plan that curriculum 65 00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:29.919 huda: and then f",
    "olklift like 66 00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:47.150 huda: I did just have like someone become the vice President. But I I think there's not a lot of help on that one. But yeah, I think I need to start like assigning her to do stuff cause I feel like I haven't accelerated booklift as much. But yeah. 67 00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.650 Jenny Duan: I think also like 68 00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.944 Jenny Duan: having someone helping you with publicity. So reaching out to other orgs is gonna be really big 69 00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.960 Jenny Duan: and also just like 70 00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:02.379 Jenny Duan: trying to get as many other organizations involved as possible. For example, like 71 00:14:02.992 --> 00:14:16.089 Jenny Duan: I don't know if there's an opportunity for you to get like Nc. Wit or codes involved, but like trying to tap into as many resources as you can to see if they can support you. Did you ever reach out to coda classy about sharing, empowering AI. 72 00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.139 huda: Or sh-. 73 00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.429 Jenny Duan: Sharing. Oh, yeah. 74 00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:29.269 huda: I haven't. But I think actually, now might be a perfect time, because of like the camps that are running. Maybe they'll be a little more active. I can reach out and ask 75 00:14:29.983 --> 00:14:37.529 huda: wait. So should I be asking like if they could feature me on like the social media, or like Newsletters, or. 76 00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:43.129 Jenny Duan: Maybe just to share your project if they can help you like. Share your project in some way. 77 00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.660 huda: Okay, that's a good idea. 78 00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.190 Jenny Duan: Do you want to send that email right now? 79 00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.910 huda: Yeah, that'd be good. 80 00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:51.770 Jenny Duan: Okay. 81 00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:15.479 huda: Also in terms of, for like folklift, like what? What should I be like aiming for? Cause? I know I feel like a little",
    " bit aimless with that one cause I do have like a little a few more articles, but I don't know how impactful that would be. And I just I wanna know, like, what's the goal and goal for folklift. 82 00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.740 Jenny Duan: I think, to get as many readers as possible, and to have your media featured in as many outlets as possible. 83 00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:32.473 Jenny Duan: I think that should be the goal. So like basically, your goal is to raise awareness for these issues. And the reason, the way that you measure awareness is the number of people who read your work as well as the 84 00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:43.599 Jenny Duan: as well as the like amount of publicity that you have. So, for example, if you're able to write an article that say gets published in team vote, or something like a opinion piece that would be really powerful. 85 00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.632 huda: okay, that's interesting. 86 00:15:48.540 --> 00:16:10.899 huda: also, I think there's like a website like a medium. And then, like everyone just like post their there, I was thinking of like posting all the articles from folklift onto medium under folklift, and see if like that would help cause like I don't know like my like the website, like analytics, if that's completely accurate. 87 00:16:11.352 --> 00:16:22.180 huda: Cause I use like the Google console. But there's only like, like maybe 40 people that go on the site. So I think it might be have have more reach if I put it on medium. 88 00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.985 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that would actually be a good idea as well. Why don't you 89 00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:30.689 Jenny Duan: make a point to do a medium account like today, too? 90 00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.630 huda: Okay. 91 00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.370 Jenny Duan: Oh. 92 00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.450 Jenny Duan: okay, cool. 93 00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.570 Jenny Duan: And then 94 00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:44.040 Jenny Duan: I'm curious, like, in what other way",
    "s can you accelerate your impact through local media or through 95 00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.159 Jenny Duan: local news outlets? 96 00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.770 huda: So 97 00:16:54.025 --> 00:16:58.909 huda: were you talking about folklift like how I can increase like my impact for that. 98 00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.140 Jenny Duan: Right, yeah. 99 00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:13.309 huda: yeah, I don't, I think, like, in terms of like local news. I don't know if I'd be able to get featured on there. Cause they don't have any like student writer options. But 100 00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.849 huda: I think. 101 00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.470 huda: yeah, I'm a bit. I'm so bit confused on, like 102 00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.770 huda: how to create more impact other than like readers. 103 00:17:25.243 --> 00:17:26.709 huda: Like the amount of readers. 104 00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.890 Jenny Duan: Do you know what substack is? 105 00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:31.660 huda: No. 106 00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.640 Jenny Duan: It's kind of like medium. So it's an online newsletter campaign. So it's like. 107 00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:50.269 Jenny Duan: meet people can subscribe to your medium. So if you have a blog that a lot of people write that a lot of people read that could be really powerful. You're not. Your primary goal is to get as many people to read your content as possible. That's the goal. 108 00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:51.490 huda: Okay. 109 00:17:52.695 --> 00:17:58.499 huda: Okay. I think I'll sign up on my other computer because I don't have folklift on here. But 110 00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.420 huda: yeah. 111 00:18:01.137 --> 00:18:04.792 huda: who should I email for the coded classy? 112 00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:13.789 Jenny Duan: You can email, instruct@codify.com. That's a good email, or like, if it do, they have a contact@codaclassy.com. 113 00:18:31.377 --> 00:18:36.989 huda: Actually, I remember one time, like the social media manager she like 114 00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38",
    ".610 huda: messaged me. 115 00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.770 huda: Oh. 116 00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.299 Jenny Duan: I think it's right@codiflossi.com might be the. 117 00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.250 huda: Yes. 118 00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.945 huda: yeah. 119 00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.050 huda: I think I could probably reach out to her. 120 00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.710 Jenny Duan: Okay.
