Yeah, I'm good. It's been. 2 00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:25.430 Jenny Duan: It's been a lot. I mean, I'm in Boston right now. But I've also been following like the news about like the Palestine, it's real crisis. And yeah, I'm like, so sorry that that's happening. And like, I've been looking at your stories, too. And like. 3 00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.730 Jenny Duan: I really feel like there's so much suffering out there. And like, it's really like. 4 00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.859 Jenny Duan: yeah, definitely, there's like a lot of like misinformation going around. So 5 00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.970 huda: yeah, it's terrible. 6 00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.600 Jenny Duan: Hmm. alright. So 7 00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:54.429 Jenny Duan: I just wanted to acknowledge that that like that's something I know it's been on your mind. It's on my mind, too. And like. yeah, can't really forget about that going on. 8 00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:06.470 Jenny Duan: okay, so let's just get started. I'm wondering if we can just start with like a quick overview. How is the sat? I feel like I never really got to like debrief that fully with you. How did it go? 9 00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:36.250 huda: So I think initially, my initial thought was, I think I did really well, at least. The reading section went really smoothly for me, cause there weren't any historical passages which meant, like the language was pretty straightforward, and it was kinda easy for me to understand and then also, I guess, English they don't have too many hard concepts on there. But I think I might have gotten one question wrong. 10 00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.049 huda: And then for mask. No calculator, I know for a fact. I got one of the questions wrong. 11 00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:55.870 huda: I'd say, like I did better in reading. At least I think so. But I think I didn't do too terribly, at least for the math with calculator. I think I did really well on that one? Yeah. 12 00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.200 Jenny Duan: that's so awesome. When do you get your scores back? 13 00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.449 huda: Next weekend. 14 00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.339 Jenny Duan: Okay? So hopefully, that goes really? Well, 15 00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.510 Jenny Duan: so, yeah. And I fear that you have your PSAT coming up right? 16 00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.520 Yeah. 17 00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:25.990 Jenny Duan: And that's on Monday, right? Or would it be tomorrow? Why is it on the weekend? I've literally never heard of that. It being on a weekend before. I don't know. That's how they do our testing in our school. 18 00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.229 Jenny Duan: Sam, I remember in my high school, like everyone, be well. 19 00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:49.839 Jenny Duan: half of people at my school be really excited because they get like their day off or half of their off because of the standardized testing, and the other half would be super stress, because they would be like, Oh, my gosh! I have standardized testing coming up. So how was that? My school? But that's interesting that they do it on the weekends? I've yeah, not heard of that for 20 00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.039 Jenny Duan: so interesting. 21 00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.610 Jenny Duan: Okay, well. 22 00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.040 Jenny Duan: beyond that, do you have any other updates? How did the filming go? 23 00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:10.639 huda: So one of the people were like out of town. Till the 20 third. Actually. So we weren't able to film. And I'm kind of like. 24 00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.409 huda: I'm trying to get more people. So I have like more like available days. 25 00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.359 huda: And then I got my 26 00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:42.490 huda: like my co like partner. I got her to like agree on the date as well, but like they just, I messaged them. I was like, okay, so are we set on this day. I finished a script and everything but like they're like, Oh, I'm sorry. Actually, we're out of town until the 20 third, and I was kind of blind sighted cause they told me that they were available. But 27 00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.130 Jenny Duan: yeah. 28 00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:58.320 huda: yeah, I think I'll try to like contact more people so that I'm not like putting all my eggs on one basket and like kind of I'll have like a back up option in case one person isn't available to phone. 29 00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.009 Jenny Duan: You know what would be a really interesting angle for 2 for you. If this 30 00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.170 Jenny Duan: so I feel like the issue right here has been like. 31 00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.820 Jenny Duan: there's not been 32 00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:29.089 Jenny Duan: interviewing people, but I'm wondering like it would be really cool for you to do profiles on like just the Muslim community in general. Right now. Especially because I feel like there's a lot of Islamophobia happening, and there's just like a lot of misinformation in general. So it'd be interesting for you, cause you're interested in journalism to do some like 33 00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:38.540 Jenny Duan: I don't know, like non-biased reporting on the situation. With the Hamas Israel Hamas war or 34 00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.230 Jenny Duan: just like to do some 35 00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.050 Jenny Duan: stories of like 36 00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:55.750 Jenny Duan: the Muslim community in the United States, and like maybe sharing a little bit about that. I don't know if that's too sensitive of a topic, but I do feel like like I would really like to see like in impartial news source, because I feel like all the news I've 37 00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:08.019 Jenny Duan: Fred is really, really biased. And I don't like in one direction or another, and I don't like seeing that, so I don't know. I feel like that would be something to keep in the back of your head. 38 00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.520 Jenny Duan: just because I think it's like. 39 00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:16.610 Jenny Duan: first of all, it's necessary. And it's also kind of topical right now. But it's also very sensitive, sensitive topic. So I don't know 40 00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.920 Jenny Duan: lots of things to consider. 41 00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:26.139 huda: So you know what actually I was thinking would kind of be more convenient, for now I think I can start set up, maybe like 42 00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:43.499 huda: articles, maybe about like the small businesses that I'm talking to that way like they could like answer my questions, and I've set up calls with them as well. So I can like write articles about them for now and then, maybe in the future, when they're available, we can start actually filming. 43 00:07:43.930 --> 00:08:03.700 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Cause I don't think it has to be like like, the medium doesn't matter like it's just the message, right? So the message that you're raising awareness. But it could be like it could be like an article. It could be like a newsletter. It could be videos, it could be a podcast it could be. Whatever is easiest for you to produce the content. So all that all that matters is like you have the content out there, so 44 00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:31.569 Jenny Duan: maybe you can just draft up the articles for now and then like leave a couple of spaces in the articles where you can get like quotes from them, or something that will be easier if you could send them like a questionnaire, and they could fill that out instead. I don't know. I did something similar in high school, too. Actually, I did like local journalism, for my neighborhood had their own magazine like a neighborhood publication. So that's actually something you could consider doing. If you feel like your neighborhood would be interested in that 45 00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:42.689 Jenny Duan: the way that works in my neighborhood. I don't know if your neighborhood has a magazine, but the way that it works in my neighborhood is like we do specific profile stories about, like the different families in the neighborhood 46 00:08:42.690 --> 00:09:02.549 Jenny Duan: and like different events that are happening, you know, at the local high school elementary school, and then local businesses would pay for advertisements in the magazine, and then, you know, the magazine gets sent out every month and would have these like ads from local businesses. And then also, just like the stories of things that are happening in the neighborhood. So that's another 47 00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.639 Jenny Duan: thing to consider. 48 00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.929 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, so 49 00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:21.490 Jenny Duan: I wanted to, just just like, before we get too deep into this today, would you like to focus more on Psat prep, or would you just like to do like the normal like working on your extracurriculars and like everything else? 50 00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:34.479 huda: So since it's kind of like a longer section session. I was kinda hoping we talk about extracurriculars. For, like the most of it, and then maybe a theme, we could just review some like important tips before 51 00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.770 huda: the Psid tomorrow. 52 00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.159 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. 53 00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.910 Jenny Duan: That sounds good. So, okay. 54 00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.419 Jenny Duan: so that's how the film film project is going. How is filmmakers? Club going. 55 00:09:45.910 --> 00:10:02.579 huda: Yeah. So we decided our I don't know if I'll be updated on on this. But we have our new officers. And we decided on our first film project, which is kind of it's kinda Corny. But we're gonna make like a parody of breaking bad. But like. 56 00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:21.030 huda: and obviously, pg, like it's gonna be kinda about like homework or something. And like, we try to to like kinda have like a stylistic like, you know how the office has that one like camera like style? Do that? So 57 00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:31.080 huda: yeah. and we're like planning our next meeting to like officiate like this project and then get everyone their roles and everything. So yeah. 58 00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.639 Jenny Duan: okay. that's awesome. 59 00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:43.990 huda: Oh, yeah, also. So remember that. Like professional Instagram. I opened up so like over 60 00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.209 huda: over like last week. I think I posted this like 61 00:10:48.470 --> 00:11:05.239 huda: real Instagram reel is just like that frustrating feeling when you get an error in your code. And then and then I did like in the captions like tips for like debugging your code. And it it didn't get that famous. But I think I got like a hundred like 20 views. But yeah, that's good. 62 00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.930 huda: Yeah. 63 00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.040 Jenny Duan: with the Instagram algorithm discussion. You just need to like 64 00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.049 Jenny Duan: posts like consistently, and then it'll. 65 00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:22.300 Jenny Duan: But that's like the hardest thing is just to like, be consistent with posting. Obviously. Hmm. 66 00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.450 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay. 67 00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.910 Jenny Duan: okay. 68 00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.280 Jenny Duan: And to start back. 69 00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:40.350 Jenny Duan: And then, okay, full cliff. We already talked about that empowering. A. I. How is that going? 70 00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:54.899 huda: Okay? So empowering? AI, we just finished our first cahu and slides slideshow. I'm almost finished with the second slideshow. Like, we outlined everything we're gonna talk about like for all the meetings 71 00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:16.199 huda: and also. So our web developer like for like, we had this person as a web developer. But she hasn't showed us progress. And like we basically extended her week to 2 weeks. So then she didn't do it again. So then, I started working on the website like on web flow, just like kinda have something in the meantime. 72 00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.459 huda: So I'm just trying to like make a note code thing, cause I don't really think we need a 73 00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.250 huda: like a self programmed web site right now. But if we do like. 74 00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:32.679 huda: we'll probably get that resource in the future. We just kind of need something up and running. So I started building that 75 00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.579 huda: I can show you on my screen. Actually. 76 00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.210 huda: So this is kind of 77 00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.679 huda: it's like the home page. 78 00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.440 huda: and then 79 00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.239 Jenny Duan: that looks so good. 80 00:12:51.360 --> 00:13:01.279 huda: Thank you. And then this one, it's like, it's kind of like this stuff is like, obviously not a line to ours, but these are kind of a description for a boot camp. 81 00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.589 huda: And then like, when we have more events and stuff, we can have that 82 00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.729 Jenny Duan: that looks really good. Hooda. Thank you. 83 00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.680 huda: Yeah, that's all for now. But yeah. And then 84 00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:23.069 huda: we just kinda like planned all the slides that we're gonna make like we're doing. The first one's gonna be computer basics. 85 00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:37.229 huda: They learn like, really basic stuff about python like variables and stuff. And then in the second one you learn more about like if statements loops like dictionaries and stuff, and then 86 00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:54.290 huda: kinda like learning more about like specifically how AR works. And then the next meeting, we're gonna talk about like how to make your own AI model. And I actually found, like, I found an idea, for like how we can teach them an AI model like a really simple one. 87 00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:04.649 huda: And then the last one is kind of going to be more about AI ethics and like job opportunities in it. And stuff like that. Yeah. 88 00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:13.050 Jenny Duan: awesome. And I guess, do you have you sent sent out the signup form, how's that going? 89 00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.929 huda: Yeah. So I'm not really sure like. 90 00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:26.240 huda: do you suggest I share it in like like our mountain house, or like our town's Facebook, or cause I don't know if I want to like. 91 00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.160 huda: I don't know if I should go public with it right now, but I don't know. 92 00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.119 huda: What do you suggest? 93 00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think you should send it out to 94 00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:41.679 Jenny Duan: maybe like like, maybe you can make flyers and put them up in your local library. 95 00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:47.099 Jenny Duan: And maybe you can send them out to like 96 00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:56.160 Jenny Duan: well teachers, because I think that would be a good resource, and they could share with their classes like for middle schoolers or whatever your target audience is. 97 00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.980 huda: That sounds good. Okay. 98 00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:06.799 huda: maybe we could. Also, I think we can work on, maybe sending out like an email to other like middle school people. 99 00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.670 huda: Yeah. 100 00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:25.140 Jenny Duan: okay, that's awesome. That sounds like a good idea. Also, there's like people within your own network, too. your teachers, little schoolers like your own family friends, or people who you think might be interested 101 00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.880 Jenny Duan: and doing this type of thing. That would be a good idea, too. 102 00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.490 Jenny Duan: Alright. 103 00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.609 Jenny Duan: amazing. And then. 104 00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.990 Jenny Duan: in general, how's the game going? Do you have any updates on that. 105 00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:46.670 huda: Yeah. So I think I made a lot of progress on my game. So like I was able to start like 106 00:15:46.830 --> 00:16:12.319 huda: implementing stuff was seen with Ada Lovelace. She's like one of the professors in it. So like I kinda implemented the dialogue really? Well, and I'd say the only thing really left for me to do is just kind of make, I guess the boss's fight, and then kind of the classification model but other than that. I feel like the game is flowing pretty well. 107 00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.769 yeah, I think. 108 00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:25.410 huda: I need to also make more sprites for like different settings. But I think we made like a lot of progress in terms of like the storyline. Yeah. 109 00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:39.839 Jenny Duan: that's really cool. And then how are you like sharing your progress. So I still feel like, like, I want you to have more recognition for this, because I feel like it's super cool. And I want, you know more people to know what it is, and you know, engage with it. 110 00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:49.459 huda: So do you think it's like it would be like wise of me to like like post about it on my professional account. Cause cause. One thing is like there's like 111 00:16:49.550 --> 00:17:07.069 huda: that guy's telling you about who's doing like the boot camps and stuff. He also started like a game development boot camp. So like I don't know if I'm sure I don't know. No, I don't think so. Like. 112 00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:17.249 huda: okay, what I'm confused about is this this guy? He also did like a sat like boot camp thing, even though he didn't take the sat. So I'm I'm not sure 113 00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:23.459 Jenny Duan: I would say, like Block, do you have just? Instagram could just block him like on everything. 114 00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:33.930 Jenny Duan: One person like one negative person should not disrupt your whole experience like doing something that you truly care about. You know what I mean like, I feel like that shouldn't 115 00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.530 Jenny Duan: be a factor in your life. 116 00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:44.749 huda: Yeah. So do you think I should share it? Or do you think it's like I'm kind of sharing too much? I don't know. 117 00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:56.779 Jenny Duan: Oh, I feel like you should definitely share it like if you're not comfortable with sharing it to a news like to your Instagram, maybe you can like. are there any other like gaming communities or channels that you feel like you could 118 00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.270 Jenny Duan: put it on 119 00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.760 Jenny Duan: like hat club like, are you in the Hat Club slack. I think you should put it in there. 120 00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.149 huda: Okay, that's a good idea. 121 00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.930 Jenny Duan: And like you should 122 00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.560 Jenny Duan: make a website for your game. 123 00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:16.689 Jenny Duan: That's what I think. Like, you should make a website to like, advertise your game. Do you know what I mean? 124 00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:29.470 huda: That's okay. Yeah. I think I can. Do you suggest? Like, I cause I think if I have too many coding projects going on, I think I could just make like a no code website for the for the meantime. 125 00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:34.660 huda: Yeah, it doesn't have to be like a.

So I finished the second essay as well. 297 00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:12.329 huda: I like kind of sketch like an outline kinda of what I want wanted for, like the third one and your screen so we can go through those. 298 00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:15.230 huda: Yeah, it's like on the dark way. 299 00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.940 Jenny Duan: Okay. 300 00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.640 huda: yeah, it's like a lot earlier, like. I think I was like. 301 00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.559 Jenny Duan: let me just find on my screen. Actually, okay. 302 00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:43.450 huda: okay. 303 00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:52.960 huda: And this is the one like, I kind of like, refined it to 2 50 words. But it's kind of what we're talking about. 304 00:35:53.570 --> 00:36:01.920 Jenny Duan: yeah. 305 00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.270 Jenny Duan: this is really good. This is much better. 306 00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.579 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, I think what I would like to see is, can I look back at the prompt one more time? 307 00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:24.530 Jenny Duan: Okay. 308 00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.880 Jenny Duan: And 309 00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:42.749 Jenny Duan: I would like you to see, maybe, like one more sentence about what you like, making sure that you show that you want to go to college to study computer science because, or game development, or something along that field. 310 00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:52.209 Jenny Duan: Cause, I feel like that's really important for you to just mention that and saying how you want to like, what, specifically, do you want to do so? I think that 311 00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:56.270 Jenny Duan: that's like, maybe it'd be nice to get more specific. Yeah. 312 00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.989 huda: So like. I'd probably somewhere like here, maybe I could 313 00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:06.960 huda: myself taking the next. 314 00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.519 Jenny Duan: it's shaping the tech industry's workforce as a 315 00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:18.559 Jenny Duan: game developer, as a software engineer, as a insert whatever you want to do. Game developer. 316 00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.609 Jenny Duan: Yes, that's awesome. 317 00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.370 Jenny Duan: Instead of saying word you could say. R. 318 00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.709 Jenny Duan: Never mind, never mind. 319 00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.810 Jenny Duan: There. 320 00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:38.019 Jenny Duan: Similar to 321 00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:42.430 Jenny Duan: II envisioned myself. Okay. Pursuing 322 00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.579 Jenny Duan: a degree. II envisioned myself. Going to college, to 323 00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:56.190 Jenny Duan: majoring. Or I envision myself majoring in computer science in college to take a central role 324 00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:03.009 Jenny Duan: okay? Or and taking a central role majoring in computer science in college. 325 00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.000 Jenny Duan: And then taking. 326 00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:12.310 Jenny Duan: Oh. or, yeah, to take. that's fine 327 00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:19.320 huda: and trouble in shaping the tech industry's work force as a game developer. 328 00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:24.060 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can just say, shaping the tech industry. You don't have to say the tech industry's work force. 329 00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.030 Jenny Duan: Oh, as a game developer, yeah, that's still important. 330 00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.869 Jenny Duan: How many words. Is that 331 00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.799 huda: 2, 51, because probably 332 00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.860 huda: probably some fluff words around here. 333 00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.029 Jenny Duan: Typing lines of code. Just take away the at 334 00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.420 Jenny Duan: yeah. And then you should be good. 335 00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:14.370 Jenny Duan: awesome, cool. It's really good, Huda. How do you feel about that essay? I feel like it's really good. 336 00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:26.200 huda: Thank you. It was honestly, because of your your outline. I kinda it truly helped me like, kind of verbalize it. And yeah, I think 337 00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.529 huda: I think definitely I kind of wanted to focus more on, like 338 00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:39.239 huda: he also indescriptive. I wanted to like, be more descriptive. It's a Starbucks. So yeah, it's funny, like the exact image that I imagined so 339 00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.730 Jenny Duan: awesome. 340 00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.930 huda: Go ahead. 341 00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.580 huda: which would probably be 7 of them. Yeah. 342 00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.580 Jenny Duan: is this really 343 00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:06.260 Jenny Duan: But no, this is so good, especially because it connects to your passion for developing games. 344 00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:18.890 Jenny Duan: I think it'd be really interesting if you can talk about how you see video games as a method for solving or educating people about real world problems. For example, talking about the game that you're developing and you're also 345 00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.690 Jenny Duan: maybe like how video games are important to like 346 00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:31.230 Jenny Duan: showing girls what's possible in stem, because your like, your video game has you know, strong female leads. It shows like 347 00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:39.749 Jenny Duan: it talks about the history of like female programmers. And all of that is super important. Obviously. some of that in here 348 00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:51.460 huda: that's like kind of the like kind of direction. I was going to, but I wasn't like I was working on this like the week before SAT. So I kind of tried to make it quick. But yeah. 349 00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:58.579 huda: so yeah, I think I can. Go into that deeper. 350 00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.830 huda: yeah. 351 00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.369 huda: Do you have any like changes that you think I should make on here. 352 00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:13.649 Jenny Duan: you maybe say, like, during my research process, I found that. 353 00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.750 Jenny Duan: or I feel like what you're saying is fine. 354 00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:19.810 Jenny Duan: Is that violent 355 00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.010 Jenny Duan: in many 356 00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:28.210 Jenny Duan: reflected on this behaviour with violence. Many. That violent video games encouraged this behavior. 357 00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:36.790 Jenny Duan: I maybe you could. You don't have to say, providing no benefit. You can just say, like, video games encourage this behavior 358 00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:43.780 Jenny Duan: is that some video games, maybe not violent because they some video games. 359 00:41:45.600 --> 00:42:00.570 Jenny Duan: And I don't know how many words you have. If you have extra words you can maybe write about, you know, to day like the most popular video games are like first person shooter games. But you see a world in which, like the most popular video games, are ones that are focused on education and social good. 360 00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:07.520 huda: Yeah, someone's really fun. They can be fun to play. But also, you know, like providing some type of benefit to the world. 361 00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:16.000 huda: Yeah. I think I'm gonna talk a bit more about like. And yeah, like, kind of how I think that 362 00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:31.210 huda: kinda educational games are kind of the best of both worlds. And they're kinda like teach something, and especially have a great influence on younger audiences and kind of at the same time, they're fun. So I think that's kind of what I'm talk, gonna talk about 363 00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.800 huda: pounds. Yeah. 364 00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:41.110 Jenny Duan: Sounds perfect. Okay, cool. And then what about your first essay? Describe your journey about technology? 365 00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:46.079 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think this is the one we talked about earlier. 366 00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.540 Is this 250 words? 367 00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.750 huda: Yeah. 368 00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:59.660 huda: think so. 369 00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:09.390 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think you should extend the last paragraph a little bit, because it sounds like it's a little cut off. Do you see what I mean? 370 00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.480 Jenny Duan: What is the prompt? Can we look at that again? 371 00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:28.799 huda: I was just on describe your journey. Okay. 372 00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.149 Jenny Duan: okay, so can we go back to yours? 373 00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:35.970 Jenny Duan: Questions? 374 00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:52.350 Jenny Duan: okay, what about it? By the desire? I said. during the process of developing in a I education game on Youtube. I also found a number of profit just like my 7 year old self to pursue their technology dreams. 375 00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.299 Jenny Duan: and maybe you can add, like one more sentence about how you see technology like 376 00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:07.579 Jenny Duan: how you see it influencing your life today. Maybe you can say like today, like I, you know, hope to XYZ. 377 00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.830 Jenny Duan: Interested in what you know that type of thing. 378 00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:16.570 huda: Do you think I should write like a sentence. Maybe like like 379 00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:20.960 huda: technology became less of a mysterious 380 00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:27.850 huda: figure to me and and and evolved into a tool that allowed me to express myself. 381 00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.969 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and also help other people in the process. 382 00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.610 huda: Yeah. 383 00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.040 Jenny Duan: perfect. 384 00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:05.870 huda: Let me just see. 385 00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.289 huda: Okay, it's still under yeah. 386 00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.729 huda: 2 50 387 00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:13.610 Jenny Duan: awesome. 388 00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.579 Jenny Duan: I don't think I wouldn't say like technology was once a mysterious figure. 389 00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:37.099 huda: I kind of emphasize, because in the beginning I used to only see as like a sci-fi kinda like like a far like kinda distant thing. But it kind of like influenced my life all aspects of my life and kind of show that 390 00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:42.350 huda: kind of like it was different to me. But now it's like part of me, I guess. 391 00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.709 Jenny Duan: Okay, is there a way we can 392 00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.420 Jenny Duan: rephrase that last sentence 393 00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.640 huda: technology one. 394 00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:03.529 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say today, I no longer. New technology has a 395 00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:11.600 Jenny Duan: I'm writing a sentence in the chat right now. So I no longer view technology as a sci-fi 396 00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:18.180 Jenny Duan: superpower, fantasy, mystery. 397 00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:27.529 Jenny Duan: mystery, but rather as a powerful tool. But 398 00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:35.320 Jenny Duan: no April's meeting to express myself and 399 00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:40.409 Jenny Duan: empower others in the conference. 400 00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:56.480 huda: Did you say, like technology evolve, evolved from 401 00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:05.000 huda: from a sci-fi fantasy into a powerful tool like, I think the evolved wording kind of 402 00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:06.570 huda: I like things 403 00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:15.659 huda: are. I think it's, I think. actually, the sentence in the chat is kind of more better, because 404 00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:23.610 huda: because that way. I kinda show that it's how I view it, not the technology, I guess. 405 00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.210 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 406 00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.980 huda: let me just see. 407 00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.520 huda: Okay, that's one word over. So 408 00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.400 Jenny Duan: maybe you can just cut. 409 00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:12.529 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can just say I had only ever seen in sci-fi mood. please. I don't think you need the before. 410 00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:18.009 Jenny Duan: because you'd only ever seen the first paragraph. 411 00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:26.680 Jenny Duan: something you'd only ever seen in sci-fi movies. You'll need the before, because the only ever seen already implies that before. Does that make sense. 412 00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.560 huda: Hmm. 413 00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:39.979 huda: I don't think I used before actually in sci fi movies before it's the word after movies. Oh, okay, sorry. There you go now, are you done with the word out? 414 00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:42.990 huda: Yeah. 415 00:48:43.540 --> 00:49:00.789 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel like this is looking good. I think after you finish the last one we can go over that one more time, and then you should be able to honestly submit it. At that point. We're not missing anything else right for this. Let me just show you my application. 416 00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:13.939 Jenny Duan: And also like it's option optional. But you can also, like provide like some links of your project. So that's a perfect opportunity. You have so many, you have so many projects. Right? That's perfect. 417 00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:18.520 huda: Okay, let me just share, like what I put on here. 418 00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.270 Jenny Duan: I'm really happy with your writing today. I feel like your writing quality has improved a lot. 419 00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:26.590 huda: Thank you. 420 00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:30.029 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. 421 00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.940 huda: sorry. So this is like, the 422 00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:41.269 Jenny Duan: I would add a parentheses after every one of these and say what it is. For example, you should say, 423 00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:56.870 Jenny Duan: job board job board. I developed. For I I'm just saying words you don't have to for my for the unemployment. 424 00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:57.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 425 00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.230 Jenny Duan: in my community. 426 00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:11.350 Jenny Duan: And then what did you use to develop it with. I use react. I developed with react. 427 00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.620 Jenny Duan: oh, or using react? Yeah, that's 428 00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.279 Jenny Duan: okay. And then 429 00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:33.040 huda: this is like, I mean, like a von I wouldn't put a dash. I would just put the parentheses, because when they're copy paste they might copy, paste the dash in. Oh, okay, and this is. Oh. 430 00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.010 Jenny Duan: is there a way you could show it without the Github login. 431 00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:43.470 huda: I think. Wait! I might have put the wrong link. Wait. 432 00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.539 huda: I'm glad I checked that 433 00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.529 Jenny Duan: it's all good. 434 00:50:48.390 --> 00:51:05.439 huda: Let me just oh, basically it's on like a volunteering, website, where like, you put in like your location and or like your right now, it's kinda only in la area. But you've like put in your location, and then it gives you 435 00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:13.240 huda: It gives you like opportunities near you with like links and stuff. And we use like an Api to make it so. 436 00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.050 huda: And 437 00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:21.470 huda: is this the same thing? 438 00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:26.939 I think so. 439 00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:35.700 huda: Oh, no! Is this a different so and 440 00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:40.819 huda: so you could be like a month? 441 00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:43.530 huda: hmm! 442 00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.610 huda: Right? Maybe that's not a bitting itself for him 443 00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.410 huda: is this gonna work anymore? 444 00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:03.660 huda: And it's a working on my other account, it's, strange, maybe I shouldn't put that one. 445 00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:12.850 huda: let me just check if it's working on my. 446 00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:20.700 huda: okay, yeah, I don't know why it's not working, but 447 00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.209 huda: I think I should probably remove that then. 448 00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:30.490 huda: And 449 00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:37.250 Jenny Duan: is there another link like, can you publish it somewhere and then put the link something like that? 450 00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:43.400 huda: This is like a how. I usually publish my code like like 451 00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.870 huda: on here on netify 452 00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:56.090 Jenny Duan: How come it doesn't? The link doesn't link. It was it was working a couple of days ago when I was entering it. But 453 00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:58.569 huda: I'm not sure. 454 00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:09.240 huda: yeah, okay, I could just use something different then. 455 00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.890 huda: I have a few other things I can put. 456 00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:22.080 huda: I have like 457 00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:31.810 huda: this project is called Netiverse. It was for a hackathon. And basically it was like you should just put the you should put the link to the 458 00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.090 Jenny Duan: nullify and try. Try one more time. 459 00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:44.240 Jenny Duan: Working on my other account, either. Now. is it because of Netlifi like? Is there something wrong with that? 460 00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:50.130 huda: I am not entirely sure but this one's like a different project that I did have. 461 00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:59.819 Jenny Duan: you should put that, too. 462 00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:03.760 Jenny Duan: And then oh, maybe you can put like a. 463 00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:06.959 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can put like screenshots like. 464 00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:17.169 Jenny Duan: why don't you make a Google presentation? Take screenshots of your other like a Google slides. Take screenshots of your netlify one and put just put like screenshots in. 465 00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:28.670 Jenny Duan: And then like and like types, a little bit of text. This shouldn't take you too long. Type a little text like explaining how each page works, and then just link the drive. That should be good if if the network doesn't work cause, I don't want you to. 466 00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:33.259 Jenny Duan: I don't want you to just like not be able to show that, you know. 467 00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:38.200 huda: Yeah. And this is the one that has a chat box. So and 468 00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:41.120 huda: take 469 00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.630 huda: this. 470 00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:58.939 huda: yeah, there's like. and was just something that I worked on like a couple like 2 years ago. 471 00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.360 huda: I mean. 472 00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:08.990 huda: yeah. 473 00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:21.430 Jenny Duan: that looks really good. I love the Chatbot feature. Thank you. How did you make that? That's so cool? It was like, there's like this, land like Api thing like, Oh, cool! 474 00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:30.250 huda: It's not honestly, not that complex which is kind of I don't know if I should share this. But yeah. 475 00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:35.320 Jenny Duan: you should share share anything that you can, and share as much as you can. 476 00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:40.840 huda: And then you could just like this one just really basic. But like, say, you like, measure like your 477 00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:44.300 huda: Rp, and it's like. like, really high. 478 00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.750 Jenny Duan: that's really cool try again, or get modified attention 479 00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.150 huda: like, if you do like 10 or something, this is the same thing. 480 00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.160 huda: Maybe it'll just 481 00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:01.339 huda: it's just gonna be normal. But yeah. 482 00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:07.320 huda: I'm trying to think of any other projects that I did 483 00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:15.040 huda: registered on like entering these now. 484 00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.070 huda: but we obviously for these together. So 485 00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:30.450 huda: yeah, I'll like, I'll let you know like which which, like a lynx, I end up putting on here. So 486 00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:43.009 Jenny Duan: okay, so can we just like go over like some tips, maybe on the pst right now. So I think the main thing is just having your 487 00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:53.739 Jenny Duan: confidence ready. And then also like being adjusted to the online format. So I mean, I think. how did you like go into the sat? And how did you feel when you were going in? 488 00:56:54.380 --> 00:57:04.079 huda: I think I was like really nervous for the SAT. But honestly, I was trying not to think about it on the way there, but after I felt kind of good about it. 489 00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:17.480 huda: cause us kinda do like a slower pace, but like still understanding everything that's really good. I feel like that's kind of the mindset. I feel like you have the mindset, for every like you have it 490 00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:40.869 Jenny Duan: within you to like do really? Well, because obviously you've done really well on the math section. You've done really well in the reading section. You've done well on the writing section. You just need to put that all together, and in every single question I think it's the same thing I told you as last time. Just make sure that you approach every single question like it's the only one that matters at the at the time, and do you have some sort of watch? Did you use a watch during the SAT. Did? You were able to see the clock. How did that work? 491 00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:50.050 huda: Yeah, we had like, I saw, like, right in front of the clock. And it was also like digital clocks. So it's like, really easy to read. And I mean, like, how much time I had left. 492 00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:58.749 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this wouldn't be a problem, because you will have, like, obviously, on whatever device you take the psat, you'll have it. But I think that that's 493 00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.559 Jenny Duan: something that you should be mindful of. 494 00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:14.509 Jenny Duan: just making sure that you are able to pace yourself well and allocate enough time for every question. So with the PSAT. Do you know how many questions or how much time you get per section. 495 00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:23.219 huda: II think it's the same, but I'm not sure. I can just check 496 00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.010 Jenny Duan: alright. Thank you. 497 00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:40.399 huda: So 64 min for reading and writing, and 7 70 min to doom the mat section. 498 00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:42.910 Jenny Duan: Well, 499 00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:49.260 Jenny Duan: so. And do you know how many questions there are? Cause. There's 2 sections right? There's like the 500 00:58:49.780 --> 00:59:05.249 Jenny Duan: every the reading, writing, there's like one. And then there's like another one, right? And then all the questions you've looked at a practice test. Right? Yeah. okay, so you're you're familiar with, like, how they structure like the types of questions, how it's like 5 questions of a certain type. And then like 5 questions of another type. 501 00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:07.030 Jenny Duan: right? 502 00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:33.060 huda: which is like weird, in my opinion. But yeah. And then they also don't have like passages, right? It's all like individual. I don't like it like cause I feel like passing. There's so much license cause you like get one passaging like completely understand it well, and then answer the questions, or, like, you know, go back. But whereas, like in the paragraphs, this, I think, was shorter text. You kind of read it more like over and over. So 503 00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:47.769 huda: I don't like. but yeah. and then I heard the digital test like the curve is really bad. So if you get one wrong, you're like already, like 1,500. And then you get another one around like 1480. So 504 00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:48.890 huda: yeah. 505 00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.309 Jenny Duan: okay, but remember the Max score you can get is 1520. So 506 00:59:54.100 --> 01:00:03.450 Jenny Duan: okay, so one mistake overall. 507 01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.570 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 508 01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.030 Jenny Duan: yeah. So. But don't worry about that. When you 509 01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.720 Jenny Duan: take the test like when you take the test, just 510 01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:23.829 Jenny Duan: focus on getting every question right. And I don't think I think the test will be easier than you expect, and if it's harder than you expect, don't worry, because that means every one did bad. 511 01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:46.869 Jenny Duan: You are the curve maker, not the curve breaker. Right? So if you do, if you think it's hard, everyone thinks it's hard, so don't stress. If you think it's hard, it's good, it's better for you. If the test is hard thinking your head that's better for you, because if it's hard, that means that the curve will be better. So more people will get things wrong. But you still won't. You still won't get things wrong. Other people will get things wrong. 512 01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:55.409 Jenny Duan: and they'll make the curve better for you. You're still not gonna get things wrong, regardless if it's hard or easy. So that's the mindset you need to have 513 01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:12.779 huda: on the test. Okay, it's also like it's tomorrow morning. So like I feel like I will. I got to prepare like a whole week before the actual SAT. Cause there's like a break right before it. But now, like all my, you have been continuously prepping 514 01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:19.969 Jenny Duan: for the SHTS. And you've been continuously prepping for the PSAT. On the same in the same way. 515 01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:28.180 huda: True, I guess. Cause this week, like all my teachers, gave us tests. So it's like terrible. So, yeah. 516 01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.769 Jenny Duan: and how are they like? Is it okay? Or 517 01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:46.870 huda: I'd say, like, I know, I got like a 90% on my math. which I'm not really happy about because I needed like a 92 in order to get to keep an A 518 01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:58.880 huda: or to get an A cause. I'm like at 89 point like 9. So it's it's kind of annoying. But I think I could probably make it up on like another test or something. 519 01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.250 Jenny Duan: Okay, you've got this. Keep on working hard. 520 01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.259 huda: Okay, thank you. 521 01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:14.659 huda: okay, yeah. So this tomorrow is my test, and then I'll I'll like, let you know how it goes after. 522 01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:21.039 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm I I'm hoping it goes. Well, I think it will. Don't worry too much. Don't worry too much. 523 01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.600 Jenny Duan: and as long as you have the good SAT. Score. 524 01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.309 huda: Nice. Yeah. 525 01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:53.020 Jenny Duan: Also for you, I think, since we should start thinking about, you know, like finalizing your college list and stuff, I think, once we submit the Nc. Where application, it's time to like start looking and applying for summer programs to. So just wanna put that on your radar that like, that's sort of the direction we're gonna be moving towards. As we wrap up your and see what application. And just, you know, moving to some other application. So 526 01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:00.169 huda: get used to the application period, which means you'll be writing a lot of essays. 527 01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.400 huda: Okay, I think I might be like 528 01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:24.709 huda: taking up too much time, so I think that's all, for now. We could probably set up a meeting like maybe next week. I was thinking on on Sunday we could do a meeting, because I know we usually do 2 meetings a week, and like I've been really busy. So I'm sorry about that. But I'm not done traveling after this week, so we should be back to our normal rhythm. I was thinking 529 01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:41.259 huda: Sunday might be nice, just so we can get head start on like submitting your Nc. Way. Application. Do you think Sunday is a good time for you, or would you prefer to do like Monday or Tuesday instead. I think Monday's better, actually, cause I've like a lot of volunteering to do this weekend, so I don't think I'll be available. 530 01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:50.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool Monday sounds good, then good luck on your PSAT. And let me know how that goes. Bye.",

It's been. 2 00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:25.430 Jenny Duan: It's been a lot. I mean, I'm in Boston right now. But I've also been following like the news about like the Palestine, it's real crisis. And yeah, I'm like, so sorry that that's happening. And like, I've been looking at your stories, too. And like. 3 00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.730 Jenny Duan: I really feel like there's so much suffering out there. And like, it's really like. 4 00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.859 Jenny Duan: yeah, definitely, there's like a lot of like misinformation going around. So 5 00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.970 huda: yeah, it's terrible. 6 00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.600 Jenny Duan: Hmm. alright. So 7 00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:54.429 Jenny Duan: I just wanted to acknowledge that that like that's something I know it's been on your mind. It's on my mind, too. And like. yeah, can't really forget about that going on. 8 00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:06.470 Jenny Duan: okay, so let's just get started. I'm wondering if we can just start with like a quick overview. How is the sat? I feel like I never really got to like debrief that fully with you. How did it go? 9 00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:36.250 huda: So I think initially, my initial thought was, I think I did really well, at least. The reading section went really smoothly for me, cause there weren't any historical passages which meant, like the language was pretty straightforward, and it was kinda easy for me to understand and then also, I guess, English they don't have too many hard concepts on there. But I think I might have gotten one question wrong. 10 00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.049 huda: And then for mask. No calculator, I know for a fact. I got one of the questions wrong. 11 00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:55.870 huda: I'd say, like I did better in reading. At least I think so. But ",
    "I think I didn't do too terribly, at least for the math with calculator. I think I did really well on that one? Yeah. 12 00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.200 Jenny Duan: that's so awesome. When do you get your scores back? 13 00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.449 huda: Next weekend. 14 00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.339 Jenny Duan: Okay? So hopefully, that goes really? Well, 15 00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.510 Jenny Duan: so, yeah. And I fear that you have your PSAT coming up right? 16 00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.520 Yeah. 17 00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:25.990 Jenny Duan: And that's on Monday, right? Or would it be tomorrow? Why is it on the weekend? I've literally never heard of that. It being on a weekend before. I don't know. That's how they do our testing in our school. 18 00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.229 Jenny Duan: Sam, I remember in my high school, like everyone, be well. 19 00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:49.839 Jenny Duan: half of people at my school be really excited because they get like their day off or half of their off because of the standardized testing, and the other half would be super stress, because they would be like, Oh, my gosh! I have standardized testing coming up. So how was that? My school? But that's interesting that they do it on the weekends? I've yeah, not heard of that for 20 00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.039 Jenny Duan: so interesting. 21 00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.610 Jenny Duan: Okay, well. 22 00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.040 Jenny Duan: beyond that, do you have any other updates? How did the filming go? 23 00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:10.639 huda: So one of the people were like out of town. Till the 20 third. Actually. So we weren't able to film. And I'm kind of like. 24 00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.409 huda: I'm trying to get more people. So I have like more like available days. 25 00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.359 huda: And then I got my 26 00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:42.490 huda: like my co like partner. I got her to like agree on the date as well, but like they just, I messaged them. I was like",
    ", okay, so are we set on this day. I finished a script and everything but like they're like, Oh, I'm sorry. Actually, we're out of town until the 20 third, and I was kind of blind sighted cause they told me that they were available. But 27 00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.130 Jenny Duan: yeah. 28 00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:58.320 huda: yeah, I think I'll try to like contact more people so that I'm not like putting all my eggs on one basket and like kind of I'll have like a back up option in case one person isn't available to phone. 29 00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.009 Jenny Duan: You know what would be a really interesting angle for 2 for you. If this 30 00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.170 Jenny Duan: so I feel like the issue right here has been like. 31 00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.820 Jenny Duan: there's not been 32 00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:29.089 Jenny Duan: interviewing people, but I'm wondering like it would be really cool for you to do profiles on like just the Muslim community in general. Right now. Especially because I feel like there's a lot of Islamophobia happening, and there's just like a lot of misinformation in general. So it'd be interesting for you, cause you're interested in journalism to do some like 33 00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:38.540 Jenny Duan: I don't know, like non-biased reporting on the situation. With the Hamas Israel Hamas war or 34 00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.230 Jenny Duan: just like to do some 35 00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.050 Jenny Duan: stories of like 36 00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:55.750 Jenny Duan: the Muslim community in the United States, and like maybe sharing a little bit about that. I don't know if that's too sensitive of a topic, but I do feel like like I would really like to see like in impartial news source, because I feel like all the news I've 37 00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:08.019 Jenny Duan: Fred is really, really biased. And I don't like in one direction or another, and I don't like seeing that, so I don't know. I feel like that would be something to keep in th",
    "e back of your head. 38 00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.520 Jenny Duan: just because I think it's like. 39 00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:16.610 Jenny Duan: first of all, it's necessary. And it's also kind of topical right now. But it's also very sensitive, sensitive topic. So I don't know 40 00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.920 Jenny Duan: lots of things to consider. 41 00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:26.139 huda: So you know what actually I was thinking would kind of be more convenient, for now I think I can start set up, maybe like 42 00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:43.499 huda: articles, maybe about like the small businesses that I'm talking to that way like they could like answer my questions, and I've set up calls with them as well. So I can like write articles about them for now and then, maybe in the future, when they're available, we can start actually filming. 43 00:07:43.930 --> 00:08:03.700 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Cause I don't think it has to be like like, the medium doesn't matter like it's just the message, right? So the message that you're raising awareness. But it could be like it could be like an article. It could be like a newsletter. It could be videos, it could be a podcast it could be. Whatever is easiest for you to produce the content. So all that all that matters is like you have the content out there, so 44 00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:31.569 Jenny Duan: maybe you can just draft up the articles for now and then like leave a couple of spaces in the articles where you can get like quotes from them, or something that will be easier if you could send them like a questionnaire, and they could fill that out instead. I don't know. I did something similar in high school, too. Actually, I did like local journalism, for my neighborhood had their own magazine like a neighborhood publication. So that's actually something you could consider doing. If you feel like your neighborhood would be interested in that 45 00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:42.689 Jenny Duan: the way that works in my neighborhood. I don't know",
    " if your neighborhood has a magazine, but the way that it works in my neighborhood is like we do specific profile stories about, like the different families in the neighborhood 46 00:08:42.690 --> 00:09:02.549 Jenny Duan: and like different events that are happening, you know, at the local high school elementary school, and then local businesses would pay for advertisements in the magazine, and then, you know, the magazine gets sent out every month and would have these like ads from local businesses. And then also, just like the stories of things that are happening in the neighborhood. So that's another 47 00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.639 Jenny Duan: thing to consider. 48 00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.929 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, so 49 00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:21.490 Jenny Duan: I wanted to, just just like, before we get too deep into this today, would you like to focus more on Psat prep, or would you just like to do like the normal like working on your extracurriculars and like everything else? 50 00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:34.479 huda: So since it's kind of like a longer section session. I was kinda hoping we talk about extracurriculars. For, like the most of it, and then maybe a theme, we could just review some like important tips before 51 00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.770 huda: the Psid tomorrow. 52 00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.159 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. 53 00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.910 Jenny Duan: That sounds good. So, okay. 54 00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.419 Jenny Duan: so that's how the film film project is going. How is filmmakers? Club going. 55 00:09:45.910 --> 00:10:02.579 huda: Yeah. So we decided our I don't know if I'll be updated on on this. But we have our new officers. And we decided on our first film project, which is kind of it's kinda Corny. But we're gonna make like a parody of breaking bad. But like. 56 00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:21.030 huda: and obviously, pg, like it's gonna be kinda about like homework or something. And like, we try to to like kinda have like a s",
    "tylistic like, you know how the office has that one like camera like style? Do that? So 57 00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:31.080 huda: yeah. and we're like planning our next meeting to like officiate like this project and then get everyone their roles and everything. So yeah. 58 00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.639 Jenny Duan: okay. that's awesome. 59 00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:43.990 huda: Oh, yeah, also. So remember that. Like professional Instagram. I opened up so like over 60 00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.209 huda: over like last week. I think I posted this like 61 00:10:48.470 --> 00:11:05.239 huda: real Instagram reel is just like that frustrating feeling when you get an error in your code. And then and then I did like in the captions like tips for like debugging your code. And it it didn't get that famous. But I think I got like a hundred like 20 views. But yeah, that's good. 62 00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.930 huda: Yeah. 63 00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.040 Jenny Duan: with the Instagram algorithm discussion. You just need to like 64 00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.049 Jenny Duan: posts like consistently, and then it'll. 65 00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:22.300 Jenny Duan: But that's like the hardest thing is just to like, be consistent with posting. Obviously. Hmm. 66 00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.450 Jenny Duan: yeah. Okay. 67 00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.910 Jenny Duan: okay. 68 00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.280 Jenny Duan: And to start back. 69 00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:40.350 Jenny Duan: And then, okay, full cliff. We already talked about that empowering. A. I. How is that going? 70 00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:54.899 huda: Okay? So empowering? AI, we just finished our first cahu and slides slideshow. I'm almost finished with the second slideshow. Like, we outlined everything we're gonna talk about like for all the meetings 71 00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:16.199 huda: and also. So our web developer like for like, we had this person as a web developer. But she hasn't showed us progress. And like we basically extended her ",
    "week to 2 weeks. So then she didn't do it again. So then, I started working on the website like on web flow, just like kinda have something in the meantime. 72 00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.459 huda: So I'm just trying to like make a note code thing, cause I don't really think we need a 73 00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.250 huda: like a self programmed web site right now. But if we do like. 74 00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:32.679 huda: we'll probably get that resource in the future. We just kind of need something up and running. So I started building that 75 00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.579 huda: I can show you on my screen. Actually. 76 00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.210 huda: So this is kind of 77 00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.679 huda: it's like the home page. 78 00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.440 huda: and then 79 00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.239 Jenny Duan: that looks so good. 80 00:12:51.360 --> 00:13:01.279 huda: Thank you. And then this one, it's like, it's kind of like this stuff is like, obviously not a line to ours, but these are kind of a description for a boot camp. 81 00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.589 huda: And then like, when we have more events and stuff, we can have that 82 00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.729 Jenny Duan: that looks really good. Hooda. Thank you. 83 00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.680 huda: Yeah, that's all for now. But yeah. And then 84 00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:23.069 huda: we just kinda like planned all the slides that we're gonna make like we're doing. The first one's gonna be computer basics. 85 00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:37.229 huda: They learn like, really basic stuff about python like variables and stuff. And then in the second one you learn more about like if statements loops like dictionaries and stuff, and then 86 00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:54.290 huda: kinda like learning more about like specifically how AR works. And then the next meeting, we're gonna talk about like how to make your own AI model. And I actually found, like, I found an idea, for like how we can teach them an AI mode",
    "l like a really simple one. 87 00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:04.649 huda: And then the last one is kind of going to be more about AI ethics and like job opportunities in it. And stuff like that. Yeah. 88 00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:13.050 Jenny Duan: awesome. And I guess, do you have you sent sent out the signup form, how's that going? 89 00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.929 huda: Yeah. So I'm not really sure like. 90 00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:26.240 huda: do you suggest I share it in like like our mountain house, or like our town's Facebook, or cause I don't know if I want to like. 91 00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.160 huda: I don't know if I should go public with it right now, but I don't know. 92 00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.119 huda: What do you suggest? 93 00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.390 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think you should send it out to 94 00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:41.679 Jenny Duan: maybe like like, maybe you can make flyers and put them up in your local library. 95 00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:47.099 Jenny Duan: And maybe you can send them out to like 96 00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:56.160 Jenny Duan: well teachers, because I think that would be a good resource, and they could share with their classes like for middle schoolers or whatever your target audience is. 97 00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.980 huda: That sounds good. Okay. 98 00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:06.799 huda: maybe we could. Also, I think we can work on, maybe sending out like an email to other like middle school people. 99 00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.670 huda: Yeah. 100 00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:25.140 Jenny Duan: okay, that's awesome. That sounds like a good idea. Also, there's like people within your own network, too. your teachers, little schoolers like your own family friends, or people who you think might be interested 101 00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.880 Jenny Duan: and doing this type of thing. That would be a good idea, too. 102 00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.490 Jenny Duan: Alright. 103 00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.609 Jenny Duan: amazing. And then. 104 0",
    "0:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.990 Jenny Duan: in general, how's the game going? Do you have any updates on that. 105 00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:46.670 huda: Yeah. So I think I made a lot of progress on my game. So like I was able to start like 106 00:15:46.830 --> 00:16:12.319 huda: implementing stuff was seen with Ada Lovelace. She's like one of the professors in it. So like I kinda implemented the dialogue really? Well, and I'd say the only thing really left for me to do is just kind of make, I guess the boss's fight, and then kind of the classification model but other than that. I feel like the game is flowing pretty well. 107 00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.769 yeah, I think. 108 00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:25.410 huda: I need to also make more sprites for like different settings. But I think we made like a lot of progress in terms of like the storyline. Yeah. 109 00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:39.839 Jenny Duan: that's really cool. And then how are you like sharing your progress. So I still feel like, like, I want you to have more recognition for this, because I feel like it's super cool. And I want, you know more people to know what it is, and you know, engage with it. 110 00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:49.459 huda: So do you think it's like it would be like wise of me to like like post about it on my professional account. Cause cause. One thing is like there's like 111 00:16:49.550 --> 00:17:07.069 huda: that guy's telling you about who's doing like the boot camps and stuff. He also started like a game development boot camp. So like I don't know if I'm sure I don't know. No, I don't think so. Like. 112 00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:17.249 huda: okay, what I'm confused about is this this guy? He also did like a sat like boot camp thing, even though he didn't take the sat. So I'm I'm not sure 113 00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:23.459 Jenny Duan: I would say, like Block, do you have just? Instagram could just block him like on everything. 114 00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:33.930 Jenny Duan: One person like one negative",
    " person should not disrupt your whole experience like doing something that you truly care about. You know what I mean like, I feel like that shouldn't 115 00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.530 Jenny Duan: be a factor in your life. 116 00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:44.749 huda: Yeah. So do you think I should share it? Or do you think it's like I'm kind of sharing too much? I don't know. 117 00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:56.779 Jenny Duan: Oh, I feel like you should definitely share it like if you're not comfortable with sharing it to a news like to your Instagram, maybe you can like. are there any other like gaming communities or channels that you feel like you could 118 00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.270 Jenny Duan: put it on 119 00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.760 Jenny Duan: like hat club like, are you in the Hat Club slack. I think you should put it in there. 120 00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.149 huda: Okay, that's a good idea. 121 00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.930 Jenny Duan: And like you should 122 00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.560 Jenny Duan: make a website for your game. 123 00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:16.689 Jenny Duan: That's what I think. Like, you should make a website to like, advertise your game. Do you know what I mean? 124 00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:29.470 huda: That's okay. Yeah. I think I can. Do you suggest? Like, I cause I think if I have too many coding projects going on, I think I could just make like a no code website for the for the meantime. 125 00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:34.660 huda: Yeah, it doesn't have to be like a. It could be like a web flow. It could be, you know, like something like that. 126 00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:44.529 Jenny Duan: let me quickly just share my screen. So I can show you like my progress on the game so far. 127 00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:55.320 Jenny Duan: And the website doesn't have to be super complicated, like you can already. You don't have to redesign a template. You could use it in existing template you already have. you know. Okay. that's good. And 128 00:19:00.450 --> 0",
    "0:19:02.090 huda: it's loading. Right? 129 00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.440 Jenny Duan: Wow. 130 00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.169 huda: okay, I don't know why it's looking really blaggy. But 131 00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.990 huda: yeah, 132 00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.790 Jenny Duan: that's so cool. 133 00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.049 huda: I didn't think of the robot's name yet. So 134 00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.970 Jenny Duan: I love it. 135 00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.229 Jenny Duan: That's that's a really good way to teach it. 136 00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.870 huda: Thanks, 137 00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.160 huda: And then this goes back to here. But I'm still like working on 138 00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.040 huda: there's a scene. 139 00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:48.549 huda: it's like the professor's like, kind of 140 00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.399 huda: area. So 141 00:20:53.480 --> 00:21:05.619 huda: that's kinda like what I have right now. I know it's like it doesn't seem long, but like I think it'll all come together. Once I'm finished with the other parts like connecting the other. 142 00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.640 huda: Yeah, I didn't come up with like, dialogue for this one yet. But yeah. 143 00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:17.659 Jenny Duan: yeah, okay, so there's a couple of things that I want to show you. So 144 00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.580 Jenny Duan: first of all, 145 00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.650 Jenny Duan: how is are you planning to apply for the swift student challenge? 146 00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.500 huda: I haven't heard of it. Actually. 147 00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:36.570 Jenny Duan: Okay, it's an apple. It's an apple like It's an apple 148 00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.580 Jenny Duan: like competition where you submit, and 149 00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:46.470 Jenny Duan: you submit like an app of your choice. and 150 00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:52.339 Jenny Duan: yeah, it's pretty cool. You can win like really big prizes and win recognition for your work. 151 00:21:52.390 --> 00:2",
    "1:55.079 Jenny Duan: So it's 152 00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:07.440 Jenny Duan: in an app playground that can be experienced with 3 within 3 min. So like, do you know what an app playground is? It's I think it's just like a model demo app like thing that apple made. 153 00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.510 Jenny Duan: But I 154 00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.409 Jenny Duan: but there's a couple things that I want to show you 155 00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:17.900 Jenny Duan: that I think would be really cool for you. So New York University has this 156 00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.920 Jenny Duan: summer program. 157 00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.020 Jenny Duan: so yeah. 158 00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:36.339 Jenny Duan: called the Tish summer game design program. That might be really cool for you. It's a 4 week class, and you can go to Nyu and like, learn how to build games. 159 00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:53.619 Jenny Duan: That's pretty cool. You take courses at Nyu. That might be interesting. That's cool. Carnegie Mellon also has national high school game Academy. and yeah, you can apply in visual arts, music and audio game design and software development. 160 00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.030 Jenny Duan: Just pretty cool. 161 00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.049 Jenny Duan: yeah, there's that 162 00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:07.450 Jenny Duan: so soon. Challenge. I'll put all these in your tracker later for you to look at, hey? This now for some competitions. 163 00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.970 Jenny Duan: I think these are really cool national stem video game challenge. 164 00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:25.369 Jenny Duan: I don't know if this is like still going on, because they haven't posted anything since 2,017. But if it is still going on. this will be really cool for you, too. 165 00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:33.200 Jenny Duan: That's interesting. But they haven't updated since 2017. 166 00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.240 Jenny Duan: But maybe that was the last competition they had. 167 00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.890 Jenny Duan: Ye",
    "ah, I don't know. 168 00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:43.600 Jenny Duan: But 169 00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:59.400 Jenny Duan: alright whatever. But this is cool games for change. Student challenge. I think this would be really cool for you. I was looking at this, too. It's a non profit where you it's a national game development challenge. And if you win, you get a $10,000 scholarship 170 00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:15.490 Jenny Duan: and let me show you it's supposed to be games for social change. So that's why I thought yours would be a really good fit, because yours is about, you know, social change. So we we can play some of these games. What do you think? Which one do you want to play climate action heroes give these a chance. 171 00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:22.269 Jenny Duan: Positive play. game accessibility challenge? Oh, these are just the challenges. 172 00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.940 huda: maybe 173 00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.620 Jenny Duan: give peace a chance. Okay. 174 00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:34.299 Jenny Duan: so let's just see what these games look like. These are other student games. Obviously. 175 00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.799 Jenny Duan: I'm actually here. Is this taking a long time to load? 176 00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.250 Jenny Duan: Okay? 177 00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:51.490 Jenny Duan: Oh, this is the category. Okay, this is not the game name. This is the category. Which one do you wanna play? 178 00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.759 huda: stash the trash. 179 00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.779 Jenny Duan: Let's see actually who created this. 180 00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:06.190 Jenny Duan: Oh, here, this is elementary school that's so cool. They made it with blocksels. 181 00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.870 Jenny Duan: Okay. But obviously, you know. 182 00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.129 Jenny Duan: people make these in. This is 183 00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.889 Jenny Duan: school of medicine. I think this is a college. This is a high school. 184 00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.880 Jenny Duan: Obviou",
    "sly, like you middle school, there's different. 185 00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.230 Jenny Duan: obviously, there's like different 186 00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.059 Jenny Duan: category. So yeah, but dash the trash! This is made by a 187 00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.210 Jenny Duan: elementary school.

Or and taking a central role majoring in computer science in college. 325 00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.000 Jenny Duan: And then taking. 326 00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:12.310 Jenny Duan: Oh. or, yeah, to take. that's fine 327 00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:19.320 huda: and trouble in shaping the tech industry's work force as a game developer. 328 00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:24.060 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can just say, shaping the tech industry.

    "43.780 Jenny Duan: is that some video games, maybe not violent because they some video games. 359 00:41:45.600 --> 00:42:00.570 Jenny Duan: And I don't know how many words you have. If you have extra words you can maybe write about, you know, to day like the most popular video games are like first person shooter games. But you see a world in which, like the most popular video games, are ones that are focused on education and social good. 360 00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:07.520 huda: Yeah, someone's really fun. They can be fun to play. But also, you know, like providing some type of benefit to the world. 361 00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:16.000 huda: Yeah. I think I'm gonna talk a bit more about like. And yeah, like, kind of how I think that 362 00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:31.210 huda: kinda educational games are kind of the best of both worlds. And they're kinda like teach something, and especially have a great influence on younger audiences and kind of at the same time, they're fun. So I think that's kind of what I'm talk, gonna talk about 363 00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.800 huda: pounds. Yeah. 364 00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:41.110 Jenny Duan: Sounds perfect. Okay, cool. And then what about your first essay? Describe your journey about technology? 365 00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:46.079 Jenny Duan: Oh, I think this is the one we talked about earlier. 366 00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.540 Is this 250 words? 367 00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.750 huda: Yeah. 368 00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:59.660 huda: think so. 369 00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:09.390 Jenny Duan: Okay, I think you should extend the last paragraph a little bit, because it sounds like it's a little cut off. Do you see what I mean? 370 00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.480 Jenny Duan: What is the prompt? Can we look at that again? 371 00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:28.799 huda: I was just on describe your journey. Okay. 372 00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.149 Jenny Duan: okay, so can we go back to yours? 373 00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:35.970 Jenny Duan: Questions? 374 00:43:37.",
    "610 --> 00:43:52.350 Jenny Duan: okay, what about it? By the desire? I said. during the process of developing in a I education game on Youtube. I also found a number of profit just like my 7 year old self to pursue their technology dreams. 375 00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.299 Jenny Duan: and maybe you can add, like one more sentence about how you see technology like 376 00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:07.579 Jenny Duan: how you see it influencing your life today. Maybe you can say like today, like I, you know, hope to XYZ. 377 00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.830 Jenny Duan: Interested in what you know that type of thing. 378 00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:16.570 huda: Do you think I should write like a sentence. Maybe like like 379 00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:20.960 huda: technology became less of a mysterious 380 00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:27.850 huda: figure to me and and and evolved into a tool that allowed me to express myself. 381 00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.969 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and also help other people in the process. 382 00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.610 huda: Yeah. 383 00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.040 Jenny Duan: perfect. 384 00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:05.870 huda: Let me just see. 385 00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.289 huda: Okay, it's still under yeah. 386 00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.729 huda: 2 50 387 00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:13.610 Jenny Duan: awesome. 388 00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.579 Jenny Duan: I don't think I wouldn't say like technology was once a mysterious figure. 389 00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:37.099 huda: I kind of emphasize, because in the beginning I used to only see as like a sci-fi kinda like like a far like kinda distant thing. But it kind of like influenced my life all aspects of my life and kind of show that 390 00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:42.350 huda: kind of like it was different to me. But now it's like part of me, I guess. 391 00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.709 Jenny Duan: Okay, is there a way we can 392 00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.420 Jenny Duan: rephrase that last sentence 393 00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:5",
    "3.640 huda: technology one. 394 00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:03.529 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can say today, I no longer. New technology has a 395 00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:11.600 Jenny Duan: I'm writing a sentence in the chat right now. So I no longer view technology as a sci-fi 396 00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:18.180 Jenny Duan: superpower, fantasy, mystery. 397 00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:27.529 Jenny Duan: mystery, but rather as a powerful tool. But 398 00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:35.320 Jenny Duan: no April's meeting to express myself and 399 00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:40.409 Jenny Duan: empower others in the conference. 400 00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:56.480 huda: Did you say, like technology evolve, evolved from 401 00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:05.000 huda: from a sci-fi fantasy into a powerful tool like, I think the evolved wording kind of 402 00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:06.570 huda: I like things 403 00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:15.659 huda: are. I think it's, I think. actually, the sentence in the chat is kind of more better, because 404 00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:23.610 huda: because that way. I kinda show that it's how I view it, not the technology, I guess. 405 00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.210 Jenny Duan: Hmm. 406 00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.980 huda: let me just see. 407 00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.520 huda: Okay, that's one word over. So 408 00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.400 Jenny Duan: maybe you can just cut. 409 00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:12.529 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can just say I had only ever seen in sci-fi mood. please. I don't think you need the before. 410 00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:18.009 Jenny Duan: because you'd only ever seen the first paragraph. 411 00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:26.680 Jenny Duan: something you'd only ever seen in sci-fi movies. You'll need the before, because the only ever seen already implies that before. Does that make sense. 412 00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.560 huda: Hmm. 413 00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:39.979 huda: I don't think I used before actually in sci fi movies before it's the word after movies. Oh, o",
    "kay, sorry. There you go now, are you done with the word out? 414 00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:42.990 huda: Yeah. 415 00:48:43.540 --> 00:49:00.789 Jenny Duan: okay, I feel like this is looking good. I think after you finish the last one we can go over that one more time, and then you should be able to honestly submit it. At that point. We're not missing anything else right for this. Let me just show you my application. 416 00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:13.939 Jenny Duan: And also like it's option optional. But you can also, like provide like some links of your project. So that's a perfect opportunity. You have so many, you have so many projects. Right? That's perfect. 417 00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:18.520 huda: Okay, let me just share, like what I put on here. 418 00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.270 Jenny Duan: I'm really happy with your writing today. I feel like your writing quality has improved a lot. 419 00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:26.590 huda: Thank you. 420 00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:30.029 Jenny Duan: Oh, yeah. 421 00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.940 huda: sorry. So this is like, the 422 00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:41.269 Jenny Duan: I would add a parentheses after every one of these and say what it is. For example, you should say, 423 00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:56.870 Jenny Duan: job board job board. I developed. For I I'm just saying words you don't have to for my for the unemployment. 424 00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:57.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 425 00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.230 Jenny Duan: in my community. 426 00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:11.350 Jenny Duan: And then what did you use to develop it with. I use react. I developed with react. 427 00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.620 Jenny Duan: oh, or using react? Yeah, that's 428 00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.279 Jenny Duan: okay. And then 429 00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:33.040 huda: this is like, I mean, like a von I wouldn't put a dash. I would just put the parentheses, because when they're copy paste they might copy, paste the dash in. Oh, okay, and this is. Oh. 430 00:50:34.440 --",
    "> 00:50:38.010 Jenny Duan: is there a way you could show it without the Github login. 431 00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:43.470 huda: I think. Wait! I might have put the wrong link. Wait. 432 00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.539 huda: I'm glad I checked that 433 00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.529 Jenny Duan: it's all good. 434 00:50:48.390 --> 00:51:05.439 huda: Let me just oh, basically it's on like a volunteering, website, where like, you put in like your location and or like your right now, it's kinda only in la area. But you've like put in your location, and then it gives you 435 00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:13.240 huda: It gives you like opportunities near you with like links and stuff. And we use like an Api to make it so. 436 00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.050 huda: And 437 00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:21.470 huda: is this the same thing? 438 00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:26.939 I think so. 439 00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:35.700 huda: Oh, no!

I usually publish my code like like 451 00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.870 huda: on here on netify 452 00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:56.090 Jenny Duan: How come it d",
    "oesn't? The link doesn't link. It was it was working a couple of days ago when I was entering it. But 453 00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:58.569 huda: I'm not sure. 454 00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:09.240 huda: yeah, okay, I could just use something different then. 455 00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.890 huda: I have a few other things I can put. 456 00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:22.080 huda: I have like 457 00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:31.810 huda: this project is called Netiverse. It was for a hackathon. And basically it was like you should just put the you should put the link to the 458 00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.090 Jenny Duan: nullify and try. Try one more time. 459 00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:44.240 Jenny Duan: Working on my other account, either. Now. is it because of Netlifi like? Is there something wrong with that? 460 00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:50.130 huda: I am not entirely sure but this one's like a different project that I did have. 461 00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:59.819 Jenny Duan: you should put that, too. 462 00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:03.760 Jenny Duan: And then oh, maybe you can put like a. 463 00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:06.959 Jenny Duan: Maybe you can put like screenshots like. 464 00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:17.169 Jenny Duan: why don't you make a Google presentation? Take screenshots of your other like a Google slides. Take screenshots of your netlify one and put just put like screenshots in. 465 00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:28.670 Jenny Duan: And then like and like types, a little bit of text. This shouldn't take you too long. Type a little text like explaining how each page works, and then just link the drive. That should be good if if the network doesn't work cause, I don't want you to. 466 00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:33.259 Jenny Duan: I don't want you to just like not be able to show that, you know. 467 00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:38.200 huda: Yeah. And this is the one that has a chat box. So and 468 00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:41.120 huda: take 469 00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.630 huda: this. 470 00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:58.",
    "939 huda: yeah, there's like. and was just something that I worked on like a couple like 2 years ago. 471 00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.360 huda: I mean. 472 00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:08.990 huda: yeah. 473 00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:21.430 Jenny Duan: that looks really good. I love the Chatbot feature. Thank you. How did you make that? That's so cool? It was like, there's like this, land like Api thing like, Oh, cool! 474 00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:30.250 huda: It's not honestly, not that complex which is kind of I don't know if I should share this. But yeah. 475 00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:35.320 Jenny Duan: you should share share anything that you can, and share as much as you can. 476 00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:40.840 huda: And then you could just like this one just really basic. But like, say, you like, measure like your 477 00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:44.300 huda: Rp, and it's like. like, really high. 478 00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.750 Jenny Duan: that's really cool try again, or get modified attention 479 00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.150 huda: like, if you do like 10 or something, this is the same thing. 480 00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.160 huda: Maybe it'll just 481 00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:01.339 huda: it's just gonna be normal. But yeah. 482 00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:07.320 huda: I'm trying to think of any other projects that I did 483 00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:15.040 huda: registered on like entering these now. 484 00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.070 huda: but we obviously for these together. So 485 00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:30.450 huda: yeah, I'll like, I'll let you know like which which, like a lynx, I end up putting on here. So 486 00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:43.009 Jenny Duan: okay, so can we just like go over like some tips, maybe on the pst right now. So I think the main thing is just having your 487 00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:53.739 Jenny Duan: confidence ready. And then also like being adjusted to the online format. So I mean, I think. how did you like go into the sat? And how did you feel when you were goin",
    "g in? 488 00:56:54.380 --> 00:57:04.079 huda: I think I was like really nervous for the SAT. But honestly, I was trying not to think about it on the way there, but after I felt kind of good about it. 489 00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:17.480 huda: cause us kinda do like a slower pace, but like still understanding everything that's really good. I feel like that's kind of the mindset. I feel like you have the mindset, for every like you have it 490 00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:40.869 Jenny Duan: within you to like do really? Well, because obviously you've done really well on the math section. You've done really well in the reading section. You've done well on the writing section. You just need to put that all together, and in every single question I think it's the same thing I told you as last time. Just make sure that you approach every single question like it's the only one that matters at the at the time, and do you have some sort of watch? Did you use a watch during the SAT. Did? You were able to see the clock. How did that work? 491 00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:50.050 huda: Yeah, we had like, I saw, like, right in front of the clock. And it was also like digital clocks. So it's like, really easy to read. And I mean, like, how much time I had left. 492 00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:58.749 Jenny Duan: Yeah, this wouldn't be a problem, because you will have, like, obviously, on whatever device you take the psat, you'll have it. But I think that that's 493 00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.559 Jenny Duan: something that you should be mindful of. 494 00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:14.509 Jenny Duan: just making sure that you are able to pace yourself well and allocate enough time for every question. So with the PSAT. Do you know how many questions or how much time you get per section. 495 00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:23.219 huda: II think it's the same, but I'm not sure. I can just check 496 00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.010 Jenny Duan: alright. Thank you. 497 00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:40.399 huda: So 64 min for reading an",
    "d writing, and 7 70 min to doom the mat section. 498 00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:42.910 Jenny Duan: Well, 499 00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:49.260 Jenny Duan: so. And do you know how many questions there are? Cause. There's 2 sections right? There's like the 500 00:58:49.780 --> 00:59:05.249 Jenny Duan: every the reading, writing, there's like one. And then there's like another one, right? And then all the questions you've looked at a practice test. Right? Yeah. okay, so you're you're familiar with, like, how they structure like the types of questions, how it's like 5 questions of a certain type. And then like 5 questions of another type. 501 00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:07.030 Jenny Duan: right? 502 00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:33.060 huda: which is like weird, in my opinion. But yeah. And then they also don't have like passages, right? It's all like individual. I don't like it like cause I feel like passing. There's so much license cause you like get one passaging like completely understand it well, and then answer the questions, or, like, you know, go back. But whereas, like in the paragraphs, this, I think, was shorter text. You kind of read it more like over and over. So 503 00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:47.769 huda: I don't like. but yeah. and then I heard the digital test like the curve is really bad. So if you get one wrong, you're like already, like 1,500. And then you get another one around like 1480. So 504 00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:48.890 huda: yeah. 505 00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.309 Jenny Duan: okay, but remember the Max score you can get is 1520. So 506 00:59:54.100 --> 01:00:03.450 Jenny Duan: okay, so one mistake overall. 507 01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.570 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 508 01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.030 Jenny Duan: yeah. So. But don't worry about that. When you 509 01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.720 Jenny Duan: take the test like when you take the test, just 510 01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:23.829 Jenny Duan: focus on getting every question right. And I don't think I think the test will be e",
    "asier than you expect, and if it's harder than you expect, don't worry, because that means every one did bad. 511 01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:46.869 Jenny Duan: You are the curve maker, not the curve breaker. Right? So if you do, if you think it's hard, everyone thinks it's hard, so don't stress. If you think it's hard, it's good, it's better for you. If the test is hard thinking your head that's better for you, because if it's hard, that means that the curve will be better. So more people will get things wrong. But you still won't. You still won't get things wrong. Other people will get things wrong. 512 01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:55.409 Jenny Duan: and they'll make the curve better for you. You're still not gonna get things wrong, regardless if it's hard or easy. So that's the mindset you need to have 513 01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:12.779 huda: on the test. Okay, it's also like it's tomorrow morning. So like I feel like I will. I got to prepare like a whole week before the actual SAT. Cause there's like a break right before it. But now, like all my, you have been continuously prepping 514 01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:19.969 Jenny Duan: for the SHTS. And you've been continuously prepping for the PSAT. On the same in the same way. 515 01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:28.180 huda: True, I guess. Cause this week, like all my teachers, gave us tests. So it's like terrible. So, yeah. 516 01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.769 Jenny Duan: and how are they like? Is it okay? Or 517 01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:46.870 huda: I'd say, like, I know, I got like a 90% on my math. which I'm not really happy about because I needed like a 92 in order to get to keep an A 518 01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:58.880 huda: or to get an A cause. I'm like at 89 point like 9. So it's it's kind of annoying. But I think I could probably make it up on like another test or something. 519 01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.250 Jenny Duan: Okay, you've got this. Keep on working hard. 520 01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.259 huda: Okay, thank you. 521 01:02:05.460",
    " --> 01:02:14.659 huda: okay, yeah. So this tomorrow is my test, and then I'll I'll like, let you know how it goes after. 522 01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:21.039 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I'm I I'm hoping it goes. Well, I think it will. Don't worry too much. Don't worry too much. 523 01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.600 Jenny Duan: and as long as you have the good SAT. Score. 524 01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.309 huda: Nice. Yeah. 525 01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:53.020 Jenny Duan: Also for you, I think, since we should start thinking about, you know, like finalizing your college list and stuff, I think, once we submit the Nc. Where application, it's time to like start looking and applying for summer programs to. So just wanna put that on your radar that like, that's sort of the direction we're gonna be moving towards. As we wrap up your and see what application. And just, you know, moving to some other application. So 526 01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:00.169 huda: get used to the application period, which means you'll be writing a lot of essays. 527 01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.400 huda: Okay, I think I might be like 528 01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:24.709 huda: taking up too much time, so I think that's all, for now. We could probably set up a meeting like maybe next week. I was thinking on on Sunday we could do a meeting, because I know we usually do 2 meetings a week, and like I've been really busy. So I'm sorry about that. But I'm not done traveling after this week, so we should be back to our normal rhythm. I was thinking 529 01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:41.259 huda: Sunday might be nice, just so we can get head start on like submitting your Nc. Way. Application. Do you think Sunday is a good time for you, or would you prefer to do like Monday or Tuesday instead. I think Monday's better, actually, cause I've like a lot of volunteering to do this weekend, so I don't think I'll be available. 530 01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:50.600 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool Monday sounds good, then good luck on your PSAT. And let me know ho",
