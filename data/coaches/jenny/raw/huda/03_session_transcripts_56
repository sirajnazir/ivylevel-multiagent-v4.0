How's it going. 2 00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.490 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.150 Jenny Duan: How was I'm good? How was the final day of Kurtu's policy? 4 00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.289 huda: There's actually one more day but we. 5 00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.840 Jenny Duan: All right with tomorrow. 6 00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.749 huda: Thing. So yeah, it's going pretty well. 7 00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:13.140 Jenny Duan: Are? Is your team done with your project? 8 00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.049 huda: Yeah, we're done. We just need to do a little bit of practice and everything. But yeah. 9 00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.137 Jenny Duan: Can you tell me like how it went like 10 00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.200 Jenny Duan: How did everything go overall like? What were the tools you use? And like was the end result. What you wanted. 11 00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:57.809 huda: Yeah, so I definitely, we definitely had like a lot of problems. So we wanted to make like a resource or like, give, like, data about how much, how like the correlation between like people's access to computers, and then like like the amount of income that they have and like, especially in like 3rd World countries. And then that way, we wanted to like urge people to like donate to computer accessibility and 12 00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:26.739 huda: those places. So that's what our product was. And then so we made like a website, where that you could like donate. And then, like view statistics. We just use Google sites. So Ca, so it's like easy. And we could all work on it at once. And and we spent like a bulk of the time doing like research about like which data sets to use. And then, like like, kind of finding data sets that show the correlation best. And then we also. 13 00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:45.089 huda: we used this thing called Google colab to like kind of code. Coded like a visualization of the data. But like it didn't really like look appealing and like you couldn't read it at all. So we just ended up using like Google, I think it was Google notebook. 14 00:06:45.533 --> 00:07:03.746 huda: So like, make the statistics but still turn out really good. Good. And then, yeah, like, right now, we're just working on like, like our demo, like our pitch, like slide, I guess. And then, yeah, I think it's going well, we definitely have to settle a few times. 15 00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:11.919 huda: because, like, we didn't have like the technical ability to. But yeah, I think it's I think it's good. For, like the time we had. 16 00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.230 Jenny Duan: Can I see it? Do you have like a demo. 17 00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.020 huda: Yeah. 18 00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:19.640 huda: let me. 19 00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.990 huda: It's cool computers for everyone. 20 00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.600 Jenny Duan: Wow! It looks really cool. 21 00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:48.540 huda: Cute and then we have, like a donate now thing where it has like different organizations. And then this is the tab that I mainly worked on data visualization. 22 00:07:49.064 --> 00:07:50.840 huda: and it was like. 23 00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.320 Jenny Duan: Looks really good. 24 00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.080 huda: Thank you. There's like a map. There's like online graph. 25 00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.860 huda: And so you could kind of see the correlation. But yeah. 26 00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.810 Jenny Duan: Looks really good. How does this make you feel about like data science? And in that subject. 27 00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:25.209 huda: I think it was really cool. It was definitely like a lot easier than I expected. Like especially with SQL, because I never. I didn't know. SQL, and I kind of thought it was a super hard like language, which I'm sure it is, but like from what I know, like. It's not as like 28 00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:28.299 huda: scary is like what I thought. 29 00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:38.209 Jenny Duan: Amazing. Well, I'm glad that went really. Well. Other than that like, do you have any other updates on things that you've been working on. 30 00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:54.109 huda: Yeah, I have like a couple of updates, actually, so, so through nc, we're actually someone contacted me like, someone on the slack posted like they're looking for some of the Nc. What? Like high school members to join a panel 31 00:08:54.109 --> 00:09:10.459 huda: of speakers for like an educator event, and so we can kinda give kind of like, yeah, like our opinion about like technology and classrooms and stuff like that. And so I reply, and I was like, I'm really interested. And so I'm meeting with them tomorrow morning to like kind of go over like 32 00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:29.359 huda: it's like our initial meeting. To see, like to plan out the logistics and everything. And then I told them that I have to like record, that I'm available through like a recording, because at that time I'm gonna be in Jcm for yeah, I'm gonna be in Jcm, so I won't be able to attend it virtually. But yeah. And then I think. 33 00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.089 Jenny Duan: Time you might be able to. 34 00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.069 Jenny Duan: What time would it be. 35 00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.295 huda: I think it's like in the morning slash like afternoon. 36 00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.000 Jenny Duan: Like you can still find time like, and Jake can't do it. 37 00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:51.089 huda: I guess, like I'm not sure how Jim packed this cause it cause during like the orientation for J. Camp, they said we'd be busy like the entire day, and just have like like 38 00:09:51.220 --> 00:10:14.639 huda: at night to kind of chill. But yeah, I know, like they they were deciding. Like to begin with, they're like, Oh, we don't know if we want to do like a live panel, or if we want to do recorded. And I said, oh, I think recorded would be a great option that way. We can have like more information and stuff. But I'm happy to like cooperate. And then, yeah. So we're we're kind of deciding that. And then, like, I'm meeting with them tomorrow morning. 39 00:10:14.994 --> 00:10:17.059 huda: To like discuss stuff like that. 40 00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.079 Jenny Duan: How do they say that they found you again. 41 00:10:19.748 --> 00:10:21.480 huda: Do that and see what slack. 42 00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.650 Jenny Duan: Cool 43 00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.119 Jenny Duan: and like, how do they like isolate you versus other people? Did they say that. 44 00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:45.620 huda: I think everyone who kinda like it was like like someone like the organizer. She posted it on like the slack. And then I like, replied was like, Oh, I'd definitely be interested. And then, like a few other girls also, replied that they were interested. 45 00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.110 Jenny Duan: Oh, gotcha! 46 00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.240 huda: Yeah. So like they like contacted us and everything. 47 00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.329 Jenny Duan: Any other updates. 48 00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:16.597 huda: Yeah, so actually with empower AI so last time I told you that we're like hosting a hackathon. There's actually some exciting news. I got 2 sponsors for for heather hackathon. It's a wolfram and dot xyz, and so they're like they have, like a lot of prizes for 49 00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.100 Jenny Duan: Pause, pause. How did you get these sponsors? Those are some pretty big names. 50 00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:43.842 huda: I email them. And like I was like, Hey, I'm from this hackathon like, I'm like organizing this hackathon. It's gonna be virtual and like we'd really love for your with your support for sponsorship. And even if you're not able to like sponsor Hackathon like we just love free to be involved. And then like, both of them replied, and they were like, Oh, we'd love. 51 00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.239 Jenny Duan: Amazing. That's amazing. Yeah. 52 00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:54.284 huda: Thank you. Yeah. And then we haven't really started advertising. But we already have, like 5 people who signed up 53 00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:11.360 huda: and so I think this is going pretty well. We've we've like kind of started advertising, but like I think, I I made like a kind of like a advertising plan for my social media marketers like with a bunch of like Instagram post ideas and like say, Talk post ideas. 54 00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:31.796 huda: and like kind of and so like, especially now that I'm gonna be going to London, and I might be busy like she'll definitely be able to cover that cause. I gave her a lot of resources. But yeah. And then, we're also trying to. And also, yeah, I got a judge for empower hacks as well. 55 00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.550 huda: she's a product at. 56 00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.868 huda: I'm like a product manager at 57 00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.649 huda: I forgot which company I think it was like Amazon, or something like that 58 00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:53.149 huda: or no. It was something. It was like Microsoft, or something like it was like a big tech company. And so yeah, so she's gonna be a judge. And then I also reached out to. 59 00:12:53.150 --> 00:13:00.070 Jenny Duan: Molly, how did you get like this is huge congrats on all the progress? Tell me more about how like all of this is coming to be. 60 00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.563 huda: So actually, 61 00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:22.489 huda: So the judge I actually like. A while ago I reached out to her cause. I wanted to do like a speaker event through Instagram, like I reached out to her on Instagram, and then we never got to do that event, because I guess, like she never sent over the information about like the slides and everything. So then I just reached out to her recently. And I was like. 62 00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:42.830 huda: Hey, we're running this hackathon. It's about like increasing like the platform for women in stem. Fe in the stem field. We'd love for you to be a judge. And if possible, even like do a panel and then she said, Oh, I'd be happy to judge so like that's how we got her involvement. 63 00:13:43.316 --> 00:13:44.210 huda: So yeah. 64 00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.313 huda: And then 65 00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.798 huda: also, like, on on the empowering Instagram. 66 00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.029 huda: we hit like 280 followers, and we're still. 67 00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.180 Jenny Duan: Sure app. 68 00:13:56.532 --> 00:13:58.640 huda: Yeah. And so. 69 00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.880 huda: okay? And then, we reached out to another nonprofit that we follow. 70 00:14:04.205 --> 00:14:15.264 huda: I think they do like sustainability, like tech and stuff like that and then we reached out, and then I asked if they'd be interested in like running a workshop in our hackathon. 71 00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.390 huda: And then I kind of like made a document with like a few plans that I had and then like 72 00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:31.260 huda: and then they like looked at the document, said, Oh, we'd love to do the 1st one. So now they're gonna like, make the slides and do like a workshop in our hackathon. And then I'm gonna try and get 73 00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.409 huda: a few more nonprofits to do the same thing that way. We'll have like a bunch of 74 00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.670 huda: workshops. 75 00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:56.370 huda: And additionally, I'm trying to get a few more judges or like panelists. So in the women and games discord, I've been trying to like. Ask other ambassadors if they'd be interested in like judging or being a panelist. But yeah, like, not too much engagement there. But yeah. 76 00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:07.169 Jenny Duan: Wait. That's huge. 50, $13,000 in sponsors is amazing. Can you tell me a bit more about about that? Like, what are they exactly sponsoring. 77 00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:20.869 huda: Yeah, so Wolfram is like providing everyone who everyone who participates with a I think it was 30 day subscription to Wolfram, which is like, I think, $25 worth. 78 00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.979 huda: And then and then I think 79 00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.430 huda: they're also allowing the top 80 00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:49.729 huda: 5 followers or top 5 like participants to get like the Wolfarm, like professional subscription for I think, a year, and also they're eligible, for, like one of their scholars, like $500 scholarships, they can apply for that if they win, and they also receive like a certificate from them, which is also high value. 81 00:15:50.308 --> 00:15:57.489 huda: And then with the Xyz they're providing 15 domains to everyone, which I think was 82 00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.139 huda: $10 in value. But yeah. 83 00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.249 Jenny Duan: Wait. So where does the rest of the 13,000 come from? The. 84 00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.369 huda: The 13,000. 85 00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.980 huda: Yeah, it's like the value of the of like the subscriptions and everything. 86 00:16:11.407 --> 00:16:17.599 huda: Yeah. So we're trying to like, have some more like practical prizes like keyboards, or like 87 00:16:18.056 --> 00:16:23.269 huda: maybe like a camera, or some like a small camera or something like that. But yeah. 88 00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:29.259 huda: I think, for now we're trying to get more sponsors. Cause like a lot of the hackathons have a lot of sponsors. 89 00:16:29.634 --> 00:16:32.540 huda: But yeah, I think a little more cold mailing might help. 90 00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.143 Jenny Duan: That's still really awesome that you were able to get them to sign on. I think that that's like 91 00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:46.930 Jenny Duan: very impressive thing, and it seems like that's gonna be good for attracting traction. How many people are signed up? Total right? Or have you started distributing yet? 92 00:16:47.811 --> 00:17:07.029 huda: We just kind of just started distributing, but kind of minimally. And we already have like 6 to 7 signups. And they're from like like around the world like I saw. There's someone from France. There's someone from Canada. There's like a bunch of people from America like I think it's it's pretty national right now. 93 00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.029 Jenny Duan: That's awesome. 94 00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:16.488 Jenny Duan: And for your sign ups like, or sorry for the organization of the hackathon. 95 00:17:17.149 --> 00:17:18.259 Jenny Duan: how does 96 00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:23.229 Jenny Duan: how like? How does the programming work. What kinds of events are you planning as of right now? 97 00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:38.280 huda: Yeah. So right now, I'm like, kind of planning, like an opening ceremony where? We kind of introduce, like us the board members where they can like come and contact us for anything, and then we introduce the judges 98 00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:48.420 huda: and then, like the theme and everything, and then also like, say, like the schedule and then after that, there's gonna be like a couple I wanna do like 99 00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:56.192 huda: 2 to 3 workshops in the 1st day, and then, like maybe like 2 or one workshop the second day 100 00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:22.490 huda: which I think like the best way to like get workshops is through like other nonprofits, cause they're pretty like eager about it. But yeah, them. And then I also wanted to have like a panelist type thing. So if we do get a couple more judges they could like have like a panel, and then that way, like the people who are competing can also, like introduce themselves to the judges, and then also, like kind of 101 00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:29.450 huda: they could talk about their journey as like a woman in stem and stuff like that. So I think that's like how we want to do it. 102 00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:54.230 huda: And then the judges, like they have, like like a rubric on dev post where they can like choose, like they can like kind of grade each project. And then we wanna we wanna set up like a few themes. And then we also we wanna publicize this a lot. So I'm giving like the social media manager, like lots of responsibility. And so I'm asking her to like. 103 00:18:54.230 --> 00:19:08.539 huda: kind of go around like, get screen recordings of like testimonials and like people in action. So that way, we can, like, you know, have like lots of Tiktoks and like Youtube videos about it. And also just like pictures, so that we can like distribute it on our site. 104 00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:22.347 huda: and then. I was thinking of doing something like a fun theme like who has the most creative, like Tiktok about the hackathon or something, and that could have like a prize category. 105 00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:28.060 huda: and then, yeah, it's gonna be from July 20th to 21st 106 00:19:28.763 --> 00:19:29.690 huda: and like. 107 00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.970 Jenny Duan: Good that you're planning so far in advance. 108 00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.719 huda: Yeah, I wanna I wanna cause I know hackathons usually take. 109 00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:43.320 huda: for like professional hackathons, they take like 2 months. But like since we're kind of short on time. I wanna do like in a month. 110 00:19:43.756 --> 00:19:52.180 huda: But yeah, and then I think this is gonna drive our engagement the most from, like all our events. So far. So, yeah. 111 00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.570 Jenny Duan: Awesome and then 112 00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:02.400 Jenny Duan: I was just gonna ask, like, how many people is your target goal for the hackathon? And like how many people are on the organization team. 113 00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.169 huda: Right now. It's just the 5 of us 114 00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.350 huda: but in my goal. So most hackathons have, like like 115 00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:20.474 huda: around like 400 people. But I'm aiming for like 200 people to join just as like a baseline. But 116 00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.740 huda: yeah. 117 00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:26.219 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Can you? Do you have a zoom pro plan that accommodates so many. 118 00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:29.384 huda: We we're planning to hold it on discord. 119 00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:30.550 Jenny Duan: Very cool. 120 00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:37.749 huda: Yeah, so we can like present. And then we can have like different channels. For, like the different workshops and such, and so on. 121 00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.929 Jenny Duan: Cool? Why discord versus another platform? Just curious. 122 00:20:43.614 --> 00:20:53.989 huda: I feel like it's really like everything in one place, because that's we're gonna where, like, we already have a discord for the hackathon where? That's where they gonna have like questions. 123 00:20:54.307 --> 00:21:08.110 huda: That's where I don't know. They can like join our workshops stuff. So I was thinking, like if we just have, like all our like kind of meetings and calls and stuff there, it'll just be a lot more easier to like. Keep up with. 124 00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.935 Jenny Duan: Alright! Got it? 125 00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:17.319 Jenny Duan: That's super cool, and then have the other people on your team been responsive in planning and helping. 126 00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:32.055 huda: So far we've like I kind of. We've kind of been taking it lightly. But then yesterday I set us up on dev post, and like got the sponsors and everything. So now they're a bit more like interactive with it. So 127 00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:45.720 huda: my social media manager, she's been like creating some posts and like stories and stuff. And then I told her a plan. So she's gonna post every day on her story like a countdown to the hackathon. Just so. It like builds more hype 128 00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.060 huda: and then 129 00:21:49.140 --> 00:22:00.949 huda: and then, like also my vice president, she's been helping with, like, you know, planning with the logistics like, she's gonna be helping me like, create the slides for the opening and closing ceremony. 130 00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:02.449 huda: She's gonna help. 131 00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:09.950 huda: Yeah, kind of with the more logistics like helping coming up with like the schedule and stuff like that. And then 132 00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.690 huda: the 133 00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:32.130 huda: secretary, she's gonna be helping with like kind of reaching out or not. Secretary. Sorry the director of Outreach. She's gonna like contact more nonprofits for like collaborations with a workshop. She's already been been doing pretty well with like collaboration Instagram posts. We've organized a couple. 134 00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.400 huda: I think. 135 00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:46.144 huda: 4 or 5. So far we have them lined up, but we haven't posted them yet. But yeah, we've like thought of ideas and kind of started like, I ideating about it. But 136 00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:53.340 huda: yeah, I think she's been in charge of like like solidifying like our workshop. Schedule. 137 00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.960 huda: And then I don't really have any responsibilities with for my treasure yet. 138 00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.370 huda: But I was thinking of 139 00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:06.539 huda: having her, maybe like contact more sponsors, or maybe 140 00:23:08.112 --> 00:23:12.240 huda: maybe just helping with support during the overall like Hackathon. 141 00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.650 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh. 142 00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.380 Jenny Duan: Hi, Saraj! What's up. 143 00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:25.780 Ivylevel: Oh, nothing, nothing like i i oh, sure, I wanted to be like in a stealth mode. Oh, my God, you guys, you guys, how are you doing on your. 144 00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.320 Jenny Duan: Have you heard who does exciting news about her? Hackathon. 145 00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:37.149 Ivylevel: Yes, and you know this is Huda right like she has not been excited about it. I don't know why, like right. 146 00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.089 Jenny Duan: It. It's amazing she got. She got so many cool sponsors. 147 00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:46.430 Ivylevel: That's a huge thing, right? Like, I don't have any sponsor. I have to spend my own money. So yeah. 148 00:23:47.450 --> 00:24:05.330 Jenny Duan: It is amazing, like all of this wolf from Alpha's like sponsoring. That's amazing. And all the cold emailing is is actually working cause. Now she has, like guest speakers. She's got other nonprofits to lead workshops. She has over 13,000 in prizes sponsored. 149 00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.080 Jenny Duan: which is really amazing. 150 00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:19.340 Ivylevel: Amazing. But also did she take some time to reflect this with you? One thing that I I find like missing. Again, not just from a call. It admissions, but also probably that's needed. Right? You were talking about experiences and reflection. 151 00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.050 Ivylevel: I think these are the moments where students have to reflect, I would imagine, right. 152 00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:35.320 Ivylevel: because it's really a part of where they've come from, you know, like not having any impact versus doing it might again. I don't want to distract, but might be something that you can always add, like you know, where I want that to. Also like write down like her reflection. 153 00:24:36.281 --> 00:24:38.669 Ivylevel: It's part of our story, right? So. 154 00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.350 Ivylevel: Greg. 155 00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:52.339 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Yeah. Huda, do you have any reflections on what this is like? And like the process of cold outreach, and finally getting responses. 156 00:24:52.690 --> 00:25:08.895 huda: I think it's definitely been like, kind of tiresome. I'd like, I definitely did like a lot of research like I looked at a bunch of other hackathons like in dev host itself, and seen like who sponsors them, and then trying to reach out to their sponsors. 157 00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:18.092 huda: that's kinda like how I discover, like the people to cool. Reach to. But obviously not all of them replied or like accepted. But 158 00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:26.090 huda: I think what's also ironic, is like the club that Hackathon Club, the one that was kind of like 159 00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.129 huda: exclusive 160 00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.699 huda: They had, like a hackathon 161 00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:43.089 huda: as well like La Co. Last 2 years. They've been hosting Hackathon, and now it's kind of like odd to be like the person like hosting the hackathon and actually there's like. 162 00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:53.620 huda: yeah, I don't know. I just feel like being in. I've always like participated in hackathons and like seeing like how much work goes into just like programming is pretty interesting. And 163 00:25:54.387 --> 00:26:10.922 huda: also, I feel like this, this event could be like one of the best events for empowering AI cause we wanna keep like everyone who signs up or like whoever everyone who participates, we're gonna like have their emails. And you know, like, store them for, like our newsletter, and then 164 00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:17.949 huda: also, like the discord like, they have to join the discord. And we're gonna convert that to like our empowering AI discord. 165 00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:31.910 huda: And then that way, we can like have a larger community. So I think I'm really excited for this Hackathon project. I just wanna like, try and get like as much engagement as possible, so like, make, like the most out of this event. 166 00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:48.989 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And it seems like it's really good that we're finally getting some metrics for your success, because in terms of like the amount of prizes sponsored the number of attendees, and like that's starting to pick up, which is really important, because I know what we were missing earlier was like that aspect of collecting metrics. 167 00:26:49.442 --> 00:26:50.710 Jenny Duan: Ross, do you have something to. 168 00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:58.999 Ivylevel: Yeah, I think my question now as a dad is like to, Jenny, right? Because I see this as a as a huge success. You know, transformation here, right? Like 169 00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:22.110 Ivylevel: I mean, I mean, literally, I'm like viewing as a founder. You know, it's it's a good metric to say that you've got sponsorship and what? What do you think Jenny like has been the main reason why, like with us, able to like make this change now, like, of course you know, with all your guidance like I mean, and you can be quite open about it as a parent, I would love to know, like, you know, why were things like not possible earlier and like, what is the change 170 00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:29.650 Ivylevel: that you see? In Huda? That's kind of driving some of these results. 171 00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:50.044 Jenny Duan: I think that the biggest change, in my opinion, is just who does proactiveness in reaching out. I think that that's just been really impressive and impactful to see that like she's taking the initiative. And I didn't even tell. I'm not telling her to, you know. Reach out to Wolf from. I didn't tell her to reach out to Xyz. I didn't tell her to reach out to all these speakers, but like 172 00:27:50.300 --> 00:28:14.090 Jenny Duan: now, she has this drive initiative that she can do it without direct instruction. Like, if I just say, Okay, you should reach out to like sponsors in general. Or Oh, you should, you know. Maybe get some other nonprofits to collaborate with you like she can take that direction, and she doesn't need to be told like exactly who to reach out to, or exactly what to reach out about. She can do it herself, and like be super proactive. And I think that's really awesome. 173 00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:23.779 Ivylevel: That's amazing. And just to know, like, you know, was this part of your game plan of your one of your strategies to? Because we knew that one of the week spots was really against scaling our impact. 174 00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:32.620 Ivylevel: So I would also like to understand, like, you know, where was that line in terms of your kind of guidance to her. And how did she pick up from? Where did she pick up and and do it? 175 00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:47.052 Jenny Duan: I think it's just been over time, I think, like in the beginning I used to tell her more everything. That she needed to reach out to in the context. But now 176 00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.509 Jenny Duan: But now I think she's been way more proactive. 177 00:28:51.110 --> 00:29:00.190 Ivylevel: But I think these were like the strategies that you were intentional about, like, you know. Now you kind of try like hustling like trying a few things. You know, things stick and things you don't. Yeah. So 178 00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.219 Ivylevel: that that was my kind of point. So okay. 179 00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:14.710 Ivylevel: good to know. This is great congrats to both of you all I mean. I you know. I think these are like some of the wins that are actually priceless. To be honest, right like as a parent like when I think about it. 180 00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.370 Ivylevel: Because what does it mean that, like, you know, she's now learned to 181 00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:39.020 Ivylevel: you know. At least she's getting some signal you know. That, you know, if she keeps consistently trying and being proactive like, you know. Anything is possible. Like, you know, I have no sponsor like. No one has actually ever wanted like to spend money like invest in my startup like so good luck, you know. Thank you. Thank you, Jenny. I think I love the the effort right? I mean, this is really 182 00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.820 Ivylevel: amazing. Sorry. I'm again going like 183 00:29:42.766 --> 00:29:43.999 Ivylevel: on mute. 184 00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:59.009 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and then, yeah, I was hoping to hear an update from some of your other orgs as well. And then I think we can spend the last 20 min kind of doing like an assessment of where you're at in terms of college applications in general, and like some bigger picture overview. 185 00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:05.660 huda: Yeah. Also, I had. I had a question. So since we're missing 2 extracurriculars, I was wondering, like. 186 00:30:06.163 --> 00:30:13.119 huda: that project I made last year. Mht jobs. Would that qualify as an extracurricular. 187 00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:24.749 Jenny Duan: I think it would, except the issue is, you're not super active in in maintaining that or working on that. Still. So because of that. I feel like it 188 00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:30.200 Jenny Duan: is better if you list that under like a broader web development or something like that, just because 189 00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.930 Jenny Duan: you aren't super. 190 00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.539 Jenny Duan: You are super active in maintaining that. 191 00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.810 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 192 00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:44.449 Ivylevel: So I'll tell you what has happened on that right? Of course, I think the website was something that Buddha did. And we started. 193 00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.740 Ivylevel: And then we actually create a Whatsapp group 194 00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.550 Ivylevel: and 195 00:30:48.540 --> 00:31:02.520 Ivylevel: you know, that has been the interface. And actually, there are some amazing metrics. The growth has been amazing. But I think the thing is that without left that hug said, oh, this is all like all like grown ups and uncles, you know. I don't want to be in this group. So she left that. So I I'm sorry with that. But 196 00:31:03.477 --> 00:31:07.290 Ivylevel: it now belongs to me, so you just can't use it. So 197 00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:08.770 Ivylevel: I'm disconnect. 198 00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.655 Ivylevel: Yeah, but I think it's been quite active. You know, Jenny, I think just for you to feel good. 199 00:31:14.503 --> 00:31:32.770 Ivylevel: it's very. It's a very active Whatsapp group in hyper local community. A lot of new people join. People keep asking me that they want to join. You know. So I mean, we can bring up like stats from that as well. It was just a channel that was actually more that gained more traction than a website, you know, people hardly go to website and all that stuff. 200 00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:45.186 Jenny Duan: Wow, yeah, I mean, I think that just tells you that like sometimes, not, everything needs to be like a website, especially as a developer, like, sometimes it's okay to just 201 00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.120 Jenny Duan: sometimes it's okay to just like. 202 00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.940 Jenny Duan: build something that other people use, regardless of whether it's like a website or a link or something else. 203 00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:09.599 huda: Good. So so regarding this like if I put it under like web development, and then like and then kind of explain it a little bit. Would I be able to use those like metrics like from the Whatsapp group to kind of prove it's like 204 00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:18.009 huda: significance, like under like web development. Kind of like with the amount of people in the group, or like something like that. 205 00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.990 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I think that that's a really good idea. 206 00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.050 huda: Okay, it's 207 00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.200 huda: and yeah. 208 00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.360 Ivylevel: Yeah, I think, in short, like, Jenny, just be like Iv level. All you need is a document. 209 00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:35.799 Ivylevel: and you need a tracker, and you need zoom with whatever 210 00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:42.590 Ivylevel: issues, with bandwidth. And you need absolutely a fantastic coach and student pair. That's it. 211 00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.830 Ivylevel: Right 212 00:32:44.735 --> 00:32:45.240 Ivylevel: great. 213 00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.389 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that's like, you just need whatever your audience wants. And then. 214 00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.685 Jenny Duan: furthermore, 215 00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:58.360 Jenny Duan: could you tell me about how your personal website and web development is going. 216 00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.030 huda: Yeah. So actually haven't gone too much time to like update stuff for folklip. 217 00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:17.969 huda: And also regarding like, I mean, like forklift on like my website? Because I haven't really gone like too many pictures or anything like about with folklift, which I think I should probably change. 218 00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:34.336 huda: But yeah. And then I think I I started up. A sub stack and also medium. I haven't posted on medium yet. But yeah, I'm trying to open have like an article on medium as well, and then 219 00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:51.669 huda: for folklift. We haven't gotten any new members. But I have drafted like a couple of like pieces. I want to post on folklift like, for example, or I think I don't know if I told you, but we also got like an international business for. 220 00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:52.039 Jenny Duan: Where are they? 221 00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.710 Jenny Duan: Tell me about this. 222 00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.360 huda: Oh, I think I'm with the 223 00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.849 huda: I'm sorry. I think I'm actually connected to my air pods. 224 00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.960 huda: Okay, it works now. 225 00:34:09.809 --> 00:34:17.560 huda: Yeah. So I got an international business. That was interviewed by like my vice President, who was in India. 226 00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:18.749 Jenny Duan: No. 227 00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.919 huda: Yeah. So had that article updated. 228 00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:26.239 Jenny Duan: You're going international and like all of your activities, that's super exciting. 229 00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:33.139 huda: Thank you. I'm trying to make it more international cause. I feel like that's like the best impact and like. 230 00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:55.719 huda: not really like not to be offensive. But like, I feel like people who are not from America work a bit like harder than like American like board members. So yeah, I think, like, it's been like a best experience, like working with people internationally. So I'm gonna try and find more people like that for folklift. But yeah, I think 231 00:34:55.719 --> 00:35:04.629 huda: the next step right now. I wanna like, obviously get like my own pieces out. But try and get more other like get other people. So I'm 232 00:35:04.789 --> 00:35:10.557 huda: depending on like how much engagement gets. I might have like a writing competition. 233 00:35:11.269 --> 00:35:14.509 huda: But again, like, I don't know like how much engagement it might get. 234 00:35:15.819 --> 00:35:19.197 huda: yeah. So I think that one's like, 235 00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:24.069 huda: don't have too much of an update about that one. But yeah, and like 236 00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:27.929 huda: let me see what other updates? 237 00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:42.139 huda: yeah, wait. So like the panel that I'm doing. So would that like, could I put that under like the description for the Nc. Whit award cause. It is through like Nc. Wit. 238 00:35:42.532 --> 00:35:44.169 huda: and I kind of, I think. 239 00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.210 Jenny Duan: Sense to me. 240 00:35:45.855 --> 00:35:59.670 huda: And also like, I think it's really relevant to me because it's like explaining for like technology in education, and like, I could talk about some Thoria. So yeah, I think I think it's pretty relevant. But yeah. 241 00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.758 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that makes sense to me as well. 242 00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.049 Jenny Duan: cool. So that's pretty much everything. Are there any other? Let me see 243 00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.779 Jenny Duan: any other. Do you have an update on the Youth Action Committee? Have you been going to those. 244 00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:25.378 huda: Oh, no, I thought you I thought you said it wasn't like kind of worth like kind of going to, because I won't be able to get a leadership position, but 245 00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah, just. But just in general, like, have you been able to network with the people there? 246 00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:36.090 Jenny Duan: And I guess that's what I meant to ask like, do you get to know the the adult leaders of it at all? Or is that no. 247 00:36:36.922 --> 00:36:46.409 huda: I haven't gone to but like kind of related to empowering AI my! My vice president reached out to 248 00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:52.820 huda: like the Mayor and one of the people from the Education Board, I think. 249 00:36:53.410 --> 00:37:05.639 huda: oh, sorry the compute. The Community Service Board and she like reached out to them to see if they'd be able to sponsor any of the prizes. So yeah, we've been like kind of doing that. 250 00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.255 huda: But I was also thinking of 251 00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:23.324 huda: like getting to know like our like. There's like a trustee for a school district. And she's like actually replied to my likes and see what announcement for the school. So I was like kind of thinking of connecting with her, so that we can 252 00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.549 huda: possibly do some sort of like 253 00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:34.090 huda: like interview, or something like that for maybe folklift, or just in general just getting to know her. But yeah. 254 00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.439 Jenny Duan: That sounds cool and and that sounds fruitful as well. 255 00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:52.450 Jenny Duan: okay. So just to recap, I think, like the biggest progress that you've made is the hackathon with empowering AI. Have you done any progress on synthoria and outreach on that front. 256 00:37:54.275 --> 00:37:59.094 huda: I haven't really gotten much progress on that end. 257 00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.200 huda: I mean. 258 00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:08.849 huda: I've I've just like kind of been posting about it on Tiktok, but like nothing too much like I haven't cold mailed about that 259 00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.130 huda: too much. But yeah. 260 00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.420 Jenny Duan: Is that something that you'd be interested in doing or working on more. 261 00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:31.320 huda: I think I would. But I think like, for now I think it wouldn't be really helpful, because, like a lot of the teachers are like out on vacation, and like won't be able to reply reply, so I don't know if that would even be helpful. 262 00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.096 Jenny Duan: Got it. 263 00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:52.279 Jenny Duan: let's think about other ways to. I think that it's still possible for you to expand and and grow and share synth aria when even when schools not in session like, there's other ways that you can gain exposure to the game. Did the code of classy people ever respond to your like publicity, request email to them. 264 00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.779 huda: They haven't. 265 00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:59.019 Jenny Duan: Okay. How? How long ago did you send that? And do you wanna maybe send a follow up to them? 266 00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.310 huda: Yeah, I sent it on our call. So like. 267 00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.410 huda: I think it was Tuesday or Monday. 268 00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.440 huda: Okay. 269 00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.340 Jenny Duan: Was the follow up? Or that was the original email. 270 00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.749 huda: His original email. 271 00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.200 Jenny Duan: Okay. 272 00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.632 Jenny Duan: I think it's probably fine. If you send a follow up right now. 273 00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.519 Jenny Duan: why don't you do that? Yeah. 274 00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.170 huda: Does this look good? 275 00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.040 Jenny Duan: Let me see. 276 00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:04.975 huda: Oh, 277 00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that looks good. 278 00:40:08.744 --> 00:40:11.099 huda: She's in an hour should schedule send it. 279 00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.289 Jenny Duan: You can schedule, send it for tomorrow morning. 280 00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.390 huda: Look at it. 281 00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:25.209 huda: Yeah. No response from like the team. Vo person as well. But I think that's expected. 282 00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:31.070 Jenny Duan: I think that's fine. Did you find a list of other news articles or news places to pitch to. 283 00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.439 huda: Oh, that that kind of slipped my mind. 284 00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:38.355 Jenny Duan: Okay, why don't we do that right now? Actually, let's spend like 5 min and just compile like a list. 285 00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:44.009 Jenny Duan: Besides, team vogue. Let me think of other places. 286 00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:58.339 huda: Oh, yeah, I think I did. I looked for a couple, and there was like, New York times. But I think I don't think they're. I think it's just for the school year, so I don't think they're accepting any right now. 287 00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.710 Jenny Duan: I just found like a big list. 288 00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.810 Jenny Duan: Care. 289 00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.009 Jenny Duan: You see, this. 290 00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.940 huda: Oh, that's the same list I saw. 291 00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.329 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, perfect. 292 00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.820 Jenny Duan: They have a ton. They have a ton 293 00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:17.980 Jenny Duan: to them. 294 00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.470 huda: Yeah, some of these are like inactive. But I can like 295 00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.850 huda: which you're like. 296 00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.057 huda: Also, I had a question about empowering AI. So 297 00:41:49.710 --> 00:42:15.120 huda: we wanted to do a thing where we just like make a bunch of like curriculum curriculums and just kind of like, have them on our website and have, like a lot of them about like different stem topics like maybe like different women in stem. And then, like, for example, something really similar to like the Synthoria lesson toolkit. And if we make like a lot of them. 298 00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:21.475 huda: do you think that's like valuable for empowering AI like, do you think that's something that we should actually like commit to or 299 00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.570 huda: Well, like we can stray away from the idea. 300 00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.990 Jenny Duan: So tell me more where these like toolkits would be distributed, and how that would work. 301 00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:53.660 huda: Yeah, so we're gonna make like, make them on like, maybe like Google Docs, or like, maybe like, make a Pdf for each of them. And then just like, have like a page on our empowering AI website with like a large directory of like lesson toolkits that people can use. And then, like, maybe do something similar to like Senoria, where we like reached out to teachers. 302 00:42:54.014 --> 00:43:04.720 huda: and then we can use like the same email, same emails that I contacted. But yeah, like, I think that would. I think that's what I was itating. But yeah. 303 00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:11.010 Jenny Duan: I think that that could work. What would be the effort on that like? How much time would that take. 304 00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:23.142 huda: I I don't think it should take too much time, because for one, I wanna like definitely get some help from some of the board members which don't have much to do like my treasure, and then also 305 00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:32.010 huda: like I think it would be it would be fine if we kind of use like AI for some of them like not completely. Because then that would like 306 00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:42.450 huda: that would just not be valuable. But like we, we can definitely like speed up the process with AI and like, come up with ideas, maybe like help format stuff. 307 00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:48.849 huda: But yeah, I don't think it should be too much effort. But yeah, we were thinking of creating like a lot of them, like, maybe, like 308 00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.420 huda: like a hundred, maybe like just if possible. 309 00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:02.960 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that works. Then. I think that as long as it's not too much of a lift for you. And then I think that it it should be like 310 00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.129 Jenny Duan: it should be effective. And then what is your plan for distributing these again? 311 00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:20.939 huda: So similar thing with synthory. We were. We wanted to like cold email, a bunch of teachers, and I was saying, maybe we can use like the same emails for the centuria distribution, because they're kind of similar topics. 312 00:44:21.475 --> 00:44:28.060 huda: But yeah, like, I don't know, like again, like that wasn't really effective for centuria. But like 313 00:44:28.572 --> 00:44:34.920 huda: I feel like I don't know just again, like with the similar like distribution metric that would also be pretty helpful. 314 00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.496 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. 315 00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:43.280 Jenny Duan: I think that that seems like a good project and a good use of your summer. So 316 00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:59.340 Jenny Duan: as long as it's not too like high lift for you, I would say definitely, go for that and then finally, I was wondering 1, st 1st and Thoria back on that again, have? How is the social media been? And have you been able to gain more traction slash players through that. 317 00:45:00.482 --> 00:45:03.857 huda: Let me actually check the statistics for 318 00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:11.164 huda: for the game. But I did get like one of my videos. It was like 13,000 views by now. 319 00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.579 Jenny Duan: I think you mentioned that. That's awesome. 320 00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:18.239 huda: Yeah, it's still growing. But yeah, like, I think. 321 00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.183 huda: hold on, 322 00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:36.904 huda: I'm gonna look on like the analytics for Simplia. But okay, so right now we're at 390 plays. So not too like big, but 323 00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.940 huda: I think social media's definitely helped it. I think. 324 00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. 325 00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:56.539 Jenny Duan: I think that that's not too bad. That's that. Seems like it's grown a lot. How have their other videos been performing? And have you been consistent cause? I think that's awesome, like I feel like you've been making great progress. There. 326 00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:02.649 huda: Yeah, I've been like, I've been trying. So sometimes it's kind of hard for me to post 3 times a day. So I've been like. 327 00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:03.560 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I am. 328 00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.121 huda: Like once a day at least. 329 00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.460 huda: and then a lot of my videos, just like 330 00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:19.509 huda: text about like women and stem like random facts about women stem. I think those have been doing the best. Which kind of works out great cause like that's the kind of content that I want to create and stuff. 331 00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:30.599 huda: And so, like, I think, I've been making a lot of videos about like women in stem. And that's that's I'm glad that's the one that's doing well, not like the random videos. 332 00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:50.845 huda: But yeah, I think I think, I'm definitely trying to be a little more consistent with social media. And then also, like with my Instagram. I kind of did the similar trick to like the my nonprofit Instagram is where we kind of follow a couple of like nonprofits, and then, like you get like 400 followers in like 3 seconds. 333 00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 334 00:46:53.334 --> 00:46:58.420 huda: It's been working out, cause like I was stuck at like 70 for like the longest time. And now, like. 335 00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:03.150 huda: I'm kind, I'm like, I like 1, 50 and almost like nearing 200. So. 336 00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:04.600 huda: yeah. 337 00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.470 Jenny Duan: Hey? That's pretty good. That's pretty good. 338 00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:13.660 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Do we cover everything in terms of all your projects and extracurriculars? Or did I miss anything? 339 00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:14.450 Jenny Duan: I. 340 00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:16.600 huda: I think, currently, yeah, yeah, I think that's 341 00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.500 huda: actually for some Thoria, like, I was wondering. 342 00:47:21.007 --> 00:47:32.620 huda: like you said there was kind of like a bit of like like a slowdown on like the distribution. So like, is there anything I could be doing right now to like? Expand my impact with synthoria. 343 00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:48.159 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think what's in Thoria. So their primary target here is to get as many people to play as possible. That's the goal. And then other than that, like the extra, the extraneous projects. Or if you can get schools to adopt it in their learning toolkits, that's really awesome. I think 344 00:47:48.480 --> 00:48:10.739 Jenny Duan: trying to just be your own pr agent is gonna be the most difficult thing. So like that means reaching out to different publications. Actually, that's 1 thing that you can do reach out to different publications and see if they'll feature you your game like, for example. I know that there's a lot of like Indie gaming newsletters. I was wondering maybe you could find a list of those and start pitching Thoria to have them share in like a monthly or weekly newsletter. 345 00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:12.070 huda: Okay, yeah, 346 00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:13.580 huda: and 347 00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.050 huda: I think. 348 00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:43.550 huda: do you think so? A lot of people that I know like, just play on like their phones and stuff, and especially when I try to like, advertise synthory on my phone. It's like they can't play the game because it's for computers. So then I was thinking like going back, and like, I've I've tried coding it for phones, but it's also kind of hard, and it might take a lot of time or not a lot of time. But like I might have to like focus on that more than like a few other extracurriculars. 349 00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:53.499 huda: So do you think it's like worth like doing that? Because I feel like I would be able to get like a lot more players if it was available for Mobile. But yeah. 350 00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.640 Jenny Duan: What would it look like to have an app. 351 00:48:56.762 --> 00:49:13.060 huda: So I don't know if I don't know if it'd possibly be like an app. But I could definitely like do thing where? I guess you can choose, like if you're on computer, or if you're on phone, and then if you're on phone, it gives you like, like the buttons to click, and then it, you can move with that. 352 00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:19.539 huda: But yeah, like, I think that might take some time implementing like every scene. But yeah. 353 00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:28.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think if you can do mobile native, I think that's like, gonna be much better cause it opens it to be accessible to much more people. 354 00:49:29.046 --> 00:49:33.349 Jenny Duan: How much time would that take? Is that and slash? How difficult would that be. 355 00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.170 huda: Maybe if I dedicate like 356 00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:42.910 huda: 2 or 3 days to just like focusing fully on synthoria, I'd be able to make a bunch of improvements 357 00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:49.050 huda: and like, actually like, if I were to be able to turn it into an app 358 00:49:49.478 --> 00:49:57.041 huda: that could also be pretty good, because I could definitely like, have it on the app store. That would be like pretty significant 359 00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:09.320 huda: and like that, might take a little longer. But if I were to just like change the controls like on like the web. I think I should take like, maybe like 2 like dedicated days for that. But yeah. 360 00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:24.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, then, that seems like a good idea. In that case I would. I would spend some time trying to make it like different playable on web. And I think 2 days is like not a lot of time when it comes to sacrif like sacrificing time for your summer 361 00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:37.269 Jenny Duan: cool. And then, before we just move into the broader assessment, are you ready to go to London like, how do you feel about your travel coming up and like wrapping up, making sure everything's set in the States before you leave the country. 362 00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:59.049 huda: I think I'm a bit nervous because of, you know, empower hacks. It's gonna be like kind of hectic from now on. Cause I'm trying to, I said. I made like a document with like kind of like instructions for each of the officers, cause I won't be able to work too much there, and so I won't be able to like fully, like focus on the slides, or, like, you know, create all those. 363 00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:17.609 huda: And so like, I kind of have, like a bunch of like instructions. But then, since, like the timings will be different and everything, it might be hard to to like contact and stuff like that. So I'm like kind of making sure that everything set but I really, really, I'm trusting my board members to like kind of follow through with, like the things that they're doing 364 00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:33.140 huda: and like, I just like kind of nervous like if they don't participate or like, if they don't do their goals, but I think I think I believe in them, and especially they have a lot of pressure, this new deadline as well. So I think it's going to work. 365 00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:42.169 huda: But yeah, I think I'm excited definitely for the trip. But yeah, I'm a bit nervous with, like my extra curriculums running in the background. 366 00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.600 Jenny Duan: Do you have exciting things planned? What does your day to day look like. 367 00:51:47.060 --> 00:52:02.189 huda: Oh, we're probably just like we're going to like different places like the like the museum, and then sightseeing and everything. And then I don't know if I'd be able to like work when I come back. But like when I come back from like 368 00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:13.000 huda: touring, but like yeah, I think a few of the days we're probably just gonna like, look at, like some cool buildings like even like like Oxford, like the college. I think that would be pretty 369 00:52:13.806 --> 00:52:17.489 huda: and just like in general, that would be pretty cool. But yeah. 370 00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.260 huda: yeah. 371 00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:31.899 Jenny Duan: Happy to leave her home alone. Go to go to London, have so much fun. You're gonna have a great experience, and I think you'll learn a lot. How long are you gonna be there again? 372 00:52:32.866 --> 00:52:35.430 huda: For around like 9 to 10 days. 373 00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.775 Jenny Duan: Cool 374 00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.589 Jenny Duan: and is there anything like specific that you're especially excited for. 375 00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:53.749 huda: I'm definitely excited, for like the the red buses cause that's like we're gonna see like everything. And then also, like 376 00:52:54.146 --> 00:52:57.580 huda: it's just like cool. And then also, like the the phone boots. 377 00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:04.270 huda: And then I think the weather is gonna be really nice there. Cause right now, it's okay, like a really hot in California. And so. 378 00:53:04.522 --> 00:53:06.540 Jenny Duan: I think. Was it not hot in London? 379 00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.542 huda: I checked the I checked the 380 00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:14.080 huda: the forecast, and it's like literally like a high of 64 degrees. And that's like. 381 00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.949 Jenny Duan: That's cold. Oh, my gosh! 382 00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.809 Jenny Duan: But you like! Do you like cold weather? 383 00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:24.649 huda: Yeah, I love cold weather, cause like all my clothing is like sweaters and stuff, and I hate wearing T-shirts. 384 00:53:25.374 --> 00:53:27.149 Jenny Duan: School in Southern California. 385 00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.799 huda: I mean, actually. 386 00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.810 Jenny Duan: Good. 387 00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:35.560 huda: Older than it was a lot colder than the Bay Area. Strangely enough. 388 00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.980 Jenny Duan: That's a i don't know. That's like, gonna be a consistent pattern at Usc. But. 389 00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:46.090 huda: It was like a hundred 13 degrees here, and then it was like it was like 390 00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:49.099 huda: 80 in LA. And I was like. 391 00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:53.570 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, okay. I don't think it's 100 and thi 113, really, a mountain house. 392 00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:54.590 huda: Yeah. 393 00:53:55.750 --> 00:54:00.999 Jenny Duan: Oh, wow! Okay, I think La is colder than that. I that's so unexpected. Wow! 394 00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.460 huda: I was like really like. 395 00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:08.440 huda: and like kind of like the San Joaquin Valley. That's terrible weather. 396 00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:15.711 Jenny Duan: Wow, okay, understood. Okay, I I now I understand the the pain of of this. 397 00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:18.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, gotcha, 398 00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:44.910 Jenny Duan: alright. And I'm just curious now. I think we can spend. Not curious, but I think we can spend like 10 min talking about your plan. Slash your your, how you're doing for the rest of the summer, and like just rolling into college application season. So I think right now, as far as I can see, the biggest concerns are just filling out the rest of your extracurriculars. So adding the other 2 that you're missing right now and then. Oh. 399 00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:51.949 Jenny Duan: yeah, of course. Let me just spend 5 min talking about this, and then we can go through your concerns. Sarah. So I think 400 00:54:52.700 --> 00:55:11.429 Jenny Duan: the biggest thing is just filling out your extracurriculars list. I think this is like most pressing for you. And I think that the the we talked about a lot of different options in regards to your extracurriculars list? Have you decided on which 2 you wanted to go with out of everything that we discussed? And also, did you see the thing that I recently sent you via Instagram, DM. 401 00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.790 huda: Yeah. Yeah. 402 00:55:13.178 --> 00:55:35.851 huda: Yeah, I think, okay. So obviously applied to that. But for the last 2 extra curriculars, I think definitely like, the web development that has, like a lot of things that we could talk about like I've developed like the website for full cliff. I don't know if that directly goes under like web development. But I may see jobs. I think that's like, definitely a good thing to mention. And 403 00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.420 huda: I haven't been able to like freelance web develop yet. 404 00:55:40.848 --> 00:55:46.279 huda: Like, I'm having trouble like setting up prices like like that might be like 405 00:55:46.660 --> 00:56:02.043 huda: most attractive to people, and also like to my scale as well. So like, I think I'm gonna like, spend some time kind of out for free. I think I'll spend some time kind of like setting that up. But yeah, and 406 00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.389 huda: so I think web development. That might be a good one 407 00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.870 huda: and 408 00:56:07.688 --> 00:56:10.080 huda: for the last one 409 00:56:11.012 --> 00:56:24.059 huda: so I did apply to that like cafe job. But if I do get that program that you send me on Instagram, I think that'll be like, definitely like better than that. And 410 00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:29.350 huda: yeah, I I kind of forget, like what what other options we discussed. But yeah. 411 00:56:30.755 --> 00:56:36.454 Jenny Duan: I think the other option is just freelance web development, like which you already mentioned, and then 412 00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:41.200 Jenny Duan: getting more involved with these Action Committee, but like we kind of rolled that one out. 413 00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:43.610 Jenny Duan: So I think that it seems. 414 00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:48.099 Jenny Duan: I think, seems good. What we've discussed, and like having those 415 00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:54.859 Jenny Duan: having the web development be one, and then like participating in hackathons, that's another. Oh, that's another option. I don't know if we mentioned that. 416 00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.430 huda: I forgot to mention with hack club 417 00:56:59.465 --> 00:57:19.030 huda: they have like this thing called like hack arcade, and then they give. And then, like you, basically just like develop websites or like develop like anything through code which matches like the theme that they sent. And then, like, you can like like log in your hours, and if you log enough hours, you can like win prizes, and so like 418 00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:22.659 huda: like, would that be like kind of 419 00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:30.689 huda: productive for for that extracurricular or do I should I just like participate in hackathons if you think that's stronger. 420 00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:44.399 Jenny Duan: I think you should just participate in hackathons and try to win like. I think, as long as you're able to win prizes because you, I think, also have space for 2 more prizes, and your or 2 more awards on your awards list, and so, like Hackathon prize could be a good place to do that. 421 00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:45.015 huda: Okay. 422 00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.129 Jenny Duan: Cool, and then, Sarah, she wanted the last 5 min. 423 00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:52.190 Ivylevel: Yeah. 424 00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.910 Ivylevel: Have you met Samia Jenny before. 425 00:57:55.811 --> 00:58:00.480 Jenny Duan: I don't think I have. I think I've been meaning to, but I don't think. 426 00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.190 Ivylevel: Yeah. 427 00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.740 Jenny Duan: Her. 428 00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.869 Ivylevel: I just wanted to introduce like this is Samia and you know. 429 00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:08.980 Jenny Duan: Oh, Hi, super! Nice to meet you! I'm Jenny. 430 00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.733 Ivylevel: Nice to meet you, too. Heard lots of great things about you. 431 00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:16.879 Jenny Duan: Oh, thanks! Are you? Are you excited for London, too? Are you going on the trip. 432 00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.310 Ivylevel: Yeah, I'm excited. I've been like looking forward to it for a while. 433 00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.399 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun. I really wanna go to London. I haven't been in like 434 00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:25.710 Jenny Duan: the years. 435 00:58:26.024 --> 00:58:28.400 Jenny Duan: So I don't really remember most of it, but 436 00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.790 Jenny Duan: I've heard it's really funny. 437 00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.010 Jenny Duan: Pardon. 438 00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.850 Ivylevel: I hope you get to go soon. 439 00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:42.550 Jenny Duan: Thanks. Yeah, I really hope so, too, except I'm in New York this summer, which is really really fun. And I I do, Miss California, but, like New York is, is very, very fun. 440 00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.360 Ivylevel: You know, just like so full of energy. 441 00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:53.669 Ivylevel: So yeah, I mean, you can ask. You know, like, you know, Samia, actually wanted to do one session with you as well, Jenny, like it's it's just that. 442 00:58:54.182 --> 00:58:59.027 Ivylevel: This like I mean, you're in so much demand. And you know. 443 00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:08.539 Ivylevel: you know such well revered and so popular here like, you know. I think in terms of just like getting some rigor on like her searching for internship. 444 00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:23.359 Ivylevel: and, you know, preparing her resume and profile and all that. So I think I think that you know, even though she's designed but to be very honest, I think it's it's all the same at the end of the day, right? So that that kind of skill and rigor so might be one session whenever you're free, like, you know. 445 00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:27.729 Ivylevel: would love to avail. Yeah, I think Buddha is more than happy to kind of, 446 00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:32.610 Ivylevel: you know. Give away like you know, gift one of her sessions to Samia. 447 00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.680 Ivylevel: Well. 448 00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:52.410 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I would love to help, I think, like definitely recruiting and internship cycles are super tough and like, I definitely empathize with like your search, which I know you'll be having to go through in the fall. That was me last year, and I remember how painful it was. So you know you've got this. 449 00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.720 Ivylevel: Thank you. Yeah, I've been. I I've been like, kind of 450 00:59:55.810 --> 01:00:07.349 Ivylevel: like out of the student board. And I'm thinking, well, I need to actually start, you know, looking into internships. So kind of the transition is a little difficult. But that's what I'm trying to get into now. 451 01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:12.576 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And are you looking for design like uiux? Or are you looking for like product? Design? 452 01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:15.379 Jenny Duan: What were you looking for? 453 01:00:15.673 --> 01:00:29.450 Ivylevel: I really want to get more into product design, because this past year I've been part of clubs that are very into the literal Us design using figma, which is great. But I kind of wanted to go into more of the product design 454 01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:49.420 Ivylevel: area as well, but really anything just to get in the industry like, really get my hands dirty and like, try, I mean, you can actually join a startup, you know, like, I mean, this is the saddest part, like startups are inviting you all. And you guys all want to go and have a coffee like a free coffee in adobe and other places. That's what it is. That's fine. 455 01:00:50.970 --> 01:01:01.450 Jenny Duan: I think startups and big industry are all good, like I've I've done a couple of startup internships, and they've been super fun right now I'm in like a big company, and like that's also nice, too. 456 01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.046 Ivylevel: Great thanks. 457 01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:13.013 Ivylevel: yeah. So I I did have a few questions on you know who does profile so? I think 458 01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:24.542 Ivylevel: might be, you know, we can probably do it in the next time. Really like. Wanted to kind of understand the why behind, you know, like some of the weak spots like, if we were to do like a game plan. Now, to be honest. 459 01:01:25.158 --> 01:01:37.299 Ivylevel: I have feeling like, you know, I'd send you a text message as well. Right, Jenny, so maybe we can do it next time. But what are like your top weak spots that you see today, like, you know, I know that extracurriculars is an area. But 460 01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:55.539 Ivylevel: I you know, just to, I feel like, you know, Huda also needs to know, like, you know why, certain things are important. Of course, there's like a scale and impact that we keep talking talking about, but also in terms of why is a hackathon important? Or why is like, you know, a civic engagement important, you know, if you can actually throw some more light there. 461 01:01:55.883 --> 01:02:08.220 Ivylevel: Because how does it really impact her narrative and her profile strength? Right? And then also on the award side. So, you know, can you give a bit of like, you know, light you know, kind of insights on that. 462 01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:11.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that who does biggest 463 01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:39.660 Jenny Duan: pain point right now is just having more credibility when it comes to extracurriculars. And that comes with working with more established, either working with more established organizations, or having more people involved in her projects, because right now, who does profile is pretty much heavy towards the self initiated sense, and that, like most of her, things, are just things that she's initiated herself. But a lot of other people's profiles, and you don't have to be like everyone else. But a lot of other people's profiles are are involved with like larger organizations that 464 01:02:39.660 --> 01:03:04.570 Jenny Duan: have a lot of the backing. And this means that who does like putting in a ton of extra effort to like initiate most things herself, which is very impressive. But I do think that she's missing like that sort of credibility there, that companies, larger organization. So I think that's why I'm like sending her lots of things to apply to, to see like, if she can affiliate herself with the larger org, or just build out her her credibility more by like getting more metrics for hers. 465 01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:12.440 Ivylevel: Okay? So I think that's more the recognition about it. Right? Some validity right around her. Initiatives, primarily. So you kind of need like 466 01:03:12.765 --> 01:03:22.460 Ivylevel: big logos and symbols. Right? Like sponsoring now is, actually gives a a kind of a credibility. Right? That, okay, this is like a credible kind of hackathon initiative, that kind of stuff, correct. 467 01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:24.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 468 01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:47.619 Ivylevel: But then, what about like, you know? Because I think one of the things was thanks, Samia. One of the things was also around you know, like your leadership. I know that. You know there are a couple of items in terms of when you're looking at extracurriculars right. Some of the areas where I think she's got her passion. You know. There are some unique things, I think in terms of passion in terms of I don't know, like, you know, stem and leadership like there were a couple of things right? 469 01:03:47.620 --> 01:04:00.810 Ivylevel: So and I know that you have been pushing her quite hard to get involved on advocacy. And you know, civic engagement and reaching out to politicians and all that stuff. So I really wanted to understand the why behind it. 470 01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:11.103 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I think that the reason why I've been pushing her, and also I have to be mindful. I have a meeting with Anushka right now, so I have to hop off pretty soon. But. 471 01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:15.000 Ivylevel: Later. Yeah, I think we can talk about this later. No worries. 472 01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:36.930 Jenny Duan: Okay. But I do think like civic engagement just shows her leadership. And like again, Atlanta, with, like the bigger picture like, why does advocacy matter? Why does it matter in the long term? Oh, so she can affect policy and like, make higher level impact. That's why it just shows like in the future, what kind of direction she might take in terms of her career, and like how she might use what she's studying in school to like impact the world in a bigger picture way. 473 01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:59.950 Ivylevel: Okay, amazing. So, Jen, Jenny, I know that. You know we don't have like, you know. after I I don't like. I I probably need like an hour, because you know it would be good. I've sent a message, let me know, like, you know, because there are some game plan reports, and you're free to join the game plan sessions like the second sessions on weekend. But if not, at the least like you know. I I would just love to run all the game plan ready right now. 474 01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.500 Jenny Duan: Oh, cool! Sounds good! 475 01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.420 Ivylevel: Let me know bye, take care! Thanks.",

How's it going. 2 00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.490 huda: Hi! It's going well, how are you? 3 00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.150 Jenny Duan: How was I'm good? How was the final day of Kurtu's policy? 4 00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.289 huda: There's actually one more day but we. 5 00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.840 Jenny Duan: All right with tomorrow. 6 00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.749 huda: Thing. So yeah, it's going pretty well. 7 00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:13.140 Jenny Duan: Are? Is your team done with your project? 8 00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.049 huda: Yeah, we're done. We just need to do a little bit of practice and everything. But yeah. 9 00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.137 Jenny Duan: Can you tell me like how it went like 10 00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.200 Jenny Duan: How did everything go overall like? What were the tools you use? And like was the end result. What you wanted. 11 00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:57.809 huda: Yeah, so I definitely, we definitely had like a lot of problems. So we wanted to make like a resource or like, give, like, data about how much, how like the correlation between like people's access to computers, and then like like the amount of income that they have and like, especially in like 3rd World countries. And then that way, we wanted to like urge people to like donate to computer accessibility and 12 00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:26.739 huda: those places. So that's what our product was. And then so we made like a website, where that you could like donate. And then, like view statistics. We just use Google sites. So Ca, so it's like easy. And we could all work on it at once. And and we spent like a bulk of the time doing like research about like which data sets to use. And then, like like, kind of finding data sets that show the correlation best. And then we also. 13 00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:45.089 huda: we used this thing called Googl",
    "e colab to like kind of code. Coded like a visualization of the data. But like it didn't really like look appealing and like you couldn't read it at all. So we just ended up using like Google, I think it was Google notebook. 14 00:06:45.533 --> 00:07:03.746 huda: So like, make the statistics but still turn out really good. Good. And then, yeah, like, right now, we're just working on like, like our demo, like our pitch, like slide, I guess. And then, yeah, I think it's going well, we definitely have to settle a few times. 15 00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:11.919 huda: because, like, we didn't have like the technical ability to. But yeah, I think it's I think it's good. For, like the time we had. 16 00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.230 Jenny Duan: Can I see it? Do you have like a demo. 17 00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.020 huda: Yeah. 18 00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:19.640 huda: let me. 19 00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.990 huda: It's cool computers for everyone. 20 00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.600 Jenny Duan: Wow! It looks really cool. 21 00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:48.540 huda: Cute and then we have, like a donate now thing where it has like different organizations. And then this is the tab that I mainly worked on data visualization. 22 00:07:49.064 --> 00:07:50.840 huda: and it was like. 23 00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.320 Jenny Duan: Looks really good. 24 00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.080 huda: Thank you. There's like a map. There's like online graph. 25 00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.860 huda: And so you could kind of see the correlation. But yeah. 26 00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.810 Jenny Duan: Looks really good. How does this make you feel about like data science? And in that subject. 27 00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:25.209 huda: I think it was really cool. It was definitely like a lot easier than I expected. Like especially with SQL, because I never. I didn't know. SQL, and I kind of thought it was a super hard like language, which I'm sure it is, but like from what I know, like. It's not as like 28 00:08:25.754 --> 00:",
    "08:28.299 huda: scary is like what I thought. 29 00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:38.209 Jenny Duan: Amazing. Well, I'm glad that went really. Well. Other than that like, do you have any other updates on things that you've been working on. 30 00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:54.109 huda: Yeah, I have like a couple of updates, actually, so, so through nc, we're actually someone contacted me like, someone on the slack posted like they're looking for some of the Nc. What? Like high school members to join a panel 31 00:08:54.109 --> 00:09:10.459 huda: of speakers for like an educator event, and so we can kinda give kind of like, yeah, like our opinion about like technology and classrooms and stuff like that. And so I reply, and I was like, I'm really interested. And so I'm meeting with them tomorrow morning to like kind of go over like 32 00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:29.359 huda: it's like our initial meeting. To see, like to plan out the logistics and everything. And then I told them that I have to like record, that I'm available through like a recording, because at that time I'm gonna be in Jcm for yeah, I'm gonna be in Jcm, so I won't be able to attend it virtually. But yeah. And then I think. 33 00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.089 Jenny Duan: Time you might be able to. 34 00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.069 Jenny Duan: What time would it be. 35 00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.295 huda: I think it's like in the morning slash like afternoon. 36 00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.000 Jenny Duan: Like you can still find time like, and Jake can't do it. 37 00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:51.089 huda: I guess, like I'm not sure how Jim packed this cause it cause during like the orientation for J. Camp, they said we'd be busy like the entire day, and just have like like 38 00:09:51.220 --> 00:10:14.639 huda: at night to kind of chill. But yeah, I know, like they they were deciding. Like to begin with, they're like, Oh, we don't know if we want to do like a live panel, or if we want to do recorded. And I said, oh, I think recorded wou",
    "ld be a great option that way. We can have like more information and stuff. But I'm happy to like cooperate. And then, yeah. So we're we're kind of deciding that. And then, like, I'm meeting with them tomorrow morning. 39 00:10:14.994 --> 00:10:17.059 huda: To like discuss stuff like that. 40 00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.079 Jenny Duan: How do they say that they found you again. 41 00:10:19.748 --> 00:10:21.480 huda: Do that and see what slack. 42 00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.650 Jenny Duan: Cool 43 00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.119 Jenny Duan: and like, how do they like isolate you versus other people? Did they say that. 44 00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:45.620 huda: I think everyone who kinda like it was like like someone like the organizer. She posted it on like the slack. And then I like, replied was like, Oh, I'd definitely be interested.

There's actually some exciting news. I got 2 sponsors for for heather hackathon. It's a wolfram and dot xyz, and so they're like they have, like a lot of prizes for 49 00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.100 Jenny Duan: Pause, pause. How did you get these sponsors? Those are some pretty big names. 50 00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:43.842 huda: I email them. And like I was like, Hey, I'm from this hackathon like, I'm like organizing this hackathon. It's gonna be virtual and like we'd really love for your with your support for sponsorship. And even if you're not able to like sponsor Hackathon like we just love free to be involved. And then like, both of them replied, and they were like, Oh, we'd love. 51 00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.239 Jenny Duan: Amazi",
    "ng. That's amazing. Yeah. 52 00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:54.284 huda: Thank you. Yeah. And then we haven't really started advertising. But we already have, like 5 people who signed up 53 00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:11.360 huda: and so I think this is going pretty well. We've we've like kind of started advertising, but like I think, I I made like a kind of like a advertising plan for my social media marketers like with a bunch of like Instagram post ideas and like say, Talk post ideas. 54 00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:31.796 huda: and like kind of and so like, especially now that I'm gonna be going to London, and I might be busy like she'll definitely be able to cover that cause. I gave her a lot of resources. But yeah. And then, we're also trying to. And also, yeah, I got a judge for empower hacks as well. 55 00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.550 huda: she's a product at. 56 00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.868 huda: I'm like a product manager at 57 00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.649 huda: I forgot which company I think it was like Amazon, or something like that 58 00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:53.149 huda: or no. It was something. It was like Microsoft, or something like it was like a big tech company. And so yeah, so she's gonna be a judge. And then I also reached out to. 59 00:12:53.150 --> 00:13:00.070 Jenny Duan: Molly, how did you get like this is huge congrats on all the progress? Tell me more about how like all of this is coming to be. 60 00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.563 huda: So actually, 61 00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:22.489 huda: So the judge I actually like. A while ago I reached out to her cause. I wanted to do like a speaker event through Instagram, like I reached out to her on Instagram, and then we never got to do that event, because I guess, like she never sent over the information about like the slides and everything. So then I just reached out to her recently. And I was like. 62 00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:42.830 huda: Hey, we're running this hackathon. It's about like increasing like the platform for w",
    "omen in stem. Fe in the stem field. We'd love for you to be a judge. And if possible, even like do a panel and then she said, Oh, I'd be happy to judge so like that's how we got her involvement. 63 00:13:43.316 --> 00:13:44.210 huda: So yeah. 64 00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.313 huda: And then 65 00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.798 huda: also, like, on on the empowering Instagram. 66 00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.029 huda: we hit like 280 followers, and we're still. 67 00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.180 Jenny Duan: Sure app. 68 00:13:56.532 --> 00:13:58.640 huda: Yeah. And so. 69 00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.880 huda: okay? And then, we reached out to another nonprofit that we follow. 70 00:14:04.205 --> 00:14:15.264 huda: I think they do like sustainability, like tech and stuff like that and then we reached out, and then I asked if they'd be interested in like running a workshop in our hackathon. 71 00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.390 huda: And then I kind of like made a document with like a few plans that I had and then like 72 00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:31.260 huda: and then they like looked at the document, said, Oh, we'd love to do the 1st one. So now they're gonna like, make the slides and do like a workshop in our hackathon. And then I'm gonna try and get 73 00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.409 huda: a few more nonprofits to do the same thing that way. We'll have like a bunch of 74 00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.670 huda: workshops. 75 00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:56.370 huda: And additionally, I'm trying to get a few more judges or like panelists. So in the women and games discord, I've been trying to like. Ask other ambassadors if they'd be interested in like judging or being a panelist. But yeah, like, not too much engagement there. But yeah. 76 00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:07.169 Jenny Duan: Wait. That's huge. 50, $13,000 in sponsors is amazing. Can you tell me a bit more about about that? Like, what are they exactly sponsoring. 77 00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:20.869 huda: Yeah, so Wolfram is like providing everyone",
    " who everyone who participates with a I think it was 30 day subscription to Wolfram, which is like, I think, $25 worth. 78 00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.979 huda: And then and then I think 79 00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.430 huda: they're also allowing the top 80 00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:49.729 huda: 5 followers or top 5 like participants to get like the Wolfarm, like professional subscription for I think, a year, and also they're eligible, for, like one of their scholars, like $500 scholarships, they can apply for that if they win, and they also receive like a certificate from them, which is also high value. 81 00:15:50.308 --> 00:15:57.489 huda: And then with the Xyz they're providing 15 domains to everyone, which I think was 82 00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.139 huda: $10 in value. But yeah. 83 00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.249 Jenny Duan: Wait. So where does the rest of the 13,000 come from? The. 84 00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.369 huda: The 13,000. 85 00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.980 huda: Yeah, it's like the value of the of like the subscriptions and everything. 86 00:16:11.407 --> 00:16:17.599 huda: Yeah. So we're trying to like, have some more like practical prizes like keyboards, or like 87 00:16:18.056 --> 00:16:23.269 huda: maybe like a camera, or some like a small camera or something like that. But yeah. 88 00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:29.259 huda: I think, for now we're trying to get more sponsors. Cause like a lot of the hackathons have a lot of sponsors. 89 00:16:29.634 --> 00:16:32.540 huda: But yeah, I think a little more cold mailing might help. 90 00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.143 Jenny Duan: That's still really awesome that you were able to get them to sign on. I think that that's like 91 00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:46.930 Jenny Duan: very impressive thing, and it seems like that's gonna be good for attracting traction. How many people are signed up? Total right? Or have you started distributing yet? 92 00:16:47.811 --> 00:17:07.029 huda: We just kind of just started distributing, but",
    " kind of minimally. And we already have like 6 to 7 signups. And they're from like like around the world like I saw. There's someone from France. There's someone from Canada. There's like a bunch of people from America like I think it's it's pretty national right now. 93 00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.029 Jenny Duan: That's awesome. 94 00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:16.488 Jenny Duan: And for your sign ups like, or sorry for the organization of the hackathon. 95 00:17:17.149 --> 00:17:18.259 Jenny Duan: how does 96 00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:23.229 Jenny Duan: how like? How does the programming work. What kinds of events are you planning as of right now? 97 00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:38.280 huda: Yeah. So right now, I'm like, kind of planning, like an opening ceremony where? We kind of introduce, like us the board members where they can like come and contact us for anything, and then we introduce the judges 98 00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:48.420 huda: and then, like the theme and everything, and then also like, say, like the schedule and then after that, there's gonna be like a couple I wanna do like 99 00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:56.192 huda: 2 to 3 workshops in the 1st day, and then, like maybe like 2 or one workshop the second day 100 00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:22.490 huda: which I think like the best way to like get workshops is through like other nonprofits, cause they're pretty like eager about it. But yeah, them. And then I also wanted to have like a panelist type thing. So if we do get a couple more judges they could like have like a panel, and then that way, like the people who are competing can also, like introduce themselves to the judges, and then also, like kind of 101 00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:29.450 huda: they could talk about their journey as like a woman in stem and stuff like that. So I think that's like how we want to do it. 102 00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:54.230 huda: And then the judges, like they have, like like a rubric on dev post where they can like choose, like they can like kind of ",
    "grade each project. And then we wanna we wanna set up like a few themes. And then we also we wanna publicize this a lot. So I'm giving like the social media manager, like lots of responsibility. And so I'm asking her to like. 103 00:18:54.230 --> 00:19:08.539 huda: kind of go around like, get screen recordings of like testimonials and like people in action. So that way, we can, like, you know, have like lots of Tiktoks and like Youtube videos about it. And also just like pictures, so that we can like distribute it on our site. 104 00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:22.347 huda: and then. I was thinking of doing something like a fun theme like who has the most creative, like Tiktok about the hackathon or something, and that could have like a prize category. 105 00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:28.060 huda: and then, yeah, it's gonna be from July 20th to 21st 106 00:19:28.763 --> 00:19:29.690 huda: and like. 107 00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.970 Jenny Duan: Good that you're planning so far in advance. 108 00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.719 huda: Yeah, I wanna I wanna cause I know hackathons usually take. 109 00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:43.320 huda: for like professional hackathons, they take like 2 months. But like since we're kind of short on time. I wanna do like in a month. 110 00:19:43.756 --> 00:19:52.180 huda: But yeah, and then I think this is gonna drive our engagement the most from, like all our events. So far. So, yeah. 111 00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.570 Jenny Duan: Awesome and then 112 00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:02.400 Jenny Duan: I was just gonna ask, like, how many people is your target goal for the hackathon? And like how many people are on the organization team. 113 00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.169 huda: Right now. It's just the 5 of us 114 00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.350 huda: but in my goal. So most hackathons have, like like 115 00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:20.474 huda: around like 400 people. But I'm aiming for like 200 people to join just as like a baseline. But 116 00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.740 hud",
    "a: yeah. 117 00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:26.219 Jenny Duan: Okay, awesome. Can you? Do you have a zoom pro plan that accommodates so many. 118 00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:29.384 huda: We we're planning to hold it on discord. 119 00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:30.550 Jenny Duan: Very cool. 120 00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:37.749 huda: Yeah, so we can like present. And then we can have like different channels. For, like the different workshops and such, and so on. 121 00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.929 Jenny Duan: Cool? Why discord versus another platform? Just curious. 122 00:20:43.614 --> 00:20:53.989 huda: I feel like it's really like everything in one place, because that's we're gonna where, like, we already have a discord for the hackathon where? That's where they gonna have like questions. 123 00:20:54.307 --> 00:21:08.110 huda: That's where I don't know. They can like join our workshops stuff. So I was thinking, like if we just have, like all our like kind of meetings and calls and stuff there, it'll just be a lot more easier to like. Keep up with. 124 00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.935 Jenny Duan: Alright! Got it? 125 00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:17.319 Jenny Duan: That's super cool, and then have the other people on your team been responsive in planning and helping. 126 00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:32.055 huda: So far we've like I kind of. We've kind of been taking it lightly. But then yesterday I set us up on dev post, and like got the sponsors and everything. So now they're a bit more like interactive with it. So 127 00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:45.720 huda: my social media manager, she's been like creating some posts and like stories and stuff. And then I told her a plan. So she's gonna post every day on her story like a countdown to the hackathon. Just so. It like builds more hype 128 00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.060 huda: and then 129 00:21:49.140 --> 00:22:00.949 huda: and then, like also my vice president, she's been helping with, like, you know, planning with the logistics like, she's gonna be helping me ",
    "like, create the slides for the opening and closing ceremony. 130 00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:02.449 huda: She's gonna help. 131 00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:09.950 huda: Yeah, kind of with the more logistics like helping coming up with like the schedule and stuff like that. And then 132 00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.690 huda: the 133 00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:32.130 huda: secretary, she's gonna be helping with like kind of reaching out or not. Secretary. Sorry the director of Outreach. She's gonna like contact more nonprofits for like collaborations with a workshop. She's already been been doing pretty well with like collaboration Instagram posts. We've organized a couple. 134 00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.400 huda: I think. 135 00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:46.144 huda: 4 or 5. So far we have them lined up, but we haven't posted them yet. But yeah, we've like thought of ideas and kind of started like, I ideating about it. But 136 00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:53.340 huda: yeah, I think she's been in charge of like like solidifying like our workshop. Schedule. 137 00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.960 huda: And then I don't really have any responsibilities with for my treasure yet. 138 00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.370 huda: But I was thinking of 139 00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:06.539 huda: having her, maybe like contact more sponsors, or maybe 140 00:23:08.112 --> 00:23:12.240 huda: maybe just helping with support during the overall like Hackathon. 141 00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.650 Jenny Duan: Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh. 142 00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.380 Jenny Duan: Hi, Saraj! What's up. 143 00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:25.780 Ivylevel: Oh, nothing, nothing like i i oh, sure, I wanted to be like in a stealth mode. Oh, my God, you guys, you guys, how are you doing on your. 144 00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.320 Jenny Duan: Have you heard who does exciting news about her? Hackathon. 145 00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:37.149 Ivylevel: Yes, and you know this is Huda right like she has not been excited about it. I don't know why, l",
    "ike right. 146 00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.089 Jenny Duan: It. It's amazing she got. She got so many cool sponsors. 147 00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:46.430 Ivylevel: That's a huge thing, right? Like, I don't have any sponsor. I have to spend my own money. So yeah. 148 00:23:47.450 --> 00:24:05.330 Jenny Duan: It is amazing, like all of this wolf from Alpha's like sponsoring. That's amazing. And all the cold emailing is is actually working cause. Now she has, like guest speakers. She's got other nonprofits to lead workshops. She has over 13,000 in prizes sponsored. 149 00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.080 Jenny Duan: which is really amazing. 150 00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:19.340 Ivylevel: Amazing. But also did she take some time to reflect this with you? One thing that I I find like missing. Again, not just from a call. It admissions, but also probably that's needed. Right? You were talking about experiences and reflection. 151 00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.050 Ivylevel: I think these are the moments where students have to reflect, I would imagine, right. 152 00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:35.320 Ivylevel: because it's really a part of where they've come from, you know, like not having any impact versus doing it might again. I don't want to distract, but might be something that you can always add, like you know, where I want that to. Also like write down like her reflection. 153 00:24:36.281 --> 00:24:38.669 Ivylevel: It's part of our story, right? So. 154 00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.350 Ivylevel: Greg. 155 00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:52.339 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Yeah. Huda, do you have any reflections on what this is like? And like the process of cold outreach, and finally getting responses. 156 00:24:52.690 --> 00:25:08.895 huda: I think it's definitely been like, kind of tiresome. I'd like, I definitely did like a lot of research like I looked at a bunch of other hackathons like in dev host itself, and seen like who sponsors them, and then trying to reach out to their sponsors. 157 00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:",
    "18.092 huda: that's kinda like how I discover, like the people to cool. Reach to. But obviously not all of them replied or like accepted. But 158 00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:26.090 huda: I think what's also ironic, is like the club that Hackathon Club, the one that was kind of like 159 00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.129 huda: exclusive 160 00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.699 huda: They had, like a hackathon 161 00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:43.089 huda: as well like La Co. Last 2 years. They've been hosting Hackathon, and now it's kind of like odd to be like the person like hosting the hackathon and actually there's like. 162 00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:53.620 huda: yeah, I don't know. I just feel like being in. I've always like participated in hackathons and like seeing like how much work goes into just like programming is pretty interesting. And 163 00:25:54.387 --> 00:26:10.922 huda: also, I feel like this, this event could be like one of the best events for empowering AI cause we wanna keep like everyone who signs up or like whoever everyone who participates, we're gonna like have their emails. And you know, like, store them for, like our newsletter, and then 164 00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:17.949 huda: also, like the discord like, they have to join the discord. And we're gonna convert that to like our empowering AI discord. 165 00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:31.910 huda: And then that way, we can like have a larger community. So I think I'm really excited for this Hackathon project. I just wanna like, try and get like as much engagement as possible, so like, make, like the most out of this event. 166 00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:48.989 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And it seems like it's really good that we're finally getting some metrics for your success, because in terms of like the amount of prizes sponsored the number of attendees, and like that's starting to pick up, which is really important, because I know what we were missing earlier was like that aspect of collecting metrics. 167 00:",
    "26:49.442 --> 00:26:50.710 Jenny Duan: Ross, do you have something to. 168 00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:58.999 Ivylevel: Yeah, I think my question now as a dad is like to, Jenny, right? Because I see this as a as a huge success. You know, transformation here, right? Like 169 00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:22.110 Ivylevel: I mean, I mean, literally, I'm like viewing as a founder. You know, it's it's a good metric to say that you've got sponsorship and what? What do you think Jenny like has been the main reason why, like with us, able to like make this change now, like, of course you know, with all your guidance like I mean, and you can be quite open about it as a parent, I would love to know, like, you know, why were things like not possible earlier and like, what is the change 170 00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:29.650 Ivylevel: that you see? In Huda? That's kind of driving some of these results. 171 00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:50.044 Jenny Duan: I think that the biggest change, in my opinion, is just who does proactiveness in reaching out. I think that that's just been really impressive and impactful to see that like she's taking the initiative. And I didn't even tell. I'm not telling her to, you know. Reach out to Wolf from. I didn't tell her to reach out to Xyz. I didn't tell her to reach out to all these speakers, but like 172 00:27:50.300 --> 00:28:14.090 Jenny Duan: now, she has this drive initiative that she can do it without direct instruction. Like, if I just say, Okay, you should reach out to like sponsors in general. Or Oh, you should, you know. Maybe get some other nonprofits to collaborate with you like she can take that direction, and she doesn't need to be told like exactly who to reach out to, or exactly what to reach out about. She can do it herself, and like be super proactive. And I think that's really awesome. 173 00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:23.779 Ivylevel: That's amazing. And just to know, like, you know, was this part of your game plan of your one of your strategies to? Becau",
    "se we knew that one of the week spots was really against scaling our impact. 174 00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:32.620 Ivylevel: So I would also like to understand, like, you know, where was that line in terms of your kind of guidance to her. And how did she pick up from? Where did she pick up and and do it? 175 00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:47.052 Jenny Duan: I think it's just been over time, I think, like in the beginning I used to tell her more everything. That she needed to reach out to in the context. But now 176 00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.509 Jenny Duan: But now I think she's been way more proactive. 177 00:28:51.110 --> 00:29:00.190 Ivylevel: But I think these were like the strategies that you were intentional about, like, you know. Now you kind of try like hustling like trying a few things. You know, things stick and things you don't. Yeah. So 178 00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.219 Ivylevel: that that was my kind of point. So okay. 179 00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:14.710 Ivylevel: good to know. This is great congrats to both of you all I mean. I you know. I think these are like some of the wins that are actually priceless. To be honest, right like as a parent like when I think about it. 180 00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.370 Ivylevel: Because what does it mean that, like, you know, she's now learned to 181 00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:39.020 Ivylevel: you know. At least she's getting some signal you know. That, you know, if she keeps consistently trying and being proactive like, you know. Anything is possible. Like, you know, I have no sponsor like. No one has actually ever wanted like to spend money like invest in my startup like so good luck, you know. Thank you. Thank you, Jenny. I think I love the the effort right? I mean, this is really 182 00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.820 Ivylevel: amazing. Sorry. I'm again going like 183 00:29:42.766 --> 00:29:43.999 Ivylevel: on mute. 184 00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:59.009 Jenny Duan: Yeah, and then, yeah, I was hoping to hear an update from some of your other o",
    "rgs as well. And then I think we can spend the last 20 min kind of doing like an assessment of where you're at in terms of college applications in general, and like some bigger picture overview. 185 00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:05.660 huda: Yeah. Also, I had. I had a question. So since we're missing 2 extracurriculars, I was wondering, like. 186 00:30:06.163 --> 00:30:13.119 huda: that project I made last year. Mht jobs. Would that qualify as an extracurricular. 187 00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:24.749 Jenny Duan: I think it would, except the issue is, you're not super active in in maintaining that or working on that. Still. So because of that. I feel like it 188 00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:30.200 Jenny Duan: is better if you list that under like a broader web development or something like that, just because 189 00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.930 Jenny Duan: you aren't super. 190 00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.539 Jenny Duan: You are super active in maintaining that. 191 00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.810 huda: Okay, that makes sense. 192 00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:44.449 Ivylevel: So I'll tell you what has happened on that right? Of course, I think the website was something that Buddha did. And we started. 193 00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.740 Ivylevel: And then we actually create a Whatsapp group 194 00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.550 Ivylevel: and 195 00:30:48.540 --> 00:31:02.520 Ivylevel: you know, that has been the interface. And actually, there are some amazing metrics. The growth has been amazing. But I think the thing is that without left that hug said, oh, this is all like all like grown ups and uncles, you know. I don't want to be in this group. So she left that. So I I'm sorry with that. But 196 00:31:03.477 --> 00:31:07.290 Ivylevel: it now belongs to me, so you just can't use it. So 197 00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:08.770 Ivylevel: I'm disconnect. 198 00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.655 Ivylevel: Yeah, but I think it's been quite active. You know, Jenny, I think just for you to feel good. 199 00:31:14.503 -->",
    " 00:31:32.770 Ivylevel: it's very. It's a very active Whatsapp group in hyper local community. A lot of new people join. People keep asking me that they want to join. You know. So I mean, we can bring up like stats from that as well. It was just a channel that was actually more that gained more traction than a website, you know, people hardly go to website and all that stuff. 200 00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:45.186 Jenny Duan: Wow, yeah, I mean, I think that just tells you that like sometimes, not, everything needs to be like a website, especially as a developer, like, sometimes it's okay to just 201 00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.120 Jenny Duan: sometimes it's okay to just like. 202 00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.940 Jenny Duan: build something that other people use, regardless of whether it's like a website or a link or something else. 203 00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:09.599 huda: Good. So so regarding this like if I put it under like web development, and then like and then kind of explain it a little bit. Would I be able to use those like metrics like from the Whatsapp group to kind of prove it's like 204 00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:18.009 huda: significance, like under like web development. Kind of like with the amount of people in the group, or like something like that. 205 00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.990 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I think that that's a really good idea. 206 00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.050 huda: Okay, it's 207 00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.200 huda: and yeah. 208 00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.360 Ivylevel: Yeah, I think, in short, like, Jenny, just be like Iv level. All you need is a document. 209 00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:35.799 Ivylevel: and you need a tracker, and you need zoom with whatever 210 00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:42.590 Ivylevel: issues, with bandwidth. And you need absolutely a fantastic coach and student pair. That's it. 211 00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.830 Ivylevel: Right 212 00:32:44.735 --> 00:32:45.240 Ivylevel: great. 213 00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.389 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that'",
    "s like, you just need whatever your audience wants. And then. 214 00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.685 Jenny Duan: furthermore, 215 00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:58.360 Jenny Duan: could you tell me about how your personal website and web development is going. 216 00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.030 huda: Yeah. So actually haven't gone too much time to like update stuff for folklip. 217 00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:17.969 huda: And also regarding like, I mean, like forklift on like my website? Because I haven't really gone like too many pictures or anything like about with folklift, which I think I should probably change. 218 00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:34.336 huda: But yeah. And then I think I I started up. A sub stack and also medium. I haven't posted on medium yet. But yeah, I'm trying to open have like an article on medium as well, and then 219 00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:51.669 huda: for folklift. We haven't gotten any new members. But I have drafted like a couple of like pieces. I want to post on folklift like, for example, or I think I don't know if I told you, but we also got like an international business for. 220 00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:52.039 Jenny Duan: Where are they? 221 00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.710 Jenny Duan: Tell me about this. 222 00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.360 huda: Oh, I think I'm with the 223 00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.849 huda: I'm sorry. I think I'm actually connected to my air pods. 224 00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.960 huda: Okay, it works now. 225 00:34:09.809 --> 00:34:17.560 huda: Yeah. So I got an international business. That was interviewed by like my vice President, who was in India. 226 00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:18.749 Jenny Duan: No. 227 00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.919 huda: Yeah. So had that article updated. 228 00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:26.239 Jenny Duan: You're going international and like all of your activities, that's super exciting. 229 00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:33.139 huda: Thank you. I'm trying to make it more international cause. I feel like that's like the best impact and lik",
    "e. 230 00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:55.719 huda: not really like not to be offensive. But like, I feel like people who are not from America work a bit like harder than like American like board members. So yeah, I think, like, it's been like a best experience, like working with people internationally. So I'm gonna try and find more people like that for folklift. But yeah, I think 231 00:34:55.719 --> 00:35:04.629 huda: the next step right now. I wanna like, obviously get like my own pieces out. But try and get more other like get other people. So I'm 232 00:35:04.789 --> 00:35:10.557 huda: depending on like how much engagement gets. I might have like a writing competition. 233 00:35:11.269 --> 00:35:14.509 huda: But again, like, I don't know like how much engagement it might get. 234 00:35:15.819 --> 00:35:19.197 huda: yeah. So I think that one's like, 235 00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:24.069 huda: don't have too much of an update about that one. But yeah, and like 236 00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:27.929 huda: let me see what other updates? 237 00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:42.139 huda: yeah, wait. So like the panel that I'm doing. So would that like, could I put that under like the description for the Nc. Whit award cause. It is through like Nc. Wit. 238 00:35:42.532 --> 00:35:44.169 huda: and I kind of, I think. 239 00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.210 Jenny Duan: Sense to me. 240 00:35:45.855 --> 00:35:59.670 huda: And also like, I think it's really relevant to me because it's like explaining for like technology in education, and like, I could talk about some Thoria. So yeah, I think I think it's pretty relevant. But yeah. 241 00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.758 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that makes sense to me as well. 242 00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.049 Jenny Duan: cool. So that's pretty much everything. Are there any other? Let me see 243 00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.779 Jenny Duan: any other. Do you have an update on the Youth Action Committee? Have you been going to those. 244 00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:25.",
    "378 huda: Oh, no, I thought you I thought you said it wasn't like kind of worth like kind of going to, because I won't be able to get a leadership position, but 245 00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.840 Jenny Duan: Yeah, just. But just in general, like, have you been able to network with the people there? 246 00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:36.090 Jenny Duan: And I guess that's what I meant to ask like, do you get to know the the adult leaders of it at all? Or is that no. 247 00:36:36.922 --> 00:36:46.409 huda: I haven't gone to but like kind of related to empowering AI my! My vice president reached out to 248 00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:52.820 huda: like the Mayor and one of the people from the Education Board, I think. 249 00:36:53.410 --> 00:37:05.639 huda: oh, sorry the compute. The Community Service Board and she like reached out to them to see if they'd be able to sponsor any of the prizes. So yeah, we've been like kind of doing that. 250 00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.255 huda: But I was also thinking of 251 00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:23.324 huda: like getting to know like our like. There's like a trustee for a school district. And she's like actually replied to my likes and see what announcement for the school. So I was like kind of thinking of connecting with her, so that we can 252 00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.549 huda: possibly do some sort of like 253 00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:34.090 huda: like interview, or something like that for maybe folklift, or just in general just getting to know her. But yeah. 254 00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.439 Jenny Duan: That sounds cool and and that sounds fruitful as well. 255 00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:52.450 Jenny Duan: okay. So just to recap, I think, like the biggest progress that you've made is the hackathon with empowering AI. Have you done any progress on synthoria and outreach on that front. 256 00:37:54.275 --> 00:37:59.094 huda: I haven't really gotten much progress on that end. 257 00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.200 huda: I mean. 258 00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:08.8",
    "49 huda: I've I've just like kind of been posting about it on Tiktok, but like nothing too much like I haven't cold mailed about that 259 00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.130 huda: too much. But yeah. 260 00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.420 Jenny Duan: Is that something that you'd be interested in doing or working on more. 261 00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:31.320 huda: I think I would. But I think like, for now I think it wouldn't be really helpful, because, like a lot of the teachers are like out on vacation, and like won't be able to reply reply, so I don't know if that would even be helpful. 262 00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.096 Jenny Duan: Got it. 263 00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:52.279 Jenny Duan: let's think about other ways to. I think that it's still possible for you to expand and and grow and share synth aria when even when schools not in session like, there's other ways that you can gain exposure to the game. Did the code of classy people ever respond to your like publicity, request email to them. 264 00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.779 huda: They haven't. 265 00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:59.019 Jenny Duan: Okay. How? How long ago did you send that? And do you wanna maybe send a follow up to them? 266 00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.310 huda: Yeah, I sent it on our call. So like. 267 00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.410 huda: I think it was Tuesday or Monday. 268 00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.440 huda: Okay. 269 00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.340 Jenny Duan: Was the follow up? Or that was the original email. 270 00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.749 huda: His original email. 271 00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.200 Jenny Duan: Okay. 272 00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.632 Jenny Duan: I think it's probably fine. If you send a follow up right now. 273 00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.519 Jenny Duan: why don't you do that? Yeah. 274 00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.170 huda: Does this look good? 275 00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.040 Jenny Duan: Let me see. 276 00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:04.975 huda: Oh, 277 00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.620 Jenny Duan: Yeah, that look",
    "s good. 278 00:40:08.744 --> 00:40:11.099 huda: She's in an hour should schedule send it. 279 00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.289 Jenny Duan: You can schedule, send it for tomorrow morning. 280 00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.390 huda: Look at it. 281 00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:25.209 huda: Yeah. No response from like the team. Vo person as well. But I think that's expected. 282 00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:31.070 Jenny Duan: I think that's fine. Did you find a list of other news articles or news places to pitch to. 283 00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.439 huda: Oh, that that kind of slipped my mind. 284 00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:38.355 Jenny Duan: Okay, why don't we do that right now? Actually, let's spend like 5 min and just compile like a list. 285 00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:44.009 Jenny Duan: Besides, team vogue. Let me think of other places. 286 00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:58.339 huda: Oh, yeah, I think I did. I looked for a couple, and there was like, New York times. But I think I don't think they're. I think it's just for the school year, so I don't think they're accepting any right now. 287 00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.710 Jenny Duan: I just found like a big list. 288 00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.810 Jenny Duan: Care. 289 00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.009 Jenny Duan: You see, this. 290 00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.940 huda: Oh, that's the same list I saw. 291 00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.329 Jenny Duan: Oh, okay, perfect. 292 00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.820 Jenny Duan: They have a ton. They have a ton 293 00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:17.980 Jenny Duan: to them. 294 00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.470 huda: Yeah, some of these are like inactive. But I can like 295 00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.850 huda: which you're like. 296 00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.057 huda: Also, I had a question about empowering AI. So 297 00:41:49.710 --> 00:42:15.120 huda: we wanted to do a thing where we just like make a bunch of like curriculum curriculums and just kind of like, have them on our website and have, like a lot of them about like different stem",
    " topics like maybe like different women in stem. And then, like, for example, something really similar to like the Synthoria lesson toolkit. And if we make like a lot of them. 298 00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:21.475 huda: do you think that's like valuable for empowering AI like, do you think that's something that we should actually like commit to or 299 00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.570 huda: Well, like we can stray away from the idea. 300 00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.990 Jenny Duan: So tell me more where these like toolkits would be distributed, and how that would work. 301 00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:53.660 huda: Yeah, so we're gonna make like, make them on like, maybe like Google Docs, or like, maybe like, make a Pdf for each of them. And then just like, have like a page on our empowering AI website with like a large directory of like lesson toolkits that people can use. And then, like, maybe do something similar to like Senoria, where we like reached out to teachers. 302 00:42:54.014 --> 00:43:04.720 huda: and then we can use like the same email, same emails that I contacted. But yeah, like, I think that would. I think that's what I was itating. But yeah. 303 00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:11.010 Jenny Duan: I think that that could work. What would be the effort on that like? How much time would that take. 304 00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:23.142 huda: I I don't think it should take too much time, because for one, I wanna like definitely get some help from some of the board members which don't have much to do like my treasure, and then also 305 00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:32.010 huda: like I think it would be it would be fine if we kind of use like AI for some of them like not completely. Because then that would like 306 00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:42.450 huda: that would just not be valuable. But like we, we can definitely like speed up the process with AI and like, come up with ideas, maybe like help format stuff. 307 00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:48.849 huda: But yeah, I don't think it should be too much eff",
    "ort. But yeah, we were thinking of creating like a lot of them, like, maybe, like 308 00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.420 huda: like a hundred, maybe like just if possible. 309 00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:02.960 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that that works. Then. I think that as long as it's not too much of a lift for you. And then I think that it it should be like 310 00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.129 Jenny Duan: it should be effective. And then what is your plan for distributing these again? 311 00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:20.939 huda: So similar thing with synthory. We were. We wanted to like cold email, a bunch of teachers, and I was saying, maybe we can use like the same emails for the centuria distribution, because they're kind of similar topics. 312 00:44:21.475 --> 00:44:28.060 huda: But yeah, like, I don't know, like again, like that wasn't really effective for centuria. But like 313 00:44:28.572 --> 00:44:34.920 huda: I feel like I don't know just again, like with the similar like distribution metric that would also be pretty helpful. 314 00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.496 Jenny Duan: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. 315 00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:43.280 Jenny Duan: I think that that seems like a good project and a good use of your summer. So 316 00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:59.340 Jenny Duan: as long as it's not too like high lift for you, I would say definitely, go for that and then finally, I was wondering 1, st 1st and Thoria back on that again, have? How is the social media been? And have you been able to gain more traction slash players through that. 317 00:45:00.482 --> 00:45:03.857 huda: Let me actually check the statistics for 318 00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:11.164 huda: for the game. But I did get like one of my videos. It was like 13,000 views by now. 319 00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.579 Jenny Duan: I think you mentioned that. That's awesome. 320 00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:18.239 huda: Yeah, it's still growing. But yeah, like, I think. 321 00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.183 huda: hold on, 322 00:45:26.",
    "670 --> 00:45:36.904 huda: I'm gonna look on like the analytics for Simplia. But okay, so right now we're at 390 plays. So not too like big, but 323 00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.940 huda: I think social media's definitely helped it. I think. 324 00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.260 Jenny Duan: Okay. 325 00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:56.539 Jenny Duan: I think that that's not too bad. That's that. Seems like it's grown a lot. How have their other videos been performing? And have you been consistent cause? I think that's awesome, like I feel like you've been making great progress. There. 326 00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:02.649 huda: Yeah, I've been like, I've been trying. So sometimes it's kind of hard for me to post 3 times a day. So I've been like. 327 00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:03.560 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I am. 328 00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.121 huda: Like once a day at least. 329 00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.460 huda: and then a lot of my videos, just like 330 00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:19.509 huda: text about like women and stem like random facts about women stem. I think those have been doing the best. Which kind of works out great cause like that's the kind of content that I want to create and stuff. 331 00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:30.599 huda: And so, like, I think, I've been making a lot of videos about like women in stem. And that's that's I'm glad that's the one that's doing well, not like the random videos. 332 00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:50.845 huda: But yeah, I think I think, I'm definitely trying to be a little more consistent with social media. And then also, like with my Instagram. I kind of did the similar trick to like the my nonprofit Instagram is where we kind of follow a couple of like nonprofits, and then, like you get like 400 followers in like 3 seconds. 333 00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.810 Jenny Duan: Yeah. 334 00:46:53.334 --> 00:46:58.420 huda: It's been working out, cause like I was stuck at like 70 for like the longest time. And now, like. 335 00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:03.150 huda: I'm kind,",
    " I'm like, I like 1, 50 and almost like nearing 200. So. 336 00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:04.600 huda: yeah. 337 00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.470 Jenny Duan: Hey? That's pretty good. That's pretty good. 338 00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:13.660 Jenny Duan: Okay, cool. Do we cover everything in terms of all your projects and extracurriculars? Or did I miss anything? 339 00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:14.450 Jenny Duan: I. 340 00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:16.600 huda: I think, currently, yeah, yeah, I think that's 341 00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.500 huda: actually for some Thoria, like, I was wondering. 342 00:47:21.007 --> 00:47:32.620 huda: like you said there was kind of like a bit of like like a slowdown on like the distribution. So like, is there anything I could be doing right now to like? Expand my impact with synthoria. 343 00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:48.159 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think what's in Thoria. So their primary target here is to get as many people to play as possible. That's the goal. And then other than that, like the extra, the extraneous projects. Or if you can get schools to adopt it in their learning toolkits, that's really awesome. I think 344 00:47:48.480 --> 00:48:10.739 Jenny Duan: trying to just be your own pr agent is gonna be the most difficult thing. So like that means reaching out to different publications. Actually, that's 1 thing that you can do reach out to different publications and see if they'll feature you your game like, for example. I know that there's a lot of like Indie gaming newsletters. I was wondering maybe you could find a list of those and start pitching Thoria to have them share in like a monthly or weekly newsletter. 345 00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:12.070 huda: Okay, yeah, 346 00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:13.580 huda: and 347 00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.050 huda: I think. 348 00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:43.550 huda: do you think so? A lot of people that I know like, just play on like their phones and stuff, and especially when I try to like, advertise synthory on my phone. It",
    "'s like they can't play the game because it's for computers. So then I was thinking like going back, and like, I've I've tried coding it for phones, but it's also kind of hard, and it might take a lot of time or not a lot of time. But like I might have to like focus on that more than like a few other extracurriculars. 349 00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:53.499 huda: So do you think it's like worth like doing that? Because I feel like I would be able to get like a lot more players if it was available for Mobile. But yeah. 350 00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.640 Jenny Duan: What would it look like to have an app. 351 00:48:56.762 --> 00:49:13.060 huda: So I don't know if I don't know if it'd possibly be like an app. But I could definitely like do thing where? I guess you can choose, like if you're on computer, or if you're on phone, and then if you're on phone, it gives you like, like the buttons to click, and then it, you can move with that. 352 00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:19.539 huda: But yeah, like, I think that might take some time implementing like every scene. But yeah. 353 00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:28.710 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I mean, I think if you can do mobile native, I think that's like, gonna be much better cause it opens it to be accessible to much more people. 354 00:49:29.046 --> 00:49:33.349 Jenny Duan: How much time would that take? Is that and slash? How difficult would that be. 355 00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.170 huda: Maybe if I dedicate like 356 00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:42.910 huda: 2 or 3 days to just like focusing fully on synthoria, I'd be able to make a bunch of improvements 357 00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:49.050 huda: and like, actually like, if I were to be able to turn it into an app 358 00:49:49.478 --> 00:49:57.041 huda: that could also be pretty good, because I could definitely like, have it on the app store. That would be like pretty significant 359 00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:09.320 huda: and like that, might take a little longer. But if I were to just like change the control",
    "s like on like the web. I think I should take like, maybe like 2 like dedicated days for that. But yeah. 360 00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:24.179 Jenny Duan: Yeah. Okay, then, that seems like a good idea. In that case I would. I would spend some time trying to make it like different playable on web. And I think 2 days is like not a lot of time when it comes to sacrif like sacrificing time for your summer 361 00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:37.269 Jenny Duan: cool. And then, before we just move into the broader assessment, are you ready to go to London like, how do you feel about your travel coming up and like wrapping up, making sure everything's set in the States before you leave the country. 362 00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:59.049 huda: I think I'm a bit nervous because of, you know, empower hacks. It's gonna be like kind of hectic from now on. Cause I'm trying to, I said. I made like a document with like kind of like instructions for each of the officers, cause I won't be able to work too much there, and so I won't be able to like fully, like focus on the slides, or, like, you know, create all those. 363 00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:17.609 huda: And so like, I kind of have, like a bunch of like instructions. But then, since, like the timings will be different and everything, it might be hard to to like contact and stuff like that. So I'm like kind of making sure that everything set but I really, really, I'm trusting my board members to like kind of follow through with, like the things that they're doing 364 00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:33.140 huda: and like, I just like kind of nervous like if they don't participate or like, if they don't do their goals, but I think I think I believe in them, and especially they have a lot of pressure, this new deadline as well. So I think it's going to work. 365 00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:42.169 huda: But yeah, I think I'm excited definitely for the trip. But yeah, I'm a bit nervous with, like my extra curriculums running in the background. 366 00:51:42.700 --> 00:5",
    "1:45.600 Jenny Duan: Do you have exciting things planned? What does your day to day look like. 367 00:51:47.060 --> 00:52:02.189 huda: Oh, we're probably just like we're going to like different places like the like the museum, and then sightseeing and everything. And then I don't know if I'd be able to like work when I come back. But like when I come back from like 368 00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:13.000 huda: touring, but like yeah, I think a few of the days we're probably just gonna like, look at, like some cool buildings like even like like Oxford, like the college. I think that would be pretty 369 00:52:13.806 --> 00:52:17.489 huda: and just like in general, that would be pretty cool. But yeah. 370 00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.260 huda: yeah. 371 00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:31.899 Jenny Duan: Happy to leave her home alone. Go to go to London, have so much fun. You're gonna have a great experience, and I think you'll learn a lot. How long are you gonna be there again? 372 00:52:32.866 --> 00:52:35.430 huda: For around like 9 to 10 days. 373 00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.775 Jenny Duan: Cool 374 00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.589 Jenny Duan: and is there anything like specific that you're especially excited for. 375 00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:53.749 huda: I'm definitely excited, for like the the red buses cause that's like we're gonna see like everything. And then also, like 376 00:52:54.146 --> 00:52:57.580 huda: it's just like cool. And then also, like the the phone boots. 377 00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:04.270 huda: And then I think the weather is gonna be really nice there. Cause right now, it's okay, like a really hot in California. And so. 378 00:53:04.522 --> 00:53:06.540 Jenny Duan: I think. Was it not hot in London? 379 00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.542 huda: I checked the I checked the 380 00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:14.080 huda: the forecast, and it's like literally like a high of 64 degrees. And that's like. 381 00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.949 Jenny Duan: That's cold. Oh, my gosh! 382 00:53:16.",
    "600 --> 00:53:18.809 Jenny Duan: But you like! Do you like cold weather? 383 00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:24.649 huda: Yeah, I love cold weather, cause like all my clothing is like sweaters and stuff, and I hate wearing T-shirts. 384 00:53:25.374 --> 00:53:27.149 Jenny Duan: School in Southern California. 385 00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.799 huda: I mean, actually. 386 00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.810 Jenny Duan: Good. 387 00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:35.560 huda: Older than it was a lot colder than the Bay Area. Strangely enough. 388 00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.980 Jenny Duan: That's a i don't know. That's like, gonna be a consistent pattern at Usc. But. 389 00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:46.090 huda: It was like a hundred 13 degrees here, and then it was like it was like 390 00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:49.099 huda: 80 in LA. And I was like. 391 00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:53.570 Jenny Duan: Okay, yeah, okay. I don't think it's 100 and thi 113, really, a mountain house. 392 00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:54.590 huda: Yeah. 393 00:53:55.750 --> 00:54:00.999 Jenny Duan: Oh, wow! Okay, I think La is colder than that. I that's so unexpected. Wow! 394 00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.460 huda: I was like really like. 395 00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:08.440 huda: and like kind of like the San Joaquin Valley. That's terrible weather. 396 00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:15.711 Jenny Duan: Wow, okay, understood. Okay, I I now I understand the the pain of of this. 397 00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:18.430 Jenny Duan: Okay, gotcha, 398 00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:44.910 Jenny Duan: alright. And I'm just curious now. I think we can spend. Not curious, but I think we can spend like 10 min talking about your plan. Slash your your, how you're doing for the rest of the summer, and like just rolling into college application season. So I think right now, as far as I can see, the biggest concerns are just filling out the rest of your extracurriculars. So adding the other 2 that you're missing right now and then. Oh. 399 00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:51.949 Jenny Duan: y",
    "eah, of course. Let me just spend 5 min talking about this, and then we can go through your concerns. Sarah. So I think 400 00:54:52.700 --> 00:55:11.429 Jenny Duan: the biggest thing is just filling out your extracurriculars list. I think this is like most pressing for you. And I think that the the we talked about a lot of different options in regards to your extracurriculars list? Have you decided on which 2 you wanted to go with out of everything that we discussed? And also, did you see the thing that I recently sent you via Instagram, DM. 401 00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.790 huda: Yeah. Yeah. 402 00:55:13.178 --> 00:55:35.851 huda: Yeah, I think, okay. So obviously applied to that. But for the last 2 extra curriculars, I think definitely like, the web development that has, like a lot of things that we could talk about like I've developed like the website for full cliff. I don't know if that directly goes under like web development. But I may see jobs. I think that's like, definitely a good thing to mention. And 403 00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.420 huda: I haven't been able to like freelance web develop yet. 404 00:55:40.848 --> 00:55:46.279 huda: Like, I'm having trouble like setting up prices like like that might be like 405 00:55:46.660 --> 00:56:02.043 huda: most attractive to people, and also like to my scale as well. So like, I think I'm gonna like, spend some time kind of out for free. I think I'll spend some time kind of like setting that up. But yeah, and 406 00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.389 huda: so I think web development. That might be a good one 407 00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.870 huda: and 408 00:56:07.688 --> 00:56:10.080 huda: for the last one 409 00:56:11.012 --> 00:56:24.059 huda: so I did apply to that like cafe job. But if I do get that program that you send me on Instagram, I think that'll be like, definitely like better than that. And 410 00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:29.350 huda: yeah, I I kind of forget, like what what other options we discussed. But yeah. ",
    "411 00:56:30.755 --> 00:56:36.454 Jenny Duan: I think the other option is just freelance web development, like which you already mentioned, and then 412 00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:41.200 Jenny Duan: getting more involved with these Action Committee, but like we kind of rolled that one out. 413 00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:43.610 Jenny Duan: So I think that it seems. 414 00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:48.099 Jenny Duan: I think, seems good. What we've discussed, and like having those 415 00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:54.859 Jenny Duan: having the web development be one, and then like participating in hackathons, that's another. Oh, that's another option. I don't know if we mentioned that. 416 00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.430 huda: I forgot to mention with hack club 417 00:56:59.465 --> 00:57:19.030 huda: they have like this thing called like hack arcade, and then they give. And then, like you, basically just like develop websites or like develop like anything through code which matches like the theme that they sent. And then, like, you can like like log in your hours, and if you log enough hours, you can like win prizes, and so like 418 00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:22.659 huda: like, would that be like kind of 419 00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:30.689 huda: productive for for that extracurricular or do I should I just like participate in hackathons if you think that's stronger. 420 00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:44.399 Jenny Duan: I think you should just participate in hackathons and try to win like. I think, as long as you're able to win prizes because you, I think, also have space for 2 more prizes, and your or 2 more awards on your awards list, and so, like Hackathon prize could be a good place to do that. 421 00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:45.015 huda: Okay. 422 00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.129 Jenny Duan: Cool, and then, Sarah, she wanted the last 5 min. 423 00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:52.190 Ivylevel: Yeah. 424 00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.910 Ivylevel: Have you met Samia Jenny before. 425 00:57:55.811 --> 00:58:00.480 Jenny Dua",
    "n: I don't think I have. I think I've been meaning to, but I don't think. 426 00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.190 Ivylevel: Yeah. 427 00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.740 Jenny Duan: Her. 428 00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.869 Ivylevel: I just wanted to introduce like this is Samia and you know. 429 00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:08.980 Jenny Duan: Oh, Hi, super! Nice to meet you! I'm Jenny. 430 00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.733 Ivylevel: Nice to meet you, too. Heard lots of great things about you. 431 00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:16.879 Jenny Duan: Oh, thanks! Are you? Are you excited for London, too? Are you going on the trip. 432 00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.310 Ivylevel: Yeah, I'm excited. I've been like looking forward to it for a while. 433 00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.399 Jenny Duan: Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun. I really wanna go to London. I haven't been in like 434 00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:25.710 Jenny Duan: the years. 435 00:58:26.024 --> 00:58:28.400 Jenny Duan: So I don't really remember most of it, but 436 00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.790 Jenny Duan: I've heard it's really funny. 437 00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.010 Jenny Duan: Pardon. 438 00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.850 Ivylevel: I hope you get to go soon. 439 00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:42.550 Jenny Duan: Thanks. Yeah, I really hope so, too, except I'm in New York this summer, which is really really fun. And I I do, Miss California, but, like New York is, is very, very fun. 440 00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.360 Ivylevel: You know, just like so full of energy. 441 00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:53.669 Ivylevel: So yeah, I mean, you can ask. You know, like, you know, Samia, actually wanted to do one session with you as well, Jenny, like it's it's just that. 442 00:58:54.182 --> 00:58:59.027 Ivylevel: This like I mean, you're in so much demand. And you know. 443 00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:08.539 Ivylevel: you know such well revered and so popular here like, you know. I think in terms of just like getting some rigor on like her searching for internship. 444 00:59:08.560 --",
    "> 00:59:23.359 Ivylevel: and, you know, preparing her resume and profile and all that. So I think I think that you know, even though she's designed but to be very honest, I think it's it's all the same at the end of the day, right? So that that kind of skill and rigor so might be one session whenever you're free, like, you know. 445 00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:27.729 Ivylevel: would love to avail. Yeah, I think Buddha is more than happy to kind of, 446 00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:32.610 Ivylevel: you know. Give away like you know, gift one of her sessions to Samia. 447 00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.680 Ivylevel: Well. 448 00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:52.410 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I would love to help, I think, like definitely recruiting and internship cycles are super tough and like, I definitely empathize with like your search, which I know you'll be having to go through in the fall. That was me last year, and I remember how painful it was. So you know you've got this. 449 00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.720 Ivylevel: Thank you. Yeah, I've been. I I've been like, kind of 450 00:59:55.810 --> 01:00:07.349 Ivylevel: like out of the student board. And I'm thinking, well, I need to actually start, you know, looking into internships. So kind of the transition is a little difficult. But that's what I'm trying to get into now. 451 01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:12.576 Jenny Duan: Yeah. And are you looking for design like uiux? Or are you looking for like product? Design? 452 01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:15.379 Jenny Duan: What were you looking for? 453 01:00:15.673 --> 01:00:29.450 Ivylevel: I really want to get more into product design, because this past year I've been part of clubs that are very into the literal Us design using figma, which is great. But I kind of wanted to go into more of the product design 454 01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:49.420 Ivylevel: area as well, but really anything just to get in the industry like, really get my hands dirty and like, try, I mean, you can actually join a startup, you know, like,",
    " I mean, this is the saddest part, like startups are inviting you all. And you guys all want to go and have a coffee like a free coffee in adobe and other places. That's what it is. That's fine. 455 01:00:50.970 --> 01:01:01.450 Jenny Duan: I think startups and big industry are all good, like I've I've done a couple of startup internships, and they've been super fun right now I'm in like a big company, and like that's also nice, too. 456 01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.046 Ivylevel: Great thanks. 457 01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:13.013 Ivylevel: yeah. So I I did have a few questions on you know who does profile so? I think 458 01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:24.542 Ivylevel: might be, you know, we can probably do it in the next time. Really like. Wanted to kind of understand the why behind, you know, like some of the weak spots like, if we were to do like a game plan. Now, to be honest. 459 01:01:25.158 --> 01:01:37.299 Ivylevel: I have feeling like, you know, I'd send you a text message as well. Right, Jenny, so maybe we can do it next time. But what are like your top weak spots that you see today, like, you know, I know that extracurriculars is an area. But 460 01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:55.539 Ivylevel: I you know, just to, I feel like, you know, Huda also needs to know, like, you know why, certain things are important. Of course, there's like a scale and impact that we keep talking talking about, but also in terms of why is a hackathon important? Or why is like, you know, a civic engagement important, you know, if you can actually throw some more light there. 461 01:01:55.883 --> 01:02:08.220 Ivylevel: Because how does it really impact her narrative and her profile strength? Right? And then also on the award side. So, you know, can you give a bit of like, you know, light you know, kind of insights on that. 462 01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:11.740 Jenny Duan: Yeah, I think that who does biggest 463 01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:39.660 Jenny Duan: pain point right now is just having more credibility wh",
    "en it comes to extracurriculars. And that comes with working with more established, either working with more established organizations, or having more people involved in her projects, because right now, who does profile is pretty much heavy towards the self initiated sense, and that, like most of her, things, are just things that she's initiated herself. But a lot of other people's profiles, and you don't have to be like everyone else. But a lot of other people's profiles are are involved with like larger organizations that 464 01:02:39.660 --> 01:03:04.570 Jenny Duan: have a lot of the backing. And this means that who does like putting in a ton of extra effort to like initiate most things herself, which is very impressive. But I do think that she's missing like that sort of credibility there, that companies, larger organization. So I think that's why I'm like sending her lots of things to apply to, to see like, if she can affiliate herself with the larger org, or just build out her her credibility more by like getting more metrics for hers. 465 01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:12.440 Ivylevel: Okay? So I think that's more the recognition about it. Right? Some validity right around her. Initiatives, primarily. So you kind of need like 466 01:03:12.765 --> 01:03:22.460 Ivylevel: big logos and symbols. Right? Like sponsoring now is, actually gives a a kind of a credibility. Right? That, okay, this is like a credible kind of hackathon initiative, that kind of stuff, correct. 467 01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:24.330 Jenny Duan: Yeah, exactly. 468 01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:47.619 Ivylevel: But then, what about like, you know? Because I think one of the things was thanks, Samia. One of the things was also around you know, like your leadership. I know that. You know there are a couple of items in terms of when you're looking at extracurriculars right. Some of the areas where I think she's got her passion. You know. There are some unique things, I think in terms of passion in terms of I don't ",
    "know, like, you know, stem and leadership like there were a couple of things right? 469 01:03:47.620 --> 01:04:00.810 Ivylevel: So and I know that you have been pushing her quite hard to get involved on advocacy. And you know, civic engagement and reaching out to politicians and all that stuff. So I really wanted to understand the why behind it. 470 01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:11.103 Jenny Duan: Yeah. I think that the reason why I've been pushing her, and also I have to be mindful. I have a meeting with Anushka right now, so I have to hop off pretty soon. But. 471 01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:15.000 Ivylevel: Later. Yeah, I think we can talk about this later. No worries. 472 01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:36.930 Jenny Duan: Okay. But I do think like civic engagement just shows her leadership. And like again, Atlanta, with, like the bigger picture like, why does advocacy matter? Why does it matter in the long term? Oh, so she can affect policy and like, make higher level impact. That's why it just shows like in the future, what kind of direction she might take in terms of her career, and like how she might use what she's studying in school to like impact the world in a bigger picture way. 473 01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:59.950 Ivylevel: Okay, amazing. So, Jen, Jenny, I know that. You know we don't have like, you know. after I I don't like. I I probably need like an hour, because you know it would be good. I've sent a message, let me know, like, you know, because there are some game plan reports, and you're free to join the game plan sessions like the second sessions on weekend. But if not, at the least like you know. I I would just love to run all the game plan ready right now. 474 01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.500 Jenny Duan: Oh, cool! Sounds good! 475 01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.420 Ivylevel: Let me know bye, take care! Thanks."
