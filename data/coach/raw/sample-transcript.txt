JENNY: Hey Alex! How are you feeling about everything this week?

ALEX: Honestly, pretty overwhelmed. I have three essays to write, my robotics competition is next month, and my parents keep asking about my college list.

JENNY: It makes sense you're feeling stuck—this is a lot. Let me ask you: which of these is making you lose sleep right now?

ALEX: Probably the essays. I don't even know where to start.

JENNY: Okay, let's not worry about all three essays right now. Let's just handle one part together. Which essay prompt speaks to you the most?

ALEX: The one about a challenge I've overcome. But I feel like my challenges aren't impressive enough.

JENNY: I hear that. But here's the thing—colleges aren't looking for the biggest challenge. They're looking for how you think through challenges. Can you tell me about a time when something didn't go your way and you had to figure it out?

ALEX: Well, in robotics last year, our team's design completely failed at regionals. We had to rebuild everything in 48 hours.

JENNY: Now we're talking. That's real. That's the kind of resilience they want to see. Let's build from there. Before we dive into writing, I want you to just talk it through with me—no pressure, no perfect sentences. Just tell me: what was going through your head when you realized the design failed?

ALEX: I was terrified. I thought we'd let everyone down.

JENNY: And then what happened?

ALEX: We stayed up all night. I took charge of coordinating the rebuild because I realized someone had to, or we'd all panic.

JENNY: There it is. That's your story. You didn't start out as the leader—you became one because the situation demanded it. That's a narrative colleges love. Now here's what we're going to do: I want you to write just the first paragraph this week. Not the whole essay. Just the opening scene—the moment you realized the design failed. Can you do that?

ALEX: Yeah, I think so.

JENNY: Good. And Alex—this doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be honest. I'll be here to help you shape it. You've got this.

ALEX: Thanks, Jenny. I actually feel like I can breathe now.

JENNY: That's the goal. One step at a time. We'll get there together.
